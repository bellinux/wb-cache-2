40|$|Central to {{a number}} of {{emerging}} Smart Cities are online platforms for data sharing and reuse: <b>Data</b> <b>Hubs</b> and <b>Data</b> Catalogues. These systems support the use of data by developers through enabling data discoverability and access. As such, the effectiveness of a Data Catalogue {{can be seen as the}} way in which it supports `data exploitability': the ability to assess whether the provided data is appropriate to the given task. Beyond technical compatibility, this also regards validating the policies attached to data. Here, we present a methodology to enable Smart City <b>Data</b> <b>Hubs</b> to better address exploitability by considering the way policies propagate across the data flows applied in the system...|$|R

50|$|Sharing the {{architectural}} core with Stratature +EDM, Master Data Services uses a Microsoft SQL Server database as the physical data store. It {{is a part}} of the Master <b>Data</b> <b>Hub,</b> which uses the database to store and manage data entities. It is a database with the software to validate and manage the data, and keep it synchronized with the systems that use the data. The master <b>data</b> <b>hub</b> has to extract the data from the source system, validate, sanitize and shape the data, remove duplicates, and update the hub repositories, as well as synchronize the external sources. The entity schemas, attributes, data hierarchies, validation rules and access control information are specified as metadata to the Master Data Services runtime. Master Data Services does not impose any limitation on the data model. Master Data Services also allows custom Business rules, used for validating and sanitizing the data entering the <b>data</b> <b>hub,</b> to be defined, which is then run against the data matching the specified criteria. All changes made to the data are validated against the rules, and a log of the transaction is stored persistently. Violations are logged separately, and optionally the owner is notified, automatically. All the data entities can be versioned.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the Linked Data principles, a tripleset {{should be}} {{interlinked}} {{with others to}} take advantage of existing knowledge. However, interlinking is a laborious task. Thus, users interlink their triplesets mostly with <b>data</b> <b>hubs,</b> such as DBpedia and Freebase, ignoring the more specific yet often even more promising triplesets. To alleviate this problem, this paper describes a tripleset interlinking recommendation tool based on link prediction techniques and evaluates the tool on a real-world tripleset repository...|$|R
30|$|The {{architecture}} {{designed by}} Echelon was {{radically different from}} the leading technological paradigm of that time. According to received wisdom sensors and actuators would be wired through a hierarchical set of <b>data</b> <b>hubs,</b> which would route all information towards a central computer that would execute operations and issue appropriate commands back to local devices. By contrast, Echelon set out to implement a distributed control architecture. Each device would be endowed with its own microchip, and each device {{would be able to}} communicate with any other.|$|R
30|$|Nodes {{with the}} higher token are awarded {{with the higher}} {{privilege}} to transmit, which guarantees {{a better quality of}} service for the urgent <b>data.</b> Then, the <b>hub</b> assigns additional allocation slots for the burst data and writes the allocation interval in the second-round allocation assignment frame. It should also be emphasized that if the remaining allocation slots are insufficient to transmit all the burst <b>data,</b> the <b>hub</b> will deny to assign allocation slots for nodes with lower token.|$|R

The BBSRC funded project GRASPgfs “Geospatial Resource for Agricultural Species, pests and Pathogens with workflow integrated modelling to support Global Food Security” initiated the design and prototype of an e-infrastructure linking together (i) a geo-germplasm database, (ii) a dynamic metadata catalog and (iii) a workflow modelling tool to enable optimal usage of the geo-genetic-trait information. This is desired in various types of simulations for crop trait variation, forecasts under climate forcing scenarios and crop disease epidemics.|$|R
