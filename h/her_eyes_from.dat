500|$|The album's {{ethereal}} artwork mirrors its [...] "delicacy and introverted romance". The cover art, shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin in Los Angeles, California, is a {{black and}} white photograph of Björk lying down on the patterned ground next to a swimming pool, covering <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the sun and wearing her Marjan Pejoski swan dress that caused a stir at the 73rd Academy Awards. The duo M/M (Paris), known for applying and integrating their work on photographs (so called dessin dans l'image, or [...] "drawings in the picture"), illustrated the cover, featuring a swan and the album's title with feathers. Björk thought swans embodied Vespertines music, describing them as [...] "a white, sort of winter bird" [...] and [...] "very romantic". Vespertine came with a booklet of M/M (Paris) artwork.|$|E

2500|$|According to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is {{connected}} with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title [...] "child killer" [...] and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body {{from the waist up}} and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men’s blood. Her gift was the [...] "mark of a Sibyl", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was [...] "cursed" [...] to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> their sockets.|$|E
