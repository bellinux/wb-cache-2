25|$|In {{forms of}} {{myoclonus}} where {{only a single}} area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, Botox injections (OnabotulinumtoxinA) may be helpful. The chemical messenger responsible for triggering the <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions is blocked by the Botulinum toxins of the Botox.|$|E
25|$|These toxins attack {{cholinergic}} neurons (those {{that use}} ACh as a transmitter) by destroying acetylcholinesterase (AChE). ACh therefore cannot {{be broken down}} and stays in the receptor. This causes tetany (<b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction), {{which can lead to}} death. The toxins have been called fasciculins since after injection into mice, they cause severe, generalized and long-lasting (5-7 h) fasciculations (rapid muscle contractions).|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} and atrophy are inevitable consequences of α-MN lesions as well. Because muscle {{size and strength}} {{are related to the}} extent of their use, denervated muscles are prone to atrophy. A secondary cause of muscle atrophy is that denervated muscles are no longer supplied with trophic factors from the α-MNs that innervate them. Alpha motor neuron lesions also result in abnormal EMG potentials (e.g., fibrillation potentials) and fasciculations, the latter being spontaneous, <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions.|$|E
50|$|At the {{advanced}} levels, the currents which pulsate through the nerves {{and even the}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles</b> are {{turned off by the}} practitioner. This may also be accomplished through Pranayama or breath-control.|$|R
50|$|Amyl nitrite, {{in common}} with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator; it expands blood vessels, {{resulting}} in lowering of the blood pressure. Alkyl nitrites {{are a source of}} nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles.</b> Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles,</b> especially the blood vessel walls and the internal and external anal sphincter. There are no withdrawal symptoms. Overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypoventilation, shortness of breath, and fainting. The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes. Amyl nitrite may also intensify the experience of synesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Smooth {{muscles are}} {{controlled}} {{directly by the}} autonomic nervous system and are involuntary, meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought. Functions such as heart beat and lungs (which are capable of being willingly controlled, be it to a limited extent) are <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles</b> but are not smooth muscles.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of silicone breast implants requires the metallic element Platinum (Pt., 78) {{as a catalyst}} to accelerate the transformation of silicone oil into silicone gel for making the elastomer silicone shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices. The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum {{is present in the}} surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the bone marrow, from where blood cells might deliver it to nerve endings, thus causing nervous system disorders such as blindness, deafness, and nervous tics (<b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions).|$|E
25|$|Another less {{lethal weapon}} that police {{officers}} often carry is an electroshock gun, {{also known as}} a Taser. The handheld electroshock weapon was designed to incapacitate a single person from a distance by using electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons.|$|E
25|$|Irritability is {{most often}} noticed along with {{the first signs of}} nervous system impairment. Within {{the first few years of}} life, {{extrapyramidal}} involvement causes abnormal <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users.|$|E
25|$|For example,Iguanahearts, {{like the}} {{majority}} of thesquamateshearts, are composed of three chambers with two aorta and one ventricle, cardiac <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles.</b> The main structures of the heart are thesinus venosus, the pacemaker, theleft atrium, theright atruim, theatrioventriular valve, the cavum venosum, cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, the muscular ridge, the ventricular ridge,pulmanary veins, and pairedaortic arches.|$|R
50|$|Smooth muscle cells {{make up the}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles,</b> {{which are}} found {{in most parts of}} the body, {{including}} the uterus, stomach and intestines, the walls of all blood vessels, and the skin.

25|$|Rheumatic fever (RF) is an {{inflammatory}} disease that can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain. The disease typically develops {{two to four}} weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. Signs and symptoms include fever, multiple painful joints, <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of cases. Damage to the heart valves, known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} and {{factors contributing to}} normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for gross continence of solid stool. The IAS is an <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle,</b> contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of {{the last part of}} the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these {{mechanisms and}} factors may be involved in the cause.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms vary {{according}} to the kind of dystonia involved. In most cases, dystonia tends to lead to abnormal posturing, in particular on movement. Many sufferers have continuous pain, cramping, and relentless muscle spasms due to <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> movements. [...] Other motor symptoms are possible including lip smacking.|$|E

60|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} peristaltic movements of the intestines are influenced by attention being paid to them at fixed recurrent periods; and these movements depend on the contraction of unstriped and <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles.</b> The abnormal action of the voluntary muscles in epilepsy, chorea, and hysteria {{is known to be}} influenced by the expectation of an attack, and by the sight of other patients similarly affected.[37] So it is with the involuntary acts of yawning and laughing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{doctor may}} order an {{electromyogram}} to diagnose muscle or nerve problems. This test measures <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> activity and muscle response to nerve stimulation.

2500|$|According to the {{recommendations}} made by the Quebec Task Force, treatment for individuals with whiplash associated disorders grade 1–3 may include non-narcotic analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed {{in the case of}} WAD 2 and WAD 3, but their use should be limited to a maximum of three weeks. Botulinum toxin A is used to treat <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction and spasms. [...] Botulinum toxin type-A is only temporary and repeated injections need to take place in order to feel the effects.|$|E
2500|$|Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME), {{also known}} as Janz syndrome, is a fairly common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, representing 5-10% of all epilepsy cases. This disorder typically first manifests itself {{between the ages of}} 12 and 18 with brief episodes of <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> twitching occurring early in the morning. Most patients also have generalized seizures that affect the entire brain and many also have absence seizures. Genetic studies have demonstrated at least 6 loci for JME, 4 with known causative genes.|$|E

2500|$|The disease {{typically}} develops two to {{four weeks}} after a throat infection. Symptoms include: fever, [...] painful joints with those joints affected changing with time, <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of cases. Damage to the heart valves usually occurs only after multiple attacks but may occasionally occur after a single case of RF. The damaged valves may result in heart failure and also {{increase the risk of}} atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.|$|E
2500|$|Dystonic tremor {{occurs in}} {{individuals}} {{of all ages}} who are affected by dystonia, a movement disorder in which sustained <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions cause twisting and repetitive motions and/or painful and abnormal postures or positions. [...] Dystonic tremor may affect any muscle {{in the body and}} is seen most often when the patient is in a certain position or moves a certain way. [...] The pattern of dystonic tremor may differ from essential tremor. Dystonic tremors occur irregularly and often can be relieved by complete rest. Touching the affected body part or muscle may reduce tremor severity (a geste antagoniste). [...] The tremor may be the initial sign of dystonia localized to a particular part of the body.|$|E
2500|$|Signs of JME are brief {{episodes of}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> {{twitching}} occurring {{early in the}} morning or shortly before falling asleep. This does not usually result in the person falling, but rather dropping objects. These muscle twitching episodes are more common in the arms than in the legs. Other seizure types such as generalized tonic-clonic and absence seizures can also occur. [...] Patients often report quick jerking movements in the morning that results in knocking over objects such as their morning orange juice. [...] Clusters of myoclonic seizures can lead to absence seizures, and clusters of absence seizures can lead to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. [...] The onset of symptoms is generally around age 10-16 although some patients can present in their 20s or even early 30s. [...] The myoclonic jerks generally precede the generalized tonic-clonic seizures by several months. Some people with the disorder never get generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs). [...] Sleep deprivation is a major factor in triggering GTCs. [...] College students often present with a GTC after [...] "pulling an all-nighter." [...] Patients with JME generally do not have other neurological problems.|$|E

50|$|Heart {{muscles are}} {{distinct}} from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other.

2500|$|Rhythmic Movement Disorder (or RMD) is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by involuntary (however may sometimes be voluntary), repetitive movements of large muscle groups immediately {{before and during}} sleep often involving the head and neck. It was independently described first in 1905 by Zappert as jactatio capitis nocturna and by Cruchet as rhythmie du sommeil. The majority of RMD episodes occur during NREM sleep, although REM movements have been reported. RMD {{is often associated with}} other psychiatric conditions or mental retardation. The disorder often leads to bodily injury from unwanted movements. Because of these incessant muscle contractions, patients’ sleep patterns are often disrupted. It differs from Restless Legs Syndrome in that RMD involves <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions before and during sleep while Restless Legs Syndrome is the urge to move before sleep. RMD occurs in both males and females, often during early childhood with symptoms diminishing with age. Many sufferers also have other sleep related disorders, like sleep apnea. The disorder can be differentially diagnosed into small subcategories, including sleep related bruxism, thumb sucking, hypnagonic foot tremor, and rhythmic sucking, to name a few. In order to be considered pathological, the ICSD-II requires that in the sleep-related rhythmic movements should “markedly interfere with normal sleep, cause significant impairment in daytime function, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury that requires medical treatment (or would result in injury if preventive measures were not used)” ...|$|E

60|$|As {{the basis}} of this theory rests on mental {{attention}} having some power to influence the capillary circulation, {{it will be necessary to}} give a considerable body of details, bearing more or less directly on this subject. Several observers,[33] who from their wide experience and knowledge are eminently capable of forming a sound judgment, are convinced that attention or consciousness (which latter term Sir H. Holland thinks the more explicit) concentrated on almost any part of the body produces some direct physical effect on it. This applies to the movements of the <b>involuntary</b> <b>muscles,</b> and of the voluntary muscles when acting involuntarily,-- to the secretion of the glands,--to the activity of the senses and sensations,--and even to the nutrition of parts.|$|R
