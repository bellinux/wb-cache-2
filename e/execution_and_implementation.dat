5000|$|Distinctions {{are drawn}} in {{describing}} the art game as a genre compared to traditional video game genres (such as the platformer or first-person shooter). Rather than describing the game on a surface level, descriptions focus on the artistic intent, {{as well as the}} <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementation</b> of the gameplay. For instance, Bethesda's 2008 release Fallout 3 {{is considered to be a}} role-playing game with first-person shooter elements, but it could also be considered to have elements consistent with art games - it implements moral player choices for the sole purpose of provoking emotion or thought in the player. There are several recent instances of video games that similarly involve the characteristics of art games, such as Braid and Undertale. Games like these aren't necessarily created or marketed under the classification of [...] "art game", but are still created for artistic purposes that transcend their respective structures. The potentials and limitations of the medium are increasingly discovered as the video game industry develops, therefore resulting in the recent popularity of art game elements. If nothing else, the genre can be seen as a means to push the medium to its conceptual limit.|$|E

Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP) design approach is key trend in designing flexible architectures. The ASIP concept implies dynamic scheduling {{of a set of}} instructions which generally leads to an overhead related to instruction decoding. No-Instruction-Set-Computer (NISC) concept has been introduced to reduce this overhead through the adoption of static scheduling.

An aspect of the complexity, the demand for robust and fault tolerant embedded solutions is ever increasing. Consequently the embedded system design and development face new challenges including modeling, representation, <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementation</b> issues. These issues cannot be addressed adequately without a matching underlying system architecture. Model integrated computing (MIC) architectures relying on multi-aspect modeling and variety of models of computation are proven to be promising alternatives for designing and generating manageable complex computing systems for various application domains. With respect to implementation one of the substantial questions is how the MIC based (self-) adapting design can be mapped into a (reconfigurable) distributed hardware platform. The paper presents a novel middleware supporting execution of adapting/reconfigurable real-time programs.

40|$|This paper investigates March’s (1991, 1993) {{concepts}} of ‘exploration’ and ‘exploitation’ {{in relation to}} the graduate labour market. We focus on its use of the imagery of potentiality as key criterion of employability and investigate its dimensions through March’s conceptual framework. We argue that the balancing act of exploring and exploiting one’s potential becomes one of the main coordinates through which contemporary organisations attempt to configure the profile of the future employee. An ambidextrous ideal employee is configured who is trapped between the continuous demands of routinised production, <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementation,</b> and those of equally sustained experimentation, self-expression, and creativity. We conclude by arguing that this ideal can be interpreted as another example of an unsustainable utopian image of work in the context of contemporary management. The theme of potentiality illustrates the dangers of this utopia in a specific way. On the one hand, it plays the role of an inescapable framework guiding the individual’s sense of self, whilst on the other hand, it predicates the self based upon an image of limitless potential...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} {{framework}} to enable interorganiza-tional workflow collaboration, considering the requirements of workflow design and support of different knowledge backgrounds of organizations. With the global expansion of Internet and distributed computing en-vironments, computer mediated collaboration has been rapidly increasing among different organizations. In these collaboration environments, organi-zations cooperate with one another with resources that each owns to achieve some common goals. Collaboration processes that involve multiple organi-zations can be modeled as interorganizational workflows, with challenges in some aspects. First, different organizations have different cultural and knowledge backgrounds, which might have great impact on the way that the collaboration is conducted. Therefore, when considering interorganizational workflow, many problems occur due to disagreements on views regarding the collaboration processes. Moreover, though cooperation of organizations needs some visible interactions and data sharing, it is also important for organizations to consider the requirements of workflow design as much as possible during the collaboration, such as privacy preservation, flexibility support of local processes, workflow reuse and so on. In this thesis, with respect to the above points, we address following issues on interorganizational workflow collaboration framework including modeling, coordination, <b>execution</b> <b>and</b> <b>implementation</b> approaches...|$|E
