5|$|Details on Buffalo's {{early life}} are sparse. Although <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been favored by British traders and {{decorated}} by British authorities, few Ojibwa from Lake Superior fought {{in either the}} American Revolution or the War of 1812. There is no record of Buffalo participating.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{teacher is}} also unknown. It is often assumed Ruisdael studied {{with his father}} and uncle, but there is no archival {{evidence}} for this. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists, most notably Cornelis Vroom and Allaert van Everdingen.|$|E
5|$|The third ealdorman, Æthelweard, today {{best known}} for his Latin history, ruled in the west. Æthelweard was a {{descendant}} of King Æthelred of Wessex and probably the brother of King Eadwig's wife. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a supporter of Edward rather than of either faction.|$|E
60|$|He paced awhile in silence. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Retired: Sometime in late 1992. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> just unceremoniously {{dropped out}} of racing during 1992.|$|R

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
5|$|During Æthelwig's abbacy, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{acted as}} the deputy for Ealdred, as bishop of Worcester. In 1062, {{he was one}} of the {{candidates}} to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to Archbishop of York, but Wulfstan was chosen instead. Æthelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and Regenbald, the chancellor. The abbot also led military forces in battle, and served King Edward as an advisor.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of regulus, perhaps {{implying}} that he held the junior kingship of Kent. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to inherit the throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald's, but the charter is a forgery, probably dating from the eleventh century.|$|E
50|$|Dancie's {{work does}} not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been reprinted after 1623, nor does <b>he</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{referenced}} in any future text.|$|R

5|$|Echmarcach first {{appears on}} record in about 1031, {{when he was}} one of three kings in {{northern}} Britain who submitted to Knútr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 10361038 and 10461052. After losing Dublin for the final time, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin, Echmarcach appears to have been expelled from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{played his}} last game in 1980 but made a return 6 {{years later to}} play in the 1985/86 Sheffield Shield season.|$|R

5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In March 1866, a {{month after}} the fall, Eddy and her husband (then married for 13 years) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn. At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted, unable to pay the $1.50 weekly rent. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{returned}} briefly—they moved to a boarding house in July, and in August he paid Dr. Cushing's bill from the fall—but the marriage was over. He sent her $200 a year for a time, and they divorced in 1873.|$|E
5|$|Pain's family {{originated}} in Normandy, {{but there is}} little to suggest that he had many ties there, and <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spent most of his career in England and the Welsh Marches. A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115, he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of Ludlow and its castle, which he augmented with further acquisitions.|$|E

60|$|Happening {{to catch}} a glimpse of her face as she was speaking, and noticing that her attempt at heartiness was a miserable failure, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> misgivings.|$|R
5000|$|Besides the Noctes Vaticanae, <b>to</b> which <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> contributed, Borromeo's written legacy {{consisted}} only of some homilies, discourses and sermons, with {{a collection}} of letters. Borromeo's sermons have been translated into many languages.|$|R
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} {{as to the}} identity of Buffalo's father, who {{may also have been}} named Andaigweos. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a descendant or relative of the famous war chief Waubojeeg. When he was about 10, Buffalo and his parents moved from La Pointe to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo, New York, and lived there until about he was about 12. The family relocated to the Mackinac Island area for a while before returning to La Pointe. In his youth, Kechewaishke was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} {{literature of}} Jainism {{does not mention}} the worship of Ganesha. However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, for whom <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, Kubera. Jain ties with the trading community {{support the idea that}} Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections. The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century. A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the {{successive}} {{rise and fall of}} the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E
60|$|Of course Jarwin {{lost this}} pretty speech in {{consequence}} of its being a mute reply, but <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some intuitive perception of it, for he stooped down and patted the dog's head affectionately.|$|R
5000|$|His self-effacing {{nature and}} boyish {{demeanour}} served to defuse passions {{in many of}} these hotly disputed cases. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no ego, although the consensus is that he was both highly intelligent and very persuasive.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, senhor, {{it was far}} to the west. The {{travellers}} {{who brought}} him on said they found him almost insensible {{on the banks of}} a stream into which <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fallen or been thrown." ...|$|R
5|$|A son of King Harald Hardrada, Magnus was in 1058 {{appointed}} nominal {{leader of}} an expedition into the Irish Sea while still only a child. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> assisted Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia in their struggles against the English, although his primary objective {{may have been}} to assert control over Orkney. He later accompanied his father in Harald's campaign against Denmark in 1062, and was appointed regent and made king before Harald's fatal invasion of England in 1066. Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter, until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> {{dive into}} Reed's knees. A brief scuffle ensued. Berger {{apparently}} {{tried to break}} it up. At that point the spitting was supposed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> occurred. Walker denied the incident being intentional.|$|R
50|$|His {{body was}} found by police on 18 November 1998 {{at his home in}} Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow, where he had lived alone since the end of his second marriage. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> died some days earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Fuller-Clark also {{designed}} Boulting's Offices at Riding House Street, which OUP describe as [...] "a remarkably free composition", {{as well as}} 40 and 41a Foley Street, London in about 1908. In 1912, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in Jamaica.|$|R
