He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.|$|E

Pre-Columbian trade routes to kingdoms and empires such as the Mound Builders existed {{in places such as}} Yellowstone National Park since around 1000 AD. Major settlement of the western territories developed rapidly in the 1840s, largely through the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush of 1849.

25|$|The {{reign of}} shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi after the {{deposition}} of Mossadegh in 1953, {{was the most}} prosperous era for the Jews of Iran. In the 1970s, only 10 percent of Iranian Jews were classified as impoverished; 80 percent were middle class and 10 percent wealthy. Although Jews accounted for {{only a small percentage}} of Iran's population, in 1979 two of the 18 members of the Iranian Academy of Sciences, 80 of the 4,000 university lecturers, and 600 of the 10,000 physicians in Iran were Jews.

25|$|Commitments by Schwarzenegger {{delayed the}} start of filming by several months. The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter David Peoples. Principal {{photography}} eventually began in the jungles of Palenque, Mexico, near Villahermosa, Tabasco, during {{the second week of}} April 1986, but the film overall was filmed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Much of the material dealing with the unit's deployment in the jungle was completed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the dailies provided by McTiernan. On Friday, April 25, production halted so that Schwarzenegger could fly to Hyannis Port in a Learjet chartered by Silver {{in order to get to}} his wedding on time. He was married on April 26, 1986, to Maria Shriver, and honeymooned for only three days while the second unit completed additional lensing. The production resumed filming on May 12.|$|E
25|$|The {{two full}} weeks of festivities were devised in meticulous detail by Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. It was a {{dazzling}} display of pomp, power and split second timing. Neither the earlier Delhi Durbar of 1877, nor the later Durbar held there in 1911, could match the pageantry of Lord Curzon’s 1903 festivities. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> {{months at the}} end of 1902, a deserted plain was transformed into an elaborate tented city, complete with temporary light railway to bring crowds of spectators out from Delhi, a post office with its own stamp, telephone and telegraphic facilities, a variety of stores, a Police force with specially designed uniform, hospital, magistrate’s court and complex sanitation, drainage and electric light installations. Souvenir guide books were sold and maps of the camping ground distributed. Marketing opportunities were craftily exploited. A special Delhi Durbar Medal was struck, firework displays, exhibitions and glamorous dances held.|$|E

25|$|Many island species evolved {{on small}} islands, or even {{restricted}} habitats on small islands. Small populations {{are vulnerable to}} even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to predators. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of tameness. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that moas were hunted to extinction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the dodo, {{are thought to have}} become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the Pacific islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.|$|E
500|$|Operation Anvil was a {{crushing}} success. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> weeks, the French and American forces drove the Germans from southeastern France and captured major ports including Marseille on 28 August. On 15 September 1944, the 6th Army Group became operational, assuming control of Patch's Seventh Army and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army (as it became on 19 September). The French First Army {{was the largest}} French force ever amassed under a foreign military leader. Eisenhower's SHAEF assumed operational control of the 6th Army Group, although Devers retained his own logistical system via the Mediterranean. [...] The campaign was not without cost, and concurrent combat in Normandy and Italy created a shortage of replacements, especially infantry, that left VI Corps about 5,200 men short.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{credits include}} Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, {{and a regular}} at Abbey Road. [...] She had worked on pop {{material}} and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. [...] The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. [...] Gilmour {{was in charge of}} the session, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. [...] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. [...] For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. [...] The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [...] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.|$|E

[...] Although hostilities in northern China were suspended during these negotiations, Taiwan and the Pescadores were specifically excluded from the scope of the armistice.

2500|$|Mt. Stromboli {{has been}} in almost {{continuous}} eruption for the past 2,000 years. A pattern of eruption is maintained in which explosions occur at the summit craters, with mild to moderate eruptions of incandescent volcanic bombs, at intervals ranging from minutes to hours. This Strombolian eruption, as it is known, is also observed at other volcanoes worldwide. Eruptions from the summit craters typically result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short,</b> mild, but energetic bursts, ranging up to a few hundred meters in height, containing ash, incandescent lava fragments and stone blocks. Stromboli's activity is almost exclusively explosive, but lava flows do occur at times when volcanic activity is high: an effusive eruption occurred in 2002, the first in 17 years, and again in 2003, 2007, and 2013–14. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magma, improving prediction of volcanic activity./SO2 ratio|last=Aiuppa|first=Alessandro|first2=Cinzia|last2=Federico|first3=Geatano|last3=Giudice|first4=Paolo|last4=Papale|date=2008-10-11|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=2016-09-27}} ...|$|E
