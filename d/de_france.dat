5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race.

5|$|The 1904 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was {{the second}} Tour <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its {{previous}} edition, 1903 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won {{four of the six}} stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory four months after the race. The problems caused the Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was run with different rules from the 1903 and 1904 edition.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was {{the third}} edition of the Tour <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto. Following the disqualifications after the 1904 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> there were changes in the rules, {{the most important one}} being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the Tour <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|The doping {{scandal in}} the 1998 Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> didn't affect the team directly, but Riis, {{who was part of}} the peloton in the Tour <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> was branded a doping cheat in the Danish media in early 1999. He sold his stock in Professional Cycling Denmark.|$|E

5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île <b>de</b> <b>France</b> his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île <b>de</b> <b>France</b> could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île <b>de</b> <b>France</b> and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île <b>de</b> <b>France</b> Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E

Support riders on the squad included Yaroslav Popovych, Chris Horner, and Janez Brajkovič.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} French {{garrison}} on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley {{had turned his}} attention eastwards to Isle <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> The British commander had decided {{that the best way}} to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the harbours through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the harbours, effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in Sirius and Willoughby in Nereide, with instructions to begin by seizing Île de la Passe at the entrance to the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle <b>de</b> <b>France.</b>|$|E

The buildup of forces {{was prompted by}} the defeat at Grand Port combined with the heavy losses of East Indiamen during 1809 and 1810; the British authorities were determined to end {{the threat posed by}} the French squadron on Isle <b>de</b> <b>France</b> before the hurricane season made travel in the region too dangerous. In fact, the threat from Isle <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was already substantially reduced: the damage suffered by the French frigates in the engagements at Grand Port and during September could not be repaired with the available naval supplies on Isle <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> In addition, food supplies were running low due to the large number of British prisoners on the island and morale had collapsed in the aftermath of Hamelin's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory.

Brother Fränk said his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour <b>de</b> <b>France</b> before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E
