5000|$|Suppose a {{photographer}} has a flash device with a <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 44 (m)&thinsp;/&thinsp;144 (ft), [...] sets the camera’s aperture to , {{and wants to}} know the required flash-to-subject distance; he merely divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by 4. Thus, a subject 11 meters or 36 feet away will be correctly illuminated (GN&thinsp;44 (m)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;11 m, and GN&thinsp;144 (ft)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;36 ft).

50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (<b>guide</b> <b>number</b> 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank.

5000|$|High-end flash units {{address this}} problem by {{offering}} a mode, typically called FP sync or HSS (High Speed Sync), which fires the flash tube multiple times during the time the slit traverses the sensor. Such units require communication with the camera and are thus dedicated to a particular camera make. The multiple flashes result in {{a significant decrease in}} <b>guide</b> <b>number,</b> since each is only a part of the total flash power, but it's all that illuminates any particular part of the sensor. In general, if s is the shutter speed, and t is the shutter traverse time, the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by [...] For example, if the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 100, and the shutter traverse time is 5 ms (a shutter speed of 1/200s), and the shutter speed is set to 1/2000 s (0.5 ms), the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> reduces by a factor of , or about 3.16, so the resultant <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> at this speed would be about 32.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{if one has}} an {{established}} flash-to-subject distance and wants to find the required f-number, one divides the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> by the distance.

5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your full-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 48 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the flash device is set to 1/16&thinsp;th power. Divide 1 by 16 to obtain 0.0625. Take the square root of that (the [...] button on a calculator), which equals 0.25, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 48 to obtain a reduced-power <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 12.0.|$|R

50|$|Many flash {{devices have}} auto- or manual-adjust zoom {{features}} that permit the illumination angle to be widened (lessening the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> to fully illuminate the image area of wide-angle lenses, or narrowed (increasing the <b>guide</b> <b>number)</b> for telephoto lenses. Such coverage angles {{may be given}} in degrees but are often expressed as being equivalent to lens focal lengths for full-frame, 35 mm cameras. Manufacturers’ advertising practices vary as to the angle of coverage underlying their <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> ratings, {{in large part because}} some flash devices can be zoomed whereas others are fixed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is a step-by-step example of using the above formula: Suppose your <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> is 32 (it is irrelevant if it is scaled for meters or feet for this purpose) and the rated loss of the filter is 1.5 fstops. Take 0.5 and raise it {{to the power of}} 1.5 (using the [...] button on a scientific calculator), which equals roughly 0.35355. Take the square root of that (the [...] button), which equals approximately 0.595, and multiply that by the <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 32 to obtain a filtered <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of 19.0.|$|R

50|$|When a flash {{device is}} used for filling in shadows (fill flash) in sunlit scenes, {{it is capable of}} doing so only at {{distances}} that are a function of its <b>guide</b> <b>number.</b> The maximum <b>guide</b> <b>number</b> of the flash device establishes the maximum possible distance at which it can be used.|$|R
30|$|In rice, a QTL for grain <b>number</b> per panicle, <b>Gn</b> 1, was mapped on {{chromosome}} 1 {{and later}} found {{to consist of}} two loci, QTLGn 1 a and QTLGn 1 b, with a single QTLGn 1 a locus increasing grain number by 21 % [3]. Gn 1 a encodes a gene for cytokinin oxidase–dehydrogenase (OsCKX 2), which can effectively degrade cytokinin; hence, reduced expression of OsCKX 2 is causal to higher accumulated cytokinin in inflorescence meristems and to increased grain number, leading to a higher yield potential [3]. Moreover, two agriculturally useful traits, grain <b>number</b> (<b>Gn</b> 1 locus) and plant height (sd 1, the rice Green Revolution gene), have been successfully combined into a common genetic background (QTL pyramiding), thereby generating a new superior variety having both beneficial traits [3].|$|R
