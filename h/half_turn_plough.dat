50|$|To tie the hitch {{around a}} pole, begin by passing the working end a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round the pole. Next, pass a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round the {{standing}} part. Then, pass a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round both the working {{end and the}} standing part, above the first turn (i.e. closer to the pole). Finally, push a bight of the working end {{through the middle of}} the hitch - between the two <b>half</b> <b>turns,</b> and between the standing part and the working end. Pull on the standing part to tighten, if necessary sliding the hitch snugly up against the pole.|$|R
50|$|A turn can be {{subdivided}} in {{many different}} ways: into <b>half</b> <b>turns,</b> quarter turns, centiturns, milliturns, binary angles, points etc.|$|R
5000|$|Each side is {{permitted}} to turn in only 180° increments or <b>half</b> <b>turns.</b> Due to the gears not making a full rotation along with the side it's attached to, it prohibits 90° turns. This {{is the reason why}} all of the algorithms involve either <b>half</b> <b>turns</b> or a full rotation.|$|R

25|$|Pods of many dolphin species {{commonly}} herd {{a school}} of fish into a bait ball while individual members take <b>turns</b> <b>ploughing</b> through and feeding on the more compacted shoal. Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. Some dolphins take this further with strand feeding, driving prey until they are stranded on mud banks, {{where they can be}} easily accessed. Dolphins have also been observed blowing bubbles to startle and separate individual fish from a bait ball.|$|R

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{results for}} the six-vertex model {{with a variety of}} boundary conditions. Adapting an algorithm proposed by Allison and Reshetikhin for domain wall boundary conditions, we examine some modifications of these boundary conditions. To be precise, we discuss partial domain wall boundary conditions, reflecting ends and <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> boundary conditions (domain wall boundary conditions with <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> symmetry).

60|$|The long, long {{thoughts}} of boyhood! We elders smile at them. The little world spins round; the little voices {{of an hour}} sink hushed. The crawling generations come and go. The solar system drops from space. The eternal mechanism reforms and shapes itself anew. Time, <b>turning,</b> <b>ploughs</b> another furrow. So, growing sleepy, we murmur with a yawn. Is it that we see clearer, or that our eyes are growing dim? Let the young men see their visions, dream their dreams, hug to themselves their hopes of enduring fame; so shall they serve the world better.|$|R

In a rare form of the Broom Dance the broom is put through a crouching, tripping movement (at Jaszszentandras). <b>Half</b> crouching, <b>half</b> <b>turning</b> figures were still being danced by the older generation in the 1970s.|$|R

25|$|Some predators, such as dolphins, hunt {{in groups}} of their own. One {{technique}} employed by many dolphin species is herding, where a pod will control a school of fish while individual members take <b>turns</b> <b>ploughing</b> through and feeding on the more tightly-packed school (a formation commonly known as a bait ball.) Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin takes this one step further with what {{has become known as}} strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.|$|R
