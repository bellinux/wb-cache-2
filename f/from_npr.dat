500|$|Danny Goldberg from Gold Village Entertainment {{opined that}} the Parental Advisory label offered minimal value other than [...] "being {{a way for}} certain {{retailers}} like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as 'family friendly'"; he felt that children were successful in getting content they desired [...] "even before the Internet", and believed that the label had little impact on sales figures. In contrast, the RIAA maintains that [...] "it's not a PAL Notice that kids look for, it's the music". They stated that research they had gathered revealed that [...] "kids put limited weight on lyrics in deciding which music they like, caring more about rhythm and melody" [...] and implied that the label is not a deciding factor for a given purchase. Tom Cole <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> commented that the Parental Advisory label has become [...] "a fact of music-buying life", which {{made it difficult for}} current consumers to understand the widespread controversy that came about from its introduction.|$|E

The Guardian ranked Bangerz thirty-fourth on their list of the forty best albums, commenting that it [...] " [...] people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends" [...] despite initially opining that [...] "the attention-seeking begins to grate". Rolling Stone placed Bangerz at number twenty-seven on their list of the fifty best albums, writing that Cyrus [...] " [...] depth and vulnerability to {{one hell of a}} party [...] amid all the foam-finger hub-hub". Ann Powers <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> ranked the record tenth on her list of ten records, suggesting that it [...] "should earn her entry into every celebration of pop this year", while the Associated Press ranked it ninth for being [...] "banging". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle listed Bangerz as the fourth-best record of the year, calling it a [...] "fun, feisty pop album that produced two of the year's biggest, best singles" [...] and summarizing that [...] "with one flick of her tongue, Cyrus easily outdoes recent fare from Gaga, Katy and Britney." ...|$|E

500|$|Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger [...] "throws himself completely" [...] {{into the}} role, {{and that the}} film {{represents}} Nolan's [...] "most accomplished and mature" [...] work, and the most technically impressive and resonant of all the Batman films. Levy calls the action sequences {{some of the most}} impressive seen in an American film for years, and talks of the Hong Kong-set portion of the film as being particularly visually impressive. Levy and Peter Travers conclude that the film is [...] "haunting and visionary," [...] while Levy {{goes on to say that}} The Dark Knight is [...] "nothing short of brilliant." [...] On the other hand, David Denby of The New Yorker said that the story is not coherent enough to properly flesh out the disparities. He said the film's mood is one of [...] "constant climax," [...] and that it feels rushed and far too long. Denby criticized scenes which he argued to be meaningless or are cut short just as they become interesting. Denby remarks that the central conflict is workable, but that [...] "only half the team can act it," [...] saying that Bale's [...] "placid" [...] Bruce Wayne and [...] "dogged but uninteresting" [...] Batman is constantly upstaged by Ledger's [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] performance, which he says is the film's one element of success. Denby concludes that Ledger is [...] "mesmerising" [...] in every scene. The vocalization of Christian Bale's Batman (which was partly altered during post-production) was the subject of particular criticism by some commentators, with David Edelstein <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> describing Bale delivering his performance with [...] "a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever". Alonso Duralde at MSNBC, however, referred to Bale's voice in The Dark Knight as an [...] "eerie rasp", as opposed to the voice used in the Batman Begins, which according to Duralde [...] "sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an ‘adult’ voice to make prank phone calls".|$|E

Meanwhile, Ann Powers <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> Music characterised Back to Black as [...] "a full embrace of classic rhythm and blues." [...] Music journalist Chuck Eddy credits Ronson and Remi's production for resembling Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique and surrounding Winehouse with brass and string sections, harp, and the Wurlitzer. PopMatters writer Christian John Wikane said that its [...] "sensibilities of 1960s pop and soul" [...] are contradicted by Winehouse's [...] "blunt" [...] lyrics and felt that [...] "this particular marriage of words and music mirrors the bittersweet dichotomy that sometimes frames real relationships".
