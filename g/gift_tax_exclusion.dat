In general, the Act lowered tax rates and simplified retirement and qualified plan rules such as for individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans, 403(b), and pension plans.

50|$|A {{juvenile}} {{life insurance}} policy typically requires a minimum of $700 of annual premium, which provides approximately $100,000 of face value. The policy owner may utilize the <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion</b> amount (up to $13,000 per person per year per child, in 2010) to help pay the annual premium and avoid gift tax liability. Face amounts for juvenile life insurance policies of this type range from $100,000 to $10,000,000.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, similar {{provisions}} are often added to life insurance trusts or [...] "ILITs" [...] {{in order to}} maintain the annual <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion</b> by funding the ILIT using Crummey powers.

However, since the beneficiary is a minor, Parent B has 30 days to ‘claim’ the funds (on behalf of their child). Parent B signs a release to state that the funds will not be claimed and after 30 days the funds pass to the trust without any further action by either the parent or beneficiary.|$|E

(2) Does it extend that exemption to the rents and profits arising from tenancy by the entirety property? (3) Will the provisions for management of entirety property by husband and wife generate a theory of estoppel by acquiescence?

(6) Does the act intend to shift management and control of pre-enactment entirety property?

Where a jurisdiction has both <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> and inheritance tax, it is usual to exempt inheritances from <b>gift</b> <b>tax.</b> Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of <b>gift</b> <b>taxes,</b> by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death.

5000|$|The {{gift tax}} is a {{backstop}} to the United States estate tax. Without the gift tax, large estates {{could be reduced}} by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential estate tax. Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 {{at a much lower}} rate than the estate tax, a full 25% under the estate tax rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under estate tax. The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the estate tax rate.|$|E
50|$|The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) {{is an act}} in {{some states}} of the United States that allows assets such as securities, where the donor has given up all {{possession}} and control, {{to be held in}} the custodian's name {{for the benefit of the}} minor without an attorney needing to set up a special trust fund. This allows a minor in the United States to have property set aside for the minor's benefit and may achieve some income tax benefit for the child's parents. Once the child reaches the age of majority (18 or 21 depending on the state), the assets become the property of the child and the child can use them for any purpose. Contributing money to an UGMA account on another person's behalf could be subject to gift tax; however, the Internal Revenue Code of the United States allows persons to give up to the annual <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion</b> to another person without any gift tax consequences, and gifts exceeding that amount as long as total gifts are below the lifetime limits.|$|E
5000|$|Clinton enacted Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 which reduced {{taxes for}} many small business. Furthermore, he signed {{legislation}} that increased the tax deduction for self-employed business owners from 30% to 80% by 1997. The Taxpayer Relief Act reduced some federal taxes. The 28% rate for capital gains was lowered to 20%. The 15% rate was lowered to 10%. In 1980, {{a tax credit}} was put into place {{based on the number}} of individuals under the age of 17 in a household. In 1998, it was $400 per child and in 1999, it was raised to $500. This Act removed from taxation profits on the sale of a house of up to $500,000 for individuals who are married, and $250,000 for single individuals. Educational savings and retirement funds were given tax relief. Some of the expiring tax provisions were extended for selected businesses. Since 1998, an exemption could be taken out for those family farms and small businesses that qualified for it. In 1999, the correction of inflation on the $10,000 annual <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion</b> was accomplished. By the year 2006, the $600,000 estate tax exemption had risen to $1 million.|$|E

Effective long-term investment strategy and transfer taxation planning constitute key considerations in achieving those goals. This paper purposes {{to present a}} computerized projector model to facilitate sound investment strategy formulation for wealth accumulation and a feature to tax effectively transfer wealth by utilizing the annual <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion.</b> The model permits professional planners to “test drive ” different portfolios over different time periods to evaluate resulting portfolio outcomes and to assess available gifting opportunities. The model uses actual (not average) annual returns to permit the user to develop legacy portfolio investing and gifting strategies. The program tests scenarios such as target asset accumulations, portfolio mixes, income (payout) targets to donees, annual savings rates, allowable gift tax exclusions and valuation discount rates. These provide “personalized ” results which would have actually occurred over selected historical periods during their unique market environments. The authors demonstrate the model assuming a married couple accumulating a stock-oriented portfolio in a LLC (limited liability company) and gifting membership interests at valuation discounts. After experiencing steep portfolio losses in a recent bear market (2007 - 09), they seek professional advice.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to point out some of these difficulties and to discuss the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, which has been adopted in many jurisdictions, including Nebraska. Major difficulties are the inability of the minor to deal freely with property, and the widespread and justifiable hesitation to deal with infants. This problem becomes especially acute when a donor wishes to transfer securities because it is generally imperative for effective management that stock certificates be easily transferable. The objects of the act are (1) to provide a simple method of making gifts to minors which is standardized and orderly and (2) to satisfy the provisions of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code relating to the annual <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exclusion</b> of $ 3, 000 and to have the income from the gift taxable as a separate entity in the hands of minor.
