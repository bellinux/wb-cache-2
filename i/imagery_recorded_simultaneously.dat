50|$|A {{logic probe}} is a cheap, {{versatile}} and convenient digital test instrument, but can test {{only a single}} signal at a time. When many logic levels need to be observed or <b>recorded</b> <b>simultaneously,</b> a logic analyzer is used.|$|R
50|$|Despite these limitations, STS and STM {{provide the}} {{possibility}} for probing the local electronic structure of metals, semiconductors, and thin insulators on a scale unobtainable with other spectroscopic methods.

40|$|JPL image {{processing}} applications are examined, considering future trends in {{fields such as}} planetary exploration, electronics, astronomy, computers, and Landsat. Attention is given to adaptive search and interrogation of large image data bases, the display of multispectral <b>imagery</b> <b>recorded</b> in many spectral channels, merging data acquired {{by a variety of}} sensors, and developing custom large scale integrated chips for high speed intelligent {{image processing}} user stations and future pipeline production processors...|$|R
40|$|Wartime <b>imagery</b> <b>recording</b> the {{aftermath}} of bombing raids in Britain differs markedly from that depicting bomb damage in Germany and is closely bound up with narratives of cultural and national identity. In this article, the Blitz photographs of Cecil Beaton, as included in the book History Under Fire (1941), are analysed in relation to Eduardo Cadava's argument that Walter Benjamin's conception of history is developed through the language of photography...|$|R

5000|$|Esquivel's use of stereo {{recording}} was legendary, occasionally featuring two bands <b>recording</b> <b>simultaneously</b> {{in separate}} studios, such as on his album Latin-Esque (1962). The song [...] "Mucha Muchacha" [...] makes particularly mind-bending {{use of the}} separation, with the chorus and brass rapidly alternating stereo sides.|$|R
5000|$|Though <b>recorded</b> <b>simultaneously</b> in true stereo {{alongside}} a distinct mono mix, [...] "Come Fly with Me" [...] was released to record stores in 1958 in monaural only, a standard practice by Capitol records at the time. The label finally released the stereo version in 1962.|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{surveys in}} Syria have {{made use of}} <b>imagery</b> <b>recorded</b> some 30 years apart. By {{comparing}} the earlier pictures (Corona) with the later (Ikonos), sites captured on the former can be accurately located by the latter. The comparison also reveals the stark implications for archaeology as large parts of west Asian landscape change from a state of ‘benign neglect’ to active redevelopment. Based on their experience in the Homs survey, the authors have important advice to offer {{in the design and}} costing of surveys using satellite imagery...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} of a SC event <b>recorded</b> <b>simultaneously</b> by various instruments {{on the ground and}} in space has shown a surprisingly large variety of associated effects. Though our observations of these effects basically confirm the earlier results and can be principally understood in the framework of existing notions, some features still require additional consideration and modeling.|$|R
