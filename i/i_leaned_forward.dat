60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and touched}} her lips. Then I grasped her hands warmly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{in the cab}} {{to look at the}} {{placards}} of {{the afternoon}} papers.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> {{whispering}} {{into the}} ear of the Black One, and he nodded heavily.|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> {{and as we}} {{flip through}} the air, my stomach leaves my body. I am free falling, plummeting to the earth at 120 miles per hour. An inexplicable feeling of invincibility mixed with a humbling sense of my {{mortality}} wash over me. Intense adrenaline rushes out every extremity. Somehow, {{there is a huge}} grin on my face which wouldn’t disappear until long after I arrived back on the ground...|$|R
60|$|I strolled {{away for}} a few minutes to look into the cafe, where the waiters were {{preparing}} for luncheon. There was no sign of Louis. When <b>I</b> returned, Ashley <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to me {{from the other side of}} the desk.|$|R
60|$|As I did so, I kept a grip {{upon the}} man's arm, {{carrying}} it over one shoulder. Then <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> suddenly <b>forward</b> and hurled my antagonist {{over my head}} to a hasty fall at {{the opposite side of}} the hut. In the dim light of the interior I saw that Nobs had already accounted for one of the others--one who lay very quiet upon the floor--while the four remaining upon their feet were striking at him with knives and hatchets.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the look}} in her face, and my heart ached for her. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> in my chair.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Vigo stared, {{and passed}} {{his hand from}} his {{forehead}} backwards over his long hair. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> in my corner by the hickory fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead?" [...] I {{remember}} whispering. [...] "What {{is it you}} say?" [...] And <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> towards him, {{peering into}} his face. [...] "What is it you say?" ...|$|E
60|$|Exciting {{though it}} had been, however, its close was to be more so. Suddenly, without the least warning, we felt a sharp jerk, and heard the coachman calling out to his horses, who were {{plunging}} furiously. Mr. Marx and <b>I</b> both <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> and, just as we did so, {{there was a tremendous}} crash of breaking glass, and, through the splintered carriage window, on the side nearest to him, came a heavy piece of rock, followed by a confused mass of stones and gravel and other débris.|$|R
60|$|As {{he picked}} out the needle, <b>I</b> saw Hilda <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> again, alert and watchful, eyeing him with a {{piercing}} glance; but, after a second's consideration, she seemed to satisfy herself, and fell back without a word. I gathered that {{she was ready to}} interfere, had occasion demanded. But occasion did not demand; and she held her peace quietly.|$|R
60|$|But he was {{not after}} the coots. <b>I</b> saw him <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> {{suddenly}} and plunge a foot into the water. Then, when he hopped back from the edge, {{and appeared to be}} eating something, it dawned upon me that he was fishing--and fishing like a true sportsman, out on the ice alone, with only his own skill to depend upon. In a few minutes he struck again, and this time rose with a fine fish, which he carried to the shore to devour at leisure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, surely not, {{my little}} wifie! And then you {{remember}} that, as {{you told me}} how truly you would love me, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to your lips, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to my desk, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> with my {{elbows on the}} table, the finger-tips of one hand in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> now, scarce {{daring to}} draw breath lest I should lose {{a word of}} what was to follow. The blood that had earlier surged to my face had now all receded again, and my pulses throbbed like hammers.|$|E
60|$|While {{the members}} of the group were, in turn, assuring me of this, a small bell on the table was taken up and rung, and the table itself was shoved powerfully toward the circle and away from the psychic. I assure you, my sitters were profoundly {{interested}} now, and some of the women were startled. A sharp, pecking sound came upon the cone. I called {{attention to the fact that}} this took place at least six feet from the psychic, and a moment later, with intent to detect her in any movement, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>forward</b> so that my head came close to her breast. I could not discern the slightest motion; I could not even hear her breathe. All this, while very impressive to me, was referred by the others to trickery on Mrs. Smiley's part.|$|R
6000|$|What I {{love to do}} is to walk up {{and down}} among them and catch the little scraps of conversation. The other day <b>I</b> heard one <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> and say, [...] "Well, I offered him {{a million and a half}} and said I wouldn't give a cent more, he could either take it or leave it--" [...] I just longed to break in and say, [...] "What! what! a million and a half! Oh! say that again! Offer it to me, to either take it or leave it. Do try me once: I know I can: or here, make it a plain million and let's call it done." ...|$|R
40|$|Motorcycling postures are generically speculated to be {{physical}} and physiologically demanding – which in-turn {{may lead to}} motorcycling fatigue, and then becoming a possible factor to road accident. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the muscular activities of various motorcycling postures. High muscular activity reading will signifies that motorcycling is indeed physically and physiologically demanding to the motorcyclist. For this particular study, the following postures were tested: <b>i)</b> <b>forward</b> <b>lean,</b> ii) upright sitting, and iii) neutral sitting (as control). Surface electromyography (sEMG) measurement was conducted on the following muscles: i) extensor carpi radialis, ii) upper trapezius iii) latissimus dorsi, and iv) erector spinae. The results showed that for all test subjects, the muscular activities readings for the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> posture was actually close to neutral sitting’s. Whilst, the upright sitting had showed much higher muscular activities measurement instead. Conclusively, this study had proven that any types of discomforts associated with the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> posture is not originated from muscular activities. Whereas, confirming that any discomforts in regards to the upright sitting is indeed related to muscular activities. Further studies are warranted to discover the actual risk factors that causes {{physical and}} physiological discomforts for the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> motorcycling posture...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and called}} Kendricks's {{attention}} to the nuns, and to the admirable literary quality of the whole situation. He was talking to Miss Gage, and he said as impatiently as he ever suffered himself to speak, [...] "Yes, yes; tremendously picturesque." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But isn't {{that all}} choice, Mrs Monnerie?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to ask. [...] "And aren't some people {{what one might}} call conspicuous, simply because they are really and truly, as it were, {{superior}} to other people? I don't mean better--just superior." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and looked}} into his face as {{steadily}} as I could. He dropped one hand upon the table and I grasped it by the wrist. It was twisted like a bird's claw, and upon the back was a ragged, red, diamond-shaped scar.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you say, that shrimp," [...] {{returned}} my lord; [...] "although {{really it}} is scarce a fitting {{mode of expression}} {{for one of the}} senators of the College of Justice. We were hearing the parties in a long, crucial case, before the fifteenth; Creech was moving at some length for an infeftment; when <b>I</b> saw Glenkindie <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> to Hermiston with his hand over his mouth and make him a secret communication. No one could have guessed its nature from your father; from Glenkindie, yes, his malice sparked out of him a little grossly. But your father, no. A man of granite. The next moment he pounced upon Creech. 'Mr. Creech,' says he, 'I'll take a look of that sasine,' and for thirty minutes after," [...] said Glenalmond, with a smile, [...] "Messrs. Creech and Co. were fighting a pretty uphill battle, which resulted, I need hardly add, in their total rout. The case was dismissed. No, I doubt if ever I heard Hermiston better inspired. He was literally rejoicing in apicibus juris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For here, amid these savage solitudes, I also am grown savage. The [...] old primeval {{passions of}} love and hate stir within me, and they are [...] fierce and cruel and strong, beyond what you men of the later ages [...] could understand. The culture of the centuries has fallen from me as [...] a flimsy garment whirled away by the {{mountain}} wind; the old savage [...] instincts of the race lie bare. One day I shall twine my fingers [...] about her full white throat, and her eyes will slowly come towards me, [...] and her lips will part, and the red tongue creep out; and backwards, [...] step by step, I shall push her before me, gazing the while upon her [...] bloodless face, {{and it will be}} my turn to smile. Backwards through [...] the open door, backwards along the garden path between the juniper [...] bushes, backwards till her heels are overhanging the ravine, and she [...] grips life with nothing but her little toes, I shall force her, step [...] by step, before me. Then <b>I</b> shall <b>lean</b> <b>forward,</b> closer, closer, till I [...] kiss her purpling lips, and down, down, down, past the startled sea- [...] birds, past the white spray of the foss, past the downward peeping [...] pines, down, down, down, we will go together, till we find the thing [...] that lies sleeping beneath the waters of the fiord." ...|$|R
60|$|Thomas Rooper now <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{with his}} elbows on his knees without smoking, and Asaph Scantle <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> with {{his elbows on}} his knees without smoking. And thus they remained, saying nothing to each other, for the space of some ten minutes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and watched}} de Cartienne's face intently. There was an {{expression}} in it which I could not analyse. It might have been pleasure, or apprehension, or indifference. Though I watched him narrowly, I could not {{make up my mind}} whether he was more dismayed or gratified at the prospect of our visit.|$|E
6000|$|The punkah-coolies {{had gone}} to sleep. Two {{kerosene}} lamps were blazing in the office, and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the blotter as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward.</b> Carnehan was shivering, and I feared that his mind might go. I wiped my face, took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands, and said:--"What happened after that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe who, {{notwithstanding}} his wife's temporary absence in the country, had {{not been}} in the best of spirits for several days, during the course of our tête-à-tête dinner at Luigi's became suddenly and unexpectedly animated. The change in him was so noticeable that <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> in my place to see what could have produced it.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> in my chair, {{and looked}} curiously into Allan's face. His hard, {{somewhat}} commonplace features seemed touched {{for the moment}} by some transfiguring fire. His keen, blue-grey eyes were as soft and luminous as a girl's. He had actually {{the appearance of a}} man who sees a little way beyond the border. Even then I could not take him seriously.|$|E
60|$|I was mad, I know--quite mad. Her {{words had}} made me so. And when, to ask me that insistent question, she brought her face still nearer, I flung down the reins of my unreason and let it ride amain upon its desperate, {{reckless}} course. In short, I too leaned forward, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> and I kissed her full upon those scarlet, parted lips.|$|E
