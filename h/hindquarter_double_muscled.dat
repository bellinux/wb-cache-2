40|$|When {{compared}} to animals of the dual purpose {{type in the}} same breed, Belgian Blue <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> bulls exhibit, at least, similar average daily gain with lower feed intake. The higher feed efficiency in the <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> type is mainly explained by {{the composition of the}} weight gains, the muscle content is minimum 60 kg higher and the fat content 30 kg lower than in the dual purpose type when slaughtered at a similar liveweight. In both types, the dressing percentage and the lean meat proportion in the carcass increase with final liveweight. The chemical composition and the sensory characteristics of meat are also influenced by <b>double</b> <b>muscling.</b> The fat content is reduced and the polyunsaturated fatty acids proportion is increased in the <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> type, resulting in a nutritional advantage. The difference in sensory characteristics could be, only partially, explained by the faster post mortem pH drop. The paler meat is mainly related to the myoglobin content. The advantage of the <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> type in terms of tenderness, due to a low collagen content, is not exhibited in a "choice" cut of the carcass with a low level of collagen. Finally, according to most of the available data, the water holding capacity of meat of <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> animals seems not very different.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>muscling</b> is a {{partially}} recessive trait present in some beef breeds. It shows a high frequency in some breeds, while in others the frequency is low, and double-muscled individuals are rare. The <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> {{is caused by}} an allelic series of mutations that cause a loss of function of the myostatin gene (GDF 8). We describe here a new mutation in the myostatin gene in Marchigiana breed, a typical beef breed of Central Italy, in which rare double-muscling individuals have been described. A PCR product of the third exon was sequenced in subjects phenotypically showing <b>double</b> <b>muscling,</b> and a C > T transversion was discovered that introduces a premature stop codon. The variant found adds to the large series of mutations present in cattle, and particularly to the only two causative of <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> in the third exon. A PCR-RFLP test is described for the rapid and effective identification of both heterozygous and homozygous subjects. It was applied to a larger survey carried on the same and also in two other beef breeds, Chianina and Romagnola. Further individuals carrying the new variant were found in Marchigiana, but none in the other breeds. The results may be important for a better comprehension {{of the role of}} myostatin in muscular development, for commercial use and for the inference of phylogeny of this gene.

Studies of double-muscled cattle identified natural mutations of the myostatin gene which produce inactivated proteins that are unable to control muscle development. In Belgian Blue and Piedmontese cattle this causes an increase in muscle mass of 20–25%. Subsequent studies identified a less extreme myostatin mutation known as F94L associated with Limousins. The resulting partially active protein results in Limousins having intermediate muscle development, which avoids the extreme muscling and associated disadvantages of <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> cattle.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenotype}} {{known as}} <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> and occurring in cattle, renders breeds affected {{such as the}} Belgian Blue and Peidmontese breeds virtually cost-ineffective due to dystocia (difficult calving). Here we describe a simple PCR-based method for determining allelic heterogeneity for the common mutant allele {{that is based on}} an 11 base-pair deletion, giving rise to <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> in the Belgian Blue breed. A set of two PCR primer pairs overlapping the deletion were designed. One pair of the set incorporated the 11 bases of the deletion site into the downstream primer, thus allowing the amplification of the wild (+ 11 bp) allele. The primer pairs were tested on a panel of Belgian Blue and crossbred cattle that were shown to be homozygous for the wild and mutant allele as well as heterozygous crossbred containing both alleles. The use of this type of method has the potential to revolutionise the breeding industry for <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> animals, by drawing the breeders of these animals back into the cost-effective markets.

40|$|End of Project ReportSummary There {{is general}} {{agreement}} across {{countries on the}} ranking of beef breeds for production and carcass traits. Differences between dairy and early maturing beef breeds in growth and slaughter traits are small, but the latter have lower feed intake and better carcass conformation. Late maturing beef breeds also have lower feed intake and better carcass conformation and in addition, have a higher growth rate, kill-out proportion and carcass muscle proportion. When factors such as age and fatness are accounted for, differences between breeds in meat quality traits are small. Differences amongst breed types in kill-out proportion {{can be explained by}} differences in gut contents (consequent on differences in feed intake), differences in the proportions of gastrointestinal tract and metabolic organs, differences in hide proportion, and differences in offal fats. Growth is an allometric, rather than an isometric, process. Some parts, organs and tissues grow relatively more slowly than the animal overall, and so become decreasing proportions over time, while others grow relatively faster and become increasing proportions. With increasing slaughter weight, the proportions of non carcass parts, hind quarter, bone, total muscle and higher value muscle decrease, while the proportions of non carcass and carcass fats, fore quarter and marbling fat all increase. Because of heterosis or hybrid vigour, the productivity of cross-bred cattle is superior to the mean of the parent breeds. While calving difficulty may be slightly higher (probably due to greater birth weight), calf mortality is much reduced in cross-breds. In addition, general robustness and growth rate are increased. There are additive effects of heterosis in the dam and the progeny. When cross-bred cows are mated to a bull of a third breed, > 60 % of total heterosis is attributable to the cross-bred cows. The <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> phenotype in beef cattle is due to the inactivated myostatin gene, but the inactivating mutation is not the same in all breeds and other genes also contribute to muscling. Compared to normal animals, <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> animals have lower proportions of digestive tract, internal fats and metabolic organs. This explains their superior kill-out proportion. They also have a smaller hind shin that helps accentuate the muscling in the remainder of the 4 limb. There are similar degrees of muscular hypertrophy in both the hind and fore quarters. Muscle to bone ratio is about one third greater in <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> than in normal carcasses. Piedmontese cattle with none, one or two mutated myostatin alleles were compared with normal Herefords and Limousins. In the absence of any mutated allele, Piedmontese were similar to Herefords, with one mutated allele they were similar to Limousins and with two mutated alleles they were immensely superior to Limousins. In fact, the response to the second mutated allele was about three times that to the first. If progeny approximated to the mean of the parent breeds, crossing a <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> sire with a dairy or early maturing beef cow would result in cattle of similar characteristics to pure-bred late maturing beef breeds. This does not happen because <b>double</b> <b>muscling</b> is dependent on a homozygous myostatin genotype. The progeny of a common cow breed and normal late maturing, or <b>double</b> <b>muscled,</b> sire breeds have similar production traits...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: One of the {{techniques}} used for treating facial paralysis is <b>double</b> <b>muscle</b> innervation using end-to-end neurorrhaphy with sectioning of healthy nerves. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether <b>double</b> <b>muscle</b> innervation by means of end-to-side neurorrhaphy could occur, with maintenance of muscle innervation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Experimental study developed at the Experimental Research Center, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, Unesp. METHODS: One hundred rats were allocated to five groups as follows: G 1, control group; G 2, the peroneal nerve was sectioned; G 3, the tibial nerve was transected and the proximal stump was end-to-side sutured to the intact peroneal nerve; G 4, 120 days after the G 3 surgery, the peroneal nerve was sectioned proximally to the neurorrhaphy; G 5, 120 days after the G 3 surgery, the peroneal and tibial nerves were sectioned proximally to the neurorrhaphy. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty days after the surgery, G 3 did not show any change in tibial muscle weight or muscle fiber diameter, but the axonal fiber diameter in the peroneal nerve distal to the neurorrhaphy had decreased. Although G 4 showed atrophy of the cranial tibial muscle 30 days after sectioning the peroneal nerve, the electrophysiological test results and axonal diameter measurement confirmed that muscle reinnervation had occurred. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <b>double</b> <b>muscle</b> innervation did not occur through end-to-side neurorrhaphy; the tibial nerve was not able to maintain muscle innervation after the peroneal nerve had been sectioned, although muscle reinnervation was found to have occurred, 30 days after the peroneal nerve had been sectioned...|$|R

Despite a remarkably high degree of conservation with the mammalian protein, the function of myostatin remains unknown in fish, many species of which continue muscle growth throughout the lifecycle by hyperplasia. Transgenic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) overexpressing follistatin, one of the more efficacious antagonists of myostatin, were produced to investigate the effect of this protein on muscle development and growth. P 1 transgenics overexpressing follistatin in muscle tissue exhibited increased epaxial and hypaxial muscling similar to that observed in <b>double</b> <b>muscled</b> cattle and myostatin null mice. The hypaxial muscling generated a phenotype reminiscent of well developed rectus abdominus and intercostal muscles in humans and was dubbed “six-pack”. Body conformation of the transgenic animals was markedly altered, as measured by condition factor, and total muscle surface area increased. The increased muscling was due almost exclusively to hyperplasia as evidenced by a higher number of fibers per unit area and increases in the percentage of smaller fibers and the number of total fibers. In several individuals asymmetrical muscling was observed but no changes in mobility or behavior of follistatin fish were observed. The findings indicate that overexpression of follistatin in trout, a species with indeterminate growth rate, enhances muscle growth.
