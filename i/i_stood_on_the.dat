All sang chorus! <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage and conducted the encore – funny sight!" [...] With characteristic grace, the composer wrote to Kipling, [...] "Your splendid words went with a swing and enthusiasm which even my music cannot stifle". Kipling, {{on the other}} hand, described the music as [...] "a tune guaranteed to pull teeth out of barrel-organs".|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} probably {{originated in}} the 13thcentury. [...] During the later part of the 16thcentury the tower was leased to two city guilds, the Painters and Stationers, and the Barbers and Chandlers, who sublet it to other guilds. [...] By 1612 {{the fabric of the}} tower was in a poor condition, and the lead had been lost from its roof. [...] It was restored by the two guilds, and above the door they placed a plaque containing the date 1613 and a carving of a phoenix, the emblem of the Painters. [...] In the Civil War, during the Siege of Chester in 1645, the tower had a gun in each storey, and it was damaged in the conflict. [...] A plaque on the tower states that King Charles <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower on 24September 1645 as he watched his soldiers being defeated at the Battle of Rowton Heath. The historian Simon Ward has expressed doubts about this and has suggested that the king may have stood instead on a tower of Chester Cathedral, which he considers is confirmed by evidence that a captain standing beside him was killed by a stray shot.|$|E

Thou hast come to my father's house, as well as I can guess, a fugitive and an exile, and thy first greeting to its inhabitants has been that of contempt and injury. By what means I {{have been able to}} retort that contempt, let thine own conscience tell thee.

2500|$|Lancaster Castle, partly {{built in}} the 13th century and {{enlarged}} by Elizabeth <b>I,</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of a Roman garrison.

Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests.
