5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E

5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge {{on the deck}} of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E

Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.|$|E

5|$|The Elections and Transitions Committee {{arranged}} for the Whittemore Center {{to be used for}} the consecration, a large hockey rink {{on the campus of the}} University of New Hampshire in Durham. The numbers expected were about 3,000 people, 300 press, a 200 strong choir, and 48 bishops. The security was strong: just as Barbara Harris <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a bullet-proof vest at her consecration, Robinson was showing his bullet-proof vest to Harris herself. Robinson's parents, sister, daughter and their families and his ex-wife Boo were all at the consecration. Robinson was consecrated on November 2, 2003, in the presence of Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop, and six co-consecrating bishops: 48 bishops in all.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E

In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, {{who claimed to be}} Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E

5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|In December1941, {{just before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to Iowa City, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) Flying Cadet program with a recruiter. On January 17 of the {{following}} year, {{he was sent to}} Fort Des Moines and soon inducted into the USAAF. Not long after, he and other new inductees went to Minter Field in Bakersfield, California for more physical examinations, and then they went north to Visalia for primary training in January23. The class (which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> coveralls {{due to the lack of}} standard uniforms) first trained in Ryan PT-22 Recruits before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in BT-13 Valiants. Along with his brother Robert, who had also enlisted, Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training. Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to Luke Field near Phoenix, Arizona for advanced flight training in the North American AT-6. On July 26, 1942, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and received his wings from Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead.|$|E

5|$|On April 18, 2005, {{the crew}} began {{shooting}} at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected {{as he felt}} it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for. However, this was also a problem; the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production, as while the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
