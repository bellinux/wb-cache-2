40|$|What can the new {{federalism}} {{teach us}} {{about what is happening}} in immigration law? The changing relationship of federal-state government in the regulation of immigrants has {{led to the creation of}} “immigration federalism” as a field of scholarship. Most of this scholarly attention has been directed at resisting restrictionist legislation that encourages vigorous law enforcement against undocumented immigrants. The scholarly tilt is especially pronounced since the Supreme Court recently struck down several provisions of S. B. 1070, Arizona’s restrictive law enforcement legislation. However, law enforcement is only one type of regulation, and the overwhelming focus on it skews the broader debate about the proper place of states in regulating immigrants. According to recent statistics, restrictionist state law is on the decline and, as of mid- 2013, there has been an increase in <b>inclusionary</b> <b>state</b> laws. In light of this shifting landscape, this Essay attempts to advance the discussion beyond the normative dimension of immigration federalism — whether states should be involved in the enterprise — to consider how states can be involved...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that while state rhetoric may be inclusionary, {{policies}} and practices may be exclusionary. This can imply that the power to include rests only with the state. In some ways, the implication is valid in respect of Aboriginal Australians. For instance, the Australian state has gained control of Aboriginal inclusion via a singular, bounded category and Aboriginal ideal type. However, the implication is also limited in their respect. Aborigines are abject but also agents in {{their relationship with the}} wider society. Their politics contributes to the construction of the very category and type that governs them, and presses individuals to resist <b>state</b> <b>inclusionary</b> efforts. Aboriginal political elites police the performance of an Aboriginality dominated by notions of difference and resistance. The combined processes of governance act to deny Aborigines the potential of being both Aboriginal and Australian, being different and belonging. They maintain Aborigines' marginality...|$|R
40|$|This article unravels China’s {{united front}} work {{in dealing with}} civil society, using the case of Hong Kong after the {{political}} handover since 1997. While it has been widely analyzed by scholars that state corporatism characterizes the state-society relations in China, including the state’s relations with its autonomous regions, Hong Kong as a special administrative region, however, shows that the ruling strategies of China are very adaptive. Comparing {{with the rest of}} China where the united front work is partly characterized by a heavy-handed policy of assimilation, the united front work in the post-handover Hong Kong illustrates a more <b>inclusionary</b> version of <b>state</b> corporatism through five types of measures, namely, integration, cooptation, collaboration, containment, and denunciation. The strategies range from soft to hard tactics, and are adopted depending upon whether the central government regards its targets as friends, valuable potential cooptees or enemies. Nevertheless, the soft and hard tactics used in parallel in Hong Kong have resulted in further politicization and polarization of the civil society, and transformed the tension {{between the state and the}} local groups into clashes between different local groups, as seen in other autonomous regions such as Tibet and Xinjiang. Over the years, the agents for state corporatism have been ever expanding in Hong Kong. The ideologies propagated have now gone beyond consensus and harmony to also include patriotism and reinterpre-tation of other political ideas, including universal suffrage, conducive to cultivating obedience. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{political}} struggles that followed after {{the appearance of}} irregular migrants in Sweden. The analysis starts from {{the assumption that the}} group’s precarious circumstances of living disrupted the understanding of Sweden as an inclusive society and shed light on the limits of the welfare <b>state’s</b> <b>inclusionary</b> ambitions. The overarching analytical point of entry is accordingly that the appearance of irregular migrants constitutes an opening for contestation of the demarcation of the welfare state. The analysis draws on two strands of theory to explore this opening. Citizenship theory, first, provides insights about the contradictory logics of the welfare state, i. e. the fact that it rests on norms of equality and inclusion {{at the same time as}} it is premised on a fundamental exclusion of non-members. Discourse theory, furthermore, is brought in to make sense of the potential for contestation. The study approaches these struggles over demarcation through an analysis of the debates and claims-making that took place in the Swedish parliament between 1999 and 2014. The focal point of the analysis is the efforts to make sense of and respond to the predicament of the group. The study shows that efforts to secure rights and inclusion for the group revolved around two demands. The first demand, regularisation, aimed to secure rights for irregular migrants through status, i. e. through the granting of residence permits, whereas the second demand, access to social rights, aimed to secure rights through turning the group into right-bearers in the welfare state. The thesis concludes that the debates and claims-making during the 2000 s resulted in a small, but significant, shift in policy. In 2013, new legislation was adopted that granted irregular migrants access to schooling and health- and medical care. I argue that this was an effect of successful campaigning that managed to establish these particular rights as human rights, and as such, rights that should be provided to all residents regardless of legal status. Overall, however, I conclude that there has been an absence of more radical contestation of the citizenship order, and of accompanying notions of rights and entitlement, in the debates studied...|$|R
