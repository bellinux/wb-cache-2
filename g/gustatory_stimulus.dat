It {{has been reported that}} electrical stimulation of the lingual nerve, chorda tympani, and a lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve elicit evoked field potential in the frontal operculum. Electrical stimulation of the insula in the human elicit gustatory sensations. Gustatory information is conveyed to the orbitofrontal cortex, the secondary gustatory cortex from the AI/FO. Studies have shown that 8% of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to taste stimuli, and a part of these neurons are finely tuned to particular taste stimuli. It has also been shown in monkeys that the responses of orbitofrontal neurons to taste decreased when the monkey eats to satiety. [...] Furthermore neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to the visual,and/or olfactory stimuli in addition to the <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus.</b> These results suggest that gustatory neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex may {{play an important role in}} food identification and selection. A patient study reported that damage in the rostral part of the insula caused gustatory disturbance, as well as taste recognition and intensity deficits in patients with insular cortex lesions. [...] It has also been reported that a patient who had an epileptic focus in the frontal operculum and epileptic activity in the focus produced a disagreeable taste. Activation in the insula also takes place when exposed to gustatory imagery. Studies compared the activated regions in subjects shown food pictures to those shown location pictures and found that food pictures activated the right insula/operculum and the left orbitofrontal cortex.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} {{examined}} short-term recognition for <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> (wines) and investigated {{the proposition that}} serial position effects are qualitatively equivalent across stimulus types (Ward et al., 2005). Design: Two experiments examined serial position effects for a single yes/no recognition task with gustatory (Experiment 1) and visual stimuli (Experiment 2). Methods: Two experiments were conducted (n= 24 in each) each comprising 18 trials. Participants were presented with sequences of three wines (Experiment 1) or three matrices (Experiment 2). Each item was presented for five seconds with a five-second ISI (incorporating a palette cleanse). Following the three items, participants received a single recognition probe. Results: Recognition for wine revealed strong primacy with an indication of recency. In contrast, recognition for non-verbal stimuli (abstract matrices) revealed strong recency and no primacy. Conclusions: The primacy advantage reported for wines {{is consistent with the}} first item bias reported for wine preference judgments (Mantonakis et al., 2009).

We describe here the types and distribution of antennal sensilla in Cotesia plutellae, a larval parasitoid of Plutella xylostella, and we analyze its oviposition behavior. Seven types of sensilla were found on both males and females. Only sensilla trichodea type II, with a putative contact chemoreceptive function, was significantly more abundant in females than in males, and its morphology and position on antennomeres were linked to the antennation behavior used by females during host search. We conclude that <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> following antennal contact is probably the key stimulus inducing oviposition behavior.

PHYSIOL BEHAV 42 (3) 223 - 229. 1988. [...] (1) In order {{to determine whether the}} responsiveness of neurons in the insular gustatory cortex is influenced by hunger, neuronal activity was analysed in it while macaque monkeys (Maeaca jhscicularis) were fed to satiety. The responses of single neurons in the insular gustatory cortex to the protypical taste stimuli glucose, NaCI, HCI and quinine HCI, and to fruit juice, were measured before, while, and after the monkey was fed to satiety with glucose or fruit juice. (2) While behavior turned from avid acceptance to active rejection upon repletion, the responsiveness of the neurons to the stimulus array, including the satiating solution, was unmodified. (3) It is concluded that in the insular gustatory cortex, neuronal responses to <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> are not influenced by the normal transition from hunger to satiety. This is in contrast to the responses of a population of neurons recorded in the hypothalamus, which only respond to the taste of food when the monkey is hungry.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adult rats {{exhibit a}} {{decrease}} in consummatory responses following repeated presentations of a taste (habituation) {{and an increase in}} consummatory responses if they experience an upward shift in the magnitude or intensity of a <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> (e. g., sucrose or saccharin). These responses do not represent a direct sensorimotor reaction to a gustatory cue, but rather reflect a change in responding based on the memory of a previous taste. Here, we sought to determine if fetal rats could (like adults) adjust their orofacial motor responses based on a memory of recent gustatory experience. Embryonic Day 18 (E 18) or Day 19 (E 19) rat fetuses received oral lavage with either 0. 15 or 0. 30 % saccharin (SAC). Subsequently, observations of orofacial movements (mouthing and licking) following oral lavage with 0. 30 % SAC were made 50 min later, 24 hr later, or on postnatal Day 3 (P 3). Thus, some animals were in a ‘‘shifted’ ’ condition in which they first experienced a relatively low concentration of SAC and then a higher one while control rats (‘‘nonshifted’’) received 0. 30 % SAC during both taste exposures.

The study analyzed whether and to what extend a conditioned placebo response is affecting type I allergic reactions and whether this response can be reproduced at multiple occasions. Methods: 62 patients with house dust mite allergy were randomly allocated to either a conditioned (n = 25), sham-conditioned (n = 25) or natural history (n = 12) group. During the learning phase (acquisition), patients in the conditioned group received the H 1 -receptor antagonist desloratadine (5 mg) (unconditioned stimulus/US) together with a novel tasting <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> (conditioned stimulus/CS). Patients in the sham-conditioned control group received the CS together with a placebo pill. After a wash out time of 9 days patients in the conditioned and sham-conditioned group received placebo pills together with the CS during evocation.

40|$|Orthonasal and retronasal {{olfaction}} processes differ. The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether congruent and incongruent simultaneous <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> influence orthonasal and retronasal odorant perception, using olfactory event-related potentials as a measure. Thirty-two young, healthy subjects (16 men, 16 women) took part in two test sessions. Olfactory event-related potentials were recorded in response to a food-like odor, vanillin, and to an odor usually not associated with foods, the rose-like phenylethylalcohol. Each session consisted of four randomized blocks of 15 stimuli each which were applied either orthonasally or retronasally. Simultaneously, sweet or sour <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> were applied. In response to retronasal vanillin, stimuli latencies P 2 of the event-related potentials were significantly shorter in the congruent "sweet condition" than the incongruent "sour condition". In contrast, with orthonasal stimulation, shorter P 2 latencies were seen for both odorants in the incongruent condition. Intensity of both odorants was perceived as less pronounced after retronasal stimulation than after orthonasal stimulation. In conclusion, application of a sweet taste significantly enhanced the processing of a congruent olfactory stimulus when presented through the retronasal route. Incongruent simultaneous gustatory stimulation applied during orthonasal olfaction seemed to induce conflict priming, also resulting in faster processing...|$|R

It was therefore the aim of present study to examine whether retronasal olfaction, in combination with simultaneous <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> influences swallowing in a manner {{different from that of}} orthonasal olfaction. Fifty normosmic and normogeusic subjects took part in the study.

40|$|Oral {{referral}} {{is central}} to multisensory flavour perception. The phenomenon, first described {{a little over a}} century ago, is characterized by the mislocalization of food-related olfactory stimuli to the oral cavity. Many researchers believe that it contributes to the widespread confusion concerning which sense really provides the information that is bound together in flavour percepts. In this review, evidence supporting the role of a number of factors that have been suggested to modulate oral referral, including tactile capture of olfaction, the relative timing of olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and <b>gustatory</b> capture (possibly involving prior entry) is critically evaluated. The latest findings now support the view that the oral referral of orthonasal aroma (what some have chosen to call orthonasal location binding) is modulated by taste intensity, while for retronasal odours, it is the congruency between the odour-taste(s) pairing that is key. Specifically, the more congruent a particular combination of olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> the more likely the component unisensory stimuli will be bound together as a flavour object (or Gestalt) and, as a result, localized together to the oral cavity. The possible roles of attention, attentional capture, and the nutritional significance of the taste in the phenomenon of oral referral are also reviewed. Ultimately, the suggestion is made that oral referral may reflect a qualitatively different kind of multisensory interaction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{detection}} of novel stimuli is a memory-dependent process. The presented stimulus {{has to be}} compared with memory contents to judge its novelty. In addition, the novelty of stimuli activates attention-related processes that facilitate memory formation. To determine the involvement of limbic and neocortical brain structures in novelty detection, we exposed mice to a novel <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> (0. 5 % saccharin) added to their drinking fluid. We then compared the noveltyinduced expression of the two immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-fos and arg 3. 1, with their expression in mice familiarized with the same stimulus or mice not exposed to that stimulus. Exposure to taste novelty increased expression of c-fos and arg 3. 1 mRNA in the cingulate cortex and deep layers of the parietal cortex. In addition, c-fos mRNA expression was increased in the amygdala and arg 3. 1 mRNA was increased in the dentate gyrus. Expression of c-fos and arg 3. 1 was elevated 30 min after the exposure to novelty. For arg 3. 1, a second peak of expression was found 4. 5 h after presentation of the novel stimulus. Our {{results indicate that the}} amygdala, the dentate gyrus, and the cingulate and parietal cortices may be involved in novelty detection and associated cognitive events, and suggest that c-fos and arg 3. 1 play distinct roles in these processes. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons...|$|E
40|$|The landing {{response}} of the large cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae was studied under controlled optical and <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> conditions. Experience-based changes in landing behaviour were examined by offering cardboard circles of two different shades of green, treated with either an oviposition stimulant or a deterrent. We employed two training situations. In one situation the two shades of green, carrying either the stimulant or the deterrent, were offered simultaneously, in the other sequentially. During the 1 hour training periods, butterflies were either landing and drumming spontaneously or they were caught {{at the end of}} the period and placed on the artificial leaves until tarsal drumming ensued. Our experiments demonstrated that P. brassicae females can learn to associate visually detected substrate characteristics with contact-chemosensory information available only after landing. Furthermore, a learned preference for a substrate could be turned into a preference for the alternative substrate by exposing the insect to a deterrent on the previously preferred substrate. These results provide indications of aversion learning, thus far undocumented in oviposition behaviour of Lepidoptera. Bringing the butterflies into forced contact with the oviposition stimulant resulted in similar effects on landing preference compared to those of spontaneous landing, but spontaneous landing had a stronger effect on preference for associations involving the deterrent. The simultaneous training regime, which supposedly requires a less important role for short-term memory, was more effective in modifying landing preference...|$|E
40|$|The {{neuronal}} network controlling {{feeding behavior}} in the CNS of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis has been extensively investigated using intracellular microelectrodes. Using microelectrodes however {{it has not been}} possible to record from large numbers of neurons simultaneously and therefore {{little is known about the}} population coding properties of the feeding network. Neither can the relationships between feeding and neuronal networks controlling other behaviors be easily analyzed with microelectrodes. Here we describe a multielectrode array (MEA) technique for recording action potentials simultaneously from up to 60 electrodes on the intact CNS. The preparation consists of the whole CNS connected by sensory nerves to the chemosensory epithelia of the lip and esophagus. From the buccal ganglia, the region of the CNS containing the feeding central pattern generator (CPG), a rhythmic pattern of activity characteristic of feeding was readily induced either by depolarizing an identified feeding-command neuron (the CV 1 a) or by perfusing the chemosensory epithelia with sucrose, a <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> known to activate feeding. Activity induced by sucrose is not restricted to the buccal ganglia but is distributed widely throughout the CNS, notably in ganglia controlling locomotion, a behavior that must be coordinated with feeding. The MEA also enabled us to record electrophysiological consequences of the associative conditioning of feeding behavior. The results suggest that MEA recording from an intact CNS enables distributed, multiple-source neural activity to be analyzed in the context of biologically relevant behavior, behavioral coordination and behavioral plasticity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} exposure to sensory stimuli, {{with or without}} reward is well known to induce stimulus-specific modifications of behaviour, described as different forms of learning. In recent studies we showed that a brief single pre-exposure to the female-produced sex pheromone or even a predator sound can increase the behavioural and central nervous responses to this pheromone in males of the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis. To investigate if this increase in sensitivity might be restricted to the pheromone system or {{is a form of}} general sensitization, we studied here if a brief pre-exposure to stimuli of different modalities can reciprocally change behavioural and physiological responses to olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> pre-exposure and subsequent behavioural tests were carried out to reveal possible intra- and cross-modal effects. Attraction to pheromone, monitored with a locomotion compensator, increased after exposure to olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Behavioural responses to sucrose, investigated using the proboscis extension reflex, increased equally after pre-exposure to olfactory and gustatory cues. Pheromone-specific neurons in the brain and antennal gustatory neurons did, however, not change their sensitivity after sucrose exposure. The observed intra- and reciprocal cross-modal effects of pre-exposure may represent a new form of stimulus-nonspecific general sensitization originating from modifications at higher sensory processing levels. © 2012 Minoli et al.

In male noctuid moths, Spodoptera littoralis, brief pre-exposure to various behaviourally relevant sensory signals modifies subsequent behaviour towards the same or different sensory modalities. Correlated with a behavioural increase in responses of male moths to the female-emitted sex pheromone after pre-exposure to olfactory, acoustic or <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> an increase in sensitivity of olfactory neurons within the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe, is found for olfactory and acoustic stimuli, but not for <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Here, we investigated whether anatomical changes occurring in the antennal lobes and in the mushroom bodies (the secondary olfactory centres) possibly correlated with the changes observed in behaviour and in olfactory neuron physiology. Our results showed that significant volume changes occurred in glomeruli (olfactory units) responsive to sex pheromone following exposure to both pheromone and predator sounds. The volume of the mushroom body input region (calyx) also increased significantly after pheromone and predator sound treatment. However, we found no changes in the volume of antennal lobe glomeruli or of the mushroom body calyx after pre-exposure to sucrose. These findings show a relationship of antennal lobe sensitivity changes to the pheromone with changes in {{the volume of the}} related glomeruli and the output area of antennal lobe projection neurons elicited by sensory cues causing a behavioural change. Behavioural changes observed after sucrose pre-exposure must originate from changes in higher integration centres in the brain. </p...|$|R

In the first series of experiments animals received bilateral injections of 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid prior to taste aversion conditioning or spatial training. A strong disruptive effect was found in the acquisition of training tasks. To determine the possible involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the early post-training processes taking place in the cortex during both learning paradigms, in a second series of experiments, animals received bilateral 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid microinjections 30, 60 or 120 min after the acquisition trial, and 15 min before the retention test. For spatial learning successive treatments were independently done either starting {{at the onset of the}} asymptotic phase of the learning curve, 0, 30 or 120 min after finishing the training session, as well as 15 min before the retention test trial. The conditioned taste aversion task remained sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate blockade during a period of at least 2 h after the first presentation of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> while in the case of the spatial learning task, a gradually decreasing effect was observed from the onset of the asymptotic phase onwards. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor involvement in cortical regulation of memory formation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the cross-modal Stroop effect between visually presented anagrams and gustatory stimuli. The working hypothesis states that cross-modal Stroop interference is increased by the level of inconsistency and reduced by the level of congruence between gustatory stimuli and linguistic visual stimuli whose order of syllables has been changed. 29 argentine subjects whose average age was 22 years old (SD = 3. 024 years) participated in the experiment. A within-subjects repeated measures design was used. The independent variable was determined as the congruence of the stimulus and in it three levels were identified: congruent, incongruent and control stimuli. Two dependent variables were determined: reaction time and number of correct responses. The chosen paradigm was the cross-modal Stroop task. Gustatory stimuli were administered together with anagrams. The task required identifying a <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> in the shortest possible time. It was concluded that in conditions of incongruent and control stimuli, subjects were not able to inhibit linguistic distractors to elaborate quick and effective responses concerning the identification of gustatory stimuli.

Here we present direct {{measures of the}} peripheral gustatory system activation, {{by means of a}} new, highly reliable and yet non-invasive technique for the electrophysiological recording from the human tongue in response to taste stimuli. Firstly, we validated the efficacy of method based on comparing the bioelectric activity recorded in response to the paradigmatic <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP), with parameters defining PROP genotype and phenotype of forty-three subjects. The main results were: 1) PROP stimulation evoked negative monophasic potentials characterized by a fast initial rise followed by a slow decline, which represent the measure of the summated voltage change resulting from the response of stimulated taste cells; 2) direct associations were found between parameters describing the waveform of signals (depolarization amplitude and depolarization rate) and TAS 2 R 38 genotype, fungiform papilla density and PROP phenotype of subjects. Secondly, we developed an automated learning approach capable of discriminating among subjects belonging to three PROP taster categories (super-tasters, medium taster and non-taster), by exploiting features extracted by electrophysiological recordings from the tongue of thirty-nine subjects. Results showed {{that it is possible to}} automatically achieve objective PROP taster status identification with a high accuracy (80 ± 18 %), which reaches 94 ± 15 % when only super-tasters and non-tasters are considered. Finally, preliminary results of the electrophysiological recording in response to sucrose, NaCl, citric acid, caffeine, umami and oleic acid showed the feasibility of the method also for other gustatory stimuli, thus providing a first proof of its general applicability. The proposed approach, representing the first objective and automatic method to directly measure human gustatory responses, may represent a milestone for physiology studies on taste, with applications ranging from basic science and medicine to food tasting evaluations...|$|E

Tactile stimuli were detected and localized by verbal report, whereas <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> were identified by pointing to the corresponding name on cards bearing the names of the three tastes. In the tactile test, 9 of 18 RBD patients showed extinction of left hemitongue stimuli, whereas the remaining RBD patients, 9 LBD patients and 14 healthy subjects detected virtually all stimuli in all conditions. In the gustatory test, healthy subjects outperformed the two brain damaged groups which nevertheless responded well above chance and did not differ from one another. Unexpectedly, the nine RBD {{patients with}} left hemitongue tactile extinction showed no gustatory extinction, since performance did not differ significantly between the two hemitongues on both unilateral and bilateral stimulations. To account for these findings, some evidence suggests that the tongue representation is bilateral in both modalities, but predominantly ipsilateral in the gustatory modality and predominantly contralateral in the tactile modality. The RBD patients with left hemitongue tactile extinction were those with more marked symptoms of left-sided extinction in the visual and auditory modalities, making it likely that their brain damage was also responsible for left lingual tactile extinction. The absence of left gustatory extinction in those patients {{can be attributed to the}} predominant channelling of left hemitongue taste inputs into the intact left hemisphere. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For appetitive conditioning in C. elegans, food has exclusively been used as an unconditioned stimulus (US). It {{may be difficult to}} analyze neuronal circuits for associative memory since food is a multimodal combination of olfactory, gustatory, and mechanical stimuli. Here, we report classical appetitive conditioning and associative memory in C. elegans, using 1 -nonanol as a conditioned stimulus (CS), and potassium chloride (KCl) as a US. Before conditioning, C. elegans innately avoided 1 -nonanol, an aversive olfactory stimulus, and was attracted by KCl, an appetitive <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> on assay agar plates. Both massed training without an intertrial interval (ITI) and spaced training with a 10 -min ITI induced significant levels of memory of association regarding the two chemicals. Memory induced by massed training decayed within 6 h, while that induced by spaced training was retained for more than 6 h. Animals treated with inhibitors of transcription or translation formed the memory induced by spaced training less efficiently than untreated animals, whereas the memory induced by massed training was not significantly affected by such treatments. By definition, therefore, memories induced by massed training and spaced training are classified as short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively. When animals conditioned by spaced training were exposed to 1 -nonanol alone, their learning index was lower than that of untreated animals, suggesting that extinction learning occurs in C. elegans. In support of these results, C. elegans mutants defective in nmr- 1, encoding an NMDA receptor subunit, formed both STM and LTM less efficiently than wild-type animals, while mutations in crh- 1, encoding a ubiquitous transcription factor CREB required for memory consolidation, affected LTM, but not STM. The paradigm established in the present study should allow us to elucidate neuronal circuit plasticity for appetitive learning and memory in C. elegans...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{two questions}} in the working memory field: the organization of working memory function within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) {{and the nature of}} the limited capacity of visual working memory. To study the organization of working memory function within the PFC, we recorded the activity of single neurons from different areas within the PFC and from the gustatory cortex (GUS) of two subjects while they performed a gustatory delayed-match-to-sample task with intervening gustatory distraction. Neurons that encoded the <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> across the delay, consistent with a role in gustatory working memory, were most prevalent in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (the main recipient of gustatory inputs within the PFC) and GUS compared with dorsolateral PFC and ventrolateral PFC. Gustatory information in OFC was more resilient to intervening distraction, paralleling previous findings regarding visual working memory processes in PFC and posterior sensory cortex. Our findings are consistent with a model of working memory organization in which different PFC areas encode different types of information in working memory depending on their afferent connections with different sensory brain areas. 	In the second part of this work, we investigate the nature of the limited capacity in visual working memory by training two subjects on a multiple-item color change detection task. Our results show that when subjects have to store multiple items in visual working memory, the fidelity of the memory traces decreases as more items are loaded into memory. Thus, visual working memory can be described as a limited resource that must be shared in the representation of multiple items. By recording activity from single neurons in the ventral PFC while subjects held multiple colors in memory, we show that for a subset of color-tuned neurons, the sharpness of tuning decreases when two items are being held in working memory. Thus the amount of information encoded by the neurons decreases as more items are loaded in memory, analogous to the loss in precision of the internal memory representations. This finding, however, only applies when we take into account which color the subjects were covertly attending to, suggesting that attention plays a significant role in the allocation of the limited memory resources...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to demonstrate the}} comparisons and contrasts of the conditional stimuli 2 ̆ 7 s (CS 2 ̆ 7 s) actions with those of morphine in morphine withdrawn rats. The study shows that specific stimuli altered behavioral and physiological withdrawal signs such as: hypothermia, shakes, ptosis, piloerection, writhing and aggression. Also, one stimulus was able to effect two biochemical measures (blood glucose and striatal homovanillic acid) similar to the action of morphine. Rats were given two equally spaced injections of morphine sulfate paired with different stimuli (bell, drug, oil of anise, saccharin). The stimuli were paired with an injection for 15 - 25 days. Twenty-four hours after the last morphine injection the appropriate stimulus was presented. The rats learned to increase their body temperature, reduce wet shakes, increase ptosis, reduce writhing and reduce aggressive responses following the presentation of oil of anise. The bell stimulus only increased temperature. The <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimulus</b> increased temperature and the drug stimuli {{had no effect on}} withdrawal signs. The changes observed were specific only to animals that had the respective stimuli paired with morphine prior to challenge treatment. The duration of the CS in the oil of anise study was important, the onset required a time period of greater than 2 min but no more than 30 min for the maximal effect. When naïve animals were exposed to the stimuli, no changes were observed either behaviorally or physiologically. Those animals receiving random CS or no CS during addiction demonstrated no change in observed withdrawal signs when presented the CS 24 hr or 48 hr after the last morphine injection. In the presence of naloxone, a pure narcotic antagonist, oil of anise-morphine paired animals receiving the CS, 24 hr after the last morphine-CS pairing exhibited no change in withdrawal signs which previously had been changed by the CS. This data implies, indirectly, the release of a morphine like substance in the production of the CS effects. In addition to the behavioral and physiological measure brought under stimulus control, two biochemical measures (blood glucose and striatal homovanillic acid) were specifically increased by the CS (oil of anise) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen by morphine alone, therefore showing that the conditional responses of morphine addiction are not just behavioral but also involve biochemical systems. These data indicate that the changes resulting from morphine presentation during withdrawal can be classically conditioned. The responses are of three types - behavioral, biochemical and physiological...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} gustatory {{physiology and}} associated dysfunctions {{it is important}} to know how oral taste stimuli are encoded both in the periphery and in taste-related brain centres. The identification of distinct taste receptors, together with electrophysiological recordings and behavioral assessments in response to taste stimuli, suggest that information about distinct taste modalities (e. g. sweet versus bitter) are transmitted from the periphery to the brain via segregated pathways. By contrast, gustatory neurons throughout the brain are more broadly tuned, indicating that ensembles of neurons encode taste qualities. Recent evidence reviewed here suggests that the coding of <b>gustatory</b> <b>stimuli</b> is not immutable, but is dependant on a variety of factors including appetite-regulating molecules and associative learning...|$|R
