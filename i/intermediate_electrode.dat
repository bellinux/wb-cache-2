In 2 O 3 :Sn (ITO) is {{the most widely used}} TCO in optoelectronic devices. As indium is scarce and ITO is limited in flexibility due to its ceramic structure, many studies have been dedicated to new transparent conductive electrodes. This review article presents the state-of-the-art concerning the dielectric/metal/dielectric structures and their application as transparent electrodes in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs). First, TCO/Ag/TCO structures were created to achieve higher conductivity than ITO films. Then others dielectrics have been used such as transition-metal oxides (WO 3, MoO 3, V 2 O 5, etc.), ZnS, etc. Such structures exhibit excellent flexibility, high conductivity, and good transparency. They can be deposited onto substrates at room temperature by simple evaporation under vacuum. Moreover, it is possible to manage the anode work function through the choice of the dielectric, which can allow them to be used as cathodes or anodes and as <b>intermediate</b> <b>electrodes</b> in tandem solar cells. The properties of the dielectric/metal/dielectric (D/M/D) structures depend on the thickness of the different layers. The threshold thickness value of the metal film is usually around 10 [*]nm, where the structures change from an insulating state to a highly conductive state. This is attributed to the percolation of conducting metal paths. The transmittance of the films increases when the metal thickness increases up to the percolation thickness, while further increase induces a decrease in transmittance.

Electrohydrodynamic thrusters generate thrust by using {{two or more}} electrodes to ionize the ambient fluid and create an electric field. In this thesis, electrohydrodynamic thrusters of single- and dual-stage configurations were tested. Single-stage thrusters refer to a geometry employing one emitter electrode, an air gap of length d, and a collector electrode with large radius of curvature relative to the emitter. Dual-stage thrusters add a collinear <b>intermediate</b> <b>electrode</b> in between the emitter and collector. Single-stage thruster performance was shown to exhibit trends {{in agreement with the}} one-dimensional theory under both positive and negative DC excitations. Increasing the gap length requires a higher voltage for thrust onset, generates less thrust per input voltage, generates more thrust per input current, and most importantly generates more thrust per input power. A thrust-to-power ratio as high as 68. 43 mN/W was obtained for a d = 21 cm thruster. Dual-stage thrusters were shown to be more effective than its single-stage counterpart of equal total gap length at producing current, leading to a smaller total voltage necessary for producing equal thrust. However, losses involving ion collection at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>electrode</b> led to reduced thrust-per-power compared to the single-stage of equal length. A factor was defined in order to characterize these losses, and the theoretical dependence of thrust-to-power on was experimentally confirmed.
