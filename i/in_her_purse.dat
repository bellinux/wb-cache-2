5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride. He removed all three items from her purse and hid them.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

25|$|Three days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown {{were arrested}} in Evanston. As Coleman and Brown walked westward across an intersection, they passed {{immediately}} {{in front of a}} man in a car stopped at the red light who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. He recognized Coleman and drove north to a gas station and notified the police. A description of the two was broadcast to police. As officers entered the area, a detective saw Coleman and Brown sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park, but noted they were wearing different T-shirts. As the detective reported this, two sergeants who were driving by the park heard this, turned, and saw Coleman and Brown. As they approached Coleman, the officers observed Brown walking away from Coleman toward the rear of the park. The detective joined the two sergeants and Coleman was approached for questioning; he had no identification and denied he was Alton Coleman. Meanwhile, two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston Police Department, where both were identified by their fingerprints.|$|E
25|$|When Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in 1933, Meitner was still acting as head of the physics {{department}} of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. Although she was protected by her Austrian citizenship, all other Jewish scientists, including Szil√°rd, Fritz Haber, her nephew Otto Frisch, and many other eminent figures, were dismissed or forced to resign from their posts. Most of them emigrated from Germany. Her response was to say nothing and bury herself in her work. After the Anschluss in March 1938, her situation became difficult. On July 13, 1938, Meitner, with the support of Otto Hahn and the help from the Dutch physicists Dirk Coster and Adriaan Fokker, departed for the Netherlands. She was forced to travel under cover to the Dutch border, where Coster persuaded German immigration officers that she had permission to travel to the Netherlands. She reached safety, though without her possessions. Meitner later said that she left Germany forever with 10 marks <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> Before she left, Otto Hahn had given her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother: this was to be used to bribe the frontier guards if required. It was not required, and Meitner's nephew's wife later wore it.|$|E
500|$|In Sonic Boom, {{although}} the two have very strong and obvious feelings for each other, they attempt to conceal them at every possibility. Sonic has a framed portrait of Amy in his home, while Amy carries a picture of Sonic <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> Whenever {{one of the two}} shows even the slightest attraction towards anyone else, the other becomes immensely jealous. These hidden feelings are often played with and made to be points of humor and entertainment in the series. In the episode [...] "Tails' Crush", Sonic reveals to Tails that his strategy to attract potential romantic interests is to simply act aloof and disinterested, while Amy tells Tails that she's partial to knightly and chivalrous behavior (and thus is likely waiting for Sonic to make the first move). Hence, the two have yet to make their feelings evident.|$|E
5000|$|Paisley {{said about}} the song: [...] "We had no idea at first {{where we were going}} with this song. It started out with us {{focusing}} on a guy who owns a bar. And we began with the scenario that he's there working after the bar is closed, sweeping and putting the chairs up. Then this girl comes <b>in</b> who's forgotten <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> We built the rest of the song around that concept. That's my favorite way of writing a song, because you never know where it's going. You're never pigeonholed by having to get from A to B, because you don't know what B is." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Elizabeth {{began to}} {{increase}} <b>her</b> role <b>in</b> leadership at St. Michael's, {{she and her}} husband were visited by the Rev. William A. Passavant on his way to the Ministerium of Pennsylvania. Passavant was known for his work in developing social ministries and he had recently opened an Orphan's Home in Pittsburg, PA. Depending on the account it differs as to which one made the original suggestion, but in talking Rev. Passavant and Elizabeth came to the conclusion that Philadelphia also needed an Orphans' Home. And so, Passavant said to her, [...] "Now, everything must have a beginning: I will give you the first dollar." [...] Elizabeth placed that dollar <b>in</b> <b>her</b> knitted <b>purse</b> and began working tirelessly to start the Lutheran Home at Germantown for Orphans.|$|R

The emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; Rebekah Del Rio comes on stage and begins singing the Roy Orbison song [...] "Crying" [...] in Spanish, then collapses while her vocals continue - her performance was a recording.

McSween serves Shepard with a warrant for her arrest on charges of prostitution in front of Beam who was visiting her. He offers them a deal. If they leave town within 24 hours, he won't chase them. She threatens to kill J.R. J.R. calls Dr. Rogers to take Sue Ellen away that night. J.R. hangs up on Leland who is continuing to threaten him. Sue Ellen continues to ponder the gun and tucks it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> before heading out somewhere. Cliff visits Digger Barnes' grave. He apologizes to his dad that he let J.R. beat him like Jock had beaten the father. J.R. is at the office at night when Rogers arrives at Southfork to cart Sue Ellen away.

500|$|The next day, {{he asked}} Green‚Äîwho had no {{interest}} in gardening that he knew of‚Äîwhat she had intended to do with the seeds. Though she initially claimed {{that she was going to}} plant them, when pressed she said that she intended to use them to commit suicide. Green's drinking was especially heavy that day, and as her behavior grew stranger, Farrar contacted the police for assistance in placing Green into psychiatric care. Police who responded to the home described Farrar and the children as [...] "shaken" [...] and Green's behavior as [...] "bizarre". Though Green did not seem to hold the police's presence against them and gave them no resistance, she denied being suicidal and called Farrar a series of obscenities. Farrar showed police the seed packets and other items he had found <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> the day before, and the police transported Green to a nearby emergency room. The physician who attended her there found Green to be smelling strongly of alcohol, but not visibly drunk. Though Green appeared unkempt, the doctor felt her demeanor was not unusual for someone going through a bitter divorce and noted that Green professed no desire to hurt herself or others when the doctor interviewed her privately. However, when Farrar came into view in the hospital, Green's demeanor changed. According to the doctor, Green spat at him, called him obscene names, and stated that [...] "You're going to get these kids over our dead bodies". Though Green, with some persuasion by the doctor, initially agreed to a voluntary commitment, she shortly thereafter left the ER without informing anyone. She was found hours later, apparently having decided to walk home from the hospital, and brought back to the hospital. There, she agreed again to a voluntary commitment to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas.|$|E

500|$|On June 30, Tarrants {{returned}} to Meridian {{to bomb the}} home of Meyer Davidson, an outspoken leader of the Jewish community, on 29th Avenue. The FBI and police chief Roy Gunn convinced Raymond and Alton Wayne Roberts, local Klan members, to gather information about the Klan's operations. Alton was free on bond after being convicted {{in connection with the}} murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964. Leaders of the Jewish communities in Jackson and in Meridian had raised money to pay the two informants, who tipped off the FBI about the attack before it happened. Fifteen police officers were hidden around Davidson's house shortly after midnight when a car stopped about [...] away from the house. Tarrants exited the vehicle with a box, later found to include 29 sticks of dynamite, and approached Davidson's carport. When police ordered him to stop, he dropped the box and fled to his vehicle. Officers then chased him for about 15 blocks before ramming the back of his vehicle, ending the chase. Tarrants opened fire on the policemen with a German-made 9mm submachine gun, striking officer J.M. Hatcher four times in the chest (though critically injured, the officer survived). Tarrants fled through the neighborhood continuing to fire at the policemen. Robert Burton, a resident of the neighborhood, opened his door {{to see what was going}} on and was struck by stray bullets. Police eventually found Tarrants in a pool of his own blood in a local resident's backyard. Kathy Ainsworth, a 26-year-old fifth grade school teacher from Jackson who had helped with the bombing of Jackson's synagogue a few months earlier, was found dead in the car with a loaded pistol <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> The car's owner was identified to be Danny Joe Hawkins, who had helped bomb Beth Israel; he was arrested on robbery charges a few weeks later. Tarrants survived his wounds and was sentenced to a thirty-year term in Parchman prison. He was paroled eight years into his term to enter the University of Mississippi after a religious conversion, and in 1992 he was training missionaries in North Carolina.|$|E

Alice confided to de Trafford that she had purchased the cottage in Happy Valley where they used to rendezvous at the start of their affair, deciding that it would be perfect for their honeymoon. [...] The idea that did not appeal to her new husband; {{during the course of the}} argument, Alice absent-mindedly reached into her purse, prompting a terrified de Trafford to flee, fearing a new murder attempt. Alice later claimed she had no pistol <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> nor had she the intention of shooting him, but instead wanted to powder her nose.|$|E

She had been dating Griffin for six weeks {{at the time of her}} death. Friends described her as being [...] "homey", as she did not go out with boys much. She was last seen with Griffin on Saturday at 2 p.m. at a W 7th street caf√©, and later around 10 p.m. at another caf√© on W 7th street, having dinner with Griffin's sister and her boyfriend. Her body was found fully clothed, sprawled face down across the back seat of Griffin's car, with a gunshot wound to the back of her head.
