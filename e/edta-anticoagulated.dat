40|$|To {{define the}} optimal blood {{collection}} parameters for plasma {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) viral load testing, plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels were quantitated with the NASBA HIV- 1 RNA QT System from blood specimens that were collected, processed, and stored {{under a variety of}} conditions that might have affected HIV- 1 RNA stability. We determined that when whole blood was processed within 2 h of specimen collection the levels of HIV- 1 RNA detected in EDTA-, heparin-, and acid citrate dextrose (ACD) -anticoagulated plasma samples were comparable. The levels of HIV- 1 RNA in serum specimens (mean = 4. 126 log units) were significantly lower (P < 0. 01) than the levels in corresponding plasma samples (mean = 4. 501 log units). One cycle of freeze-thaw (- 70 degrees C) did not significantly reduce the level of HIV- 1 RNA detected in EDTA-, heparin-, or ACD-anticoagulated plasmas. The <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> plasmas showed the smallest decrease in HIV- 1 RNA copies (0. 050 log units). HIV- 1 RNA levels decreased over a 6 -month time period in serum as well as in EDTA-, ACD-, and heparin-anticoagulated plasmas stored at - 70 degrees C. However, the only significant decreases were for serum (mean decrease = 0. 317 log units) and heparin-anticoagulated samples (mean decrease = 0. 384 log units). A comparison of the levels of HIV- 1 RNA in cell-free plasma collected in VACUTAINER EDTA Plasma Preparation Tubes and in standard VACUTAINER EDTA tubes determined that HIV- 1 RNA levels were stable for up to 30 h after collection when stored at either room temperature (mean standard deviation [SD] = +/- 0. 101 log units) or at 4 degrees C (mean SD = +/- 0. 102 log units) as cell-free plasma or as <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> whole blood (mean SD = +/- 0. 109 log units).

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} high temperature on hematologic parameters of human blood, we assessed complete blood cell counts, red cell indices, and platelet aggregability in 72 adult blood samples after exposure to varying degrees of temperature. There {{were no significant differences}} in erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) between pre- and post-treated groups when blood samples were treated at 50 °C for 5 min. Under the same conditions, however, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hematocrit became significantly higher in the post-treated group (p < 0. 01). A dramatic increase was observed in the numbers of platelets and eosinophils measured by electronic counter: the mean numbers of platelets and eosinophils in the post-treated group (2978. 2 x 109 /L and 5. 58 x 109 /L) were significantly higher than those for the pre-treated group (246. 6 x 109 /L and 0. 15 x 109 /L, p < 0. 01). Platelet clumps of varying size were seen in <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> blood after exposure to 46 °C for 90 sec; however, these clumps were not detected in citrate-, heparinized-, or washed <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> blood. Platelet aggregability to various agonists was profoundly decreased after treating the blood at 43 °C for 5 min. In summary, this study shows that critical changes of hematologic parameters occur when blood is exposed to 50 °C, and that the anticoagulating property of EDTA is altered upon exposure to high temperature...|$|E

40|$|Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) {{is widely}} used as {{anticoagulant}} in laboratory medicine. EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia is a rare phenomenon (i. e., around 0. 1 % in the general population), which is mostly due {{to the presence of}} EDTA-dependent antiplatelet antibodies that react optimally between 0 °C and 4 °C, recognize the cytoadhesive receptors gpIIb-IIIa, stimulate the expression of activation antigens, trigger activation of tyrosine kinase, platelet agglutination and clumping in vitro, which finally lead to a spuriously decreased platelet count. The reliable and timely identification of this artifact is essential, since there a high chance that it may be confused with other life-threatening platelet disorders, or otherwise lead to inappropriate clinical and therapeutic decision-making. Five basic criteria should be fulfilled to raise the clinical suspicion of EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia, i. e., (i) abnormal platelet count, typically < 100 × 10 (9) /L; (ii) occurrence of thrombocytopenia in <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> samples at room temperature, but to a much lesser extent in samples collected with other anticoagulants and/or kept warmed at ~ 37 °C; (iii) time-dependent fall of platelet count in the EDTA specimen; (iv) evidence of platelet aggregates and clumps in <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> samples with either automated cell counting or microscopic analysis; (v) lack of signs or symptoms of platelet disorders. Several remedies have been proposed, such as warming the sample to 37 °C or using additives or specific formulations of anticoagulants including buffered sodium citrate, heparin, ammonium oxalate, β-hydroxyethyltheophylline, sodium fluoride, CPT (trisodium citrate, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate and Tris), antiplatelet agents, potassium azide, amikacin, kanamycin or other aminoglycosides, and calcium replacement with the simultaneous addition of calcium chloride/heparin.

The first was an experimental study in which heparin- and <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> blood samples were collected from 101 HIV-positive individuals and processed to plasma after delays of 2, 6, and 18 h. HIV- 1 RNA levels in each sample were then measured by both branched-DNA (bDNA) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. Compared to samples processed within 2 h, the loss (decay) of HIV- 1 RNA in heparinized blood was significant (P < 0. 05) but small after 6 h (bDNA assay, − 0. 12 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 05 log 10 copies/ml) and after 18 h (bDNA assay, − 0. 27 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 15 log 10 copies/ml). Decay in <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> blood was not significant after 6 h (bDNA assay, − 0. 002 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 02 log 10 copies/ml), but it was after 18 h (bDNA assay, − 0. 09 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 09 log 10 copies/ml). Only 4 % of samples processed after 6 h lost more than 50 % (≥ 0. 3 log 10 copies/ml) of the HIV- 1 RNA, regardless of the anticoagulant or the assay that was used. The second study compared HIV- 1 RNA levels in samples from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS; samples were collected in heparin-containing tubes in 1985, had a 6 -h average processing delay, and were assayed by bDNA assay) and the British Columbia Drug Treatment Program (BCDTP) (collected in EDTA- or acid citrate dextrose-containing tubes in 1996 and 1997, had a 2 -h maximum processing delay, and were assayed by RT-PCR).

The layout and informatics of this clinical laboratory has been detailed in previous publications (Krasowski et al. 2014, 2015). The inclusion criteria were: (1) patient who had free light chain analysis performed on a serum specimen, (2) <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> and lithium heparin PST specimens drawn on patient for clinical testing during same phlebotomy encounter, and (3) sufficient specimen remaining in the EDTA and PST specimens for light chain analysis after performance of provider-ordered clinical testing. The details on the three specimen types were: BD Vacutainer® red top silica clot activator coated tube (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ), BD Vacutainer® light green top plasma separator tubes (PST™) containing polymer gel and lithium heparin (BD Diagnostics), and BD Vacutainer® pink top spray coated K 2 EDTA tube (BD Diagnostics). No extra tubes were drawn on any patient {{for purposes of this}} study, i.e., all analyses used pre-existing specimens leftover from clinical testing that would otherwise have been discarded.|$|E
30|$|The monocytes and {{neutrophils}} protein {{expression was}} evaluated by flow cytometry. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<b>EDTA)-anticoagulated</b> blood (100  μL) {{was used for}} flow cytometric analysis of fresh peripheral blood monocyte (m) and neutrophil (n) HSP 72 and HSP 90 α, and monocytes hGRα protein expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were determined after staining surface antigens CD 33 and CD 45 with 5  μL monoclonal antibodies CD 33 -PE/Cy 5 and CD 45 PE/Cy 7 (BioLegend, San Diego, USA) followed by HSP 72, HSP 90 α, and hGR intracellular staining with 5  μL HSP 72 -FITC, 5  μL HSP 90 α-PE, or 10  μL anti-hGR-FITC monoclonal antibodies, respectively (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Anti-hGRα antibodies conjugated to any fluorescence were not commercially available. Additionally, although hGR antibody detects all protein isoforms, hGRα is represented in almost 99 % of hGR protein [10]. Non-detection of hGRβ protein with flow cytometry would also be expected when it couldn’t be detected on RNA level. Isotype controls were used to check if blocking was needed. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Flow Cytometer FC- 500 (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} {{protein products}} (AOPP) are reportedly elevated in the plasma {{of patients with}} a number of diseases, including diabetes mellitus, that involve oxidative stress. However, the accurate measurement of AOPP in human plasma is hampered by the formation of a precipitate following the addition of potassium iodide and glacial acetic acid according to the published assay procedure. Here we describe a modification of the AOPP assay which eliminates interference by precipitation and provides a robust, reliable, and reproducible protocol for the measurement of iodide oxidising capacity in plasma samples (intra-assay CV 1. 7 - 5. 3 %, interassay CV 5. 3 - 10. 5 %). The improved method revealed a significant association of AOPP levels with age (p < 0. 05) and hypertension (p = 0. 01) in <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> plasma samples from 52 patients with diabetes and 38 nondiabetic control subjects, suggesting a possible link between plasma oxidising capacity and endothelial and/or vascular dysfunction. There {{was no significant difference between}} AOPP concentrations in diabetic (74. 8 ± 7. 2 [*]μM chloramine T equivalents) and nondiabetic (75. 5 ± 7. 0 [*]μM chloramine T equivalents) individuals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) {{provides}} a reliable measure of glycemic control over 2 – 3  months in human diabetes mellitus. In dogs, presence of HbA 1 c has been demonstrated, {{but there are}} no validated commercial assays. Objective: The {{purpose of the study was}} to validate a commercially available automated immunoturbidimetric assay for canine HbA 1 c and determine an RI in a hospital population. Methods: The specificity of the assay was assessed by inducing glycosylation in vitro using isolated canine hemoglobin, repeatability by measuring canine samples 5 times in succession, long term inter-assay imprecision by measuring supplied control materials, stability using samples stored at 4 °C over 5  days and − 20 °C over 8  weeks, linearity by mixing samples of known HbA 1 c in differing proportions, and the effect of anticoagulants with paired samples. An RI was determined using <b>EDTA-anticoagulated</b> blood samples from 60 nondiabetic hospitalized animals of various ages and breeds. Hemoglobin A 1 c was also measured in 10 diabetic dogs. Results: The concentration of HbA 1 c increased proportionally with glucose concentration in vitro. For repeat measurements, the CV was 4. 08...|$|E
