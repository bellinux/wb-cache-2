25|$|What <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{is that we were}} speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser {{testified that he}} was told, [...] "No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most {{of these people are}} immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money." ...|$|E
500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far he is {{prepared}} to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy nodded that he did. But {{just the}} same he couldn't think of {{anything}} else. He knew that old Mrs. Possum was right, and that it wasn't safe to go fooling around Farmer Brown's hen-house and leaving his tracks for everybody who came along to see. Just the same, Unc' Billy felt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a nice fresh egg. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it. That is all there was about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a lot {{of folks}} here this summer, mother says," [...] he appealed from the check <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Jackson. [...] "Every room taken for the whole month, she says." ...|$|R
60|$|Slowly he retraced his steps, {{not certain}} {{if he could}} find his way back to Park Row, a spot <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know fairly well since his coming to the metropolis.|$|R
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with All About Soap Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: [...] "It's {{the last thing he}} expected to hear. He didn't see it coming. He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to see}} him not!" [...] Delia fairly hooted. [...] "When did he grow so particular? He {{fixed it}} up," [...] she said with assurance. [...] "They always do in the papers--they'd be ashamed if they didn't. Well now <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bring out a piece praising them up--praising them to the skies: that's what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do!" [...] she wound up with decision.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{shop where}} people came and practised, paying sixpence an hour, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> like it--said {{it made a}} cheerful {{background}} to his thoughts. Wonderful {{what you can get}} accustomed to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I s'pose so," [...] said Toby, with a sigh, as he {{wondered}} whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{work as hard}} as that; [...] "but I s'pose you get all you want to eat, don't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sam {{put a few}} {{necessaries}} in a carpet-bag, and {{was ready}} for starting. He stopped when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} passage, and walking quietly back, thrust his head in at the parlour door.|$|R
6000|$|The girls {{remained}} there together {{and after a}} moment Delia resumed. [...] "Well, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fix it--that's one thing I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{words of}} an old soldier, Queen Whims, who has been so long at his trade that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take a strange {{pleasure}} in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What have I to do {{with her}} and her children? I did not marry her, and I am not their father. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> look to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Dog running] We {{spent two}} very {{pleasant}} days at Oxford. There {{are plenty of}} dogs {{in the town of}} Oxford. Montmorency had eleven fights on the first day, and fourteen on the second, and evidently thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> heaven.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{that part of}} his story we were some {{distance}} apart, as I had remained standing still while he, thinking me still close behind, had gone on picking blackberries and talking. He was soon out of sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rum fellow!" [...] {{said the}} man [...] "Knows what's what!" [...] and he whistled, and walked on. When <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side of}} the boat, he came across Haley, who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has {{not been}} down since the Session was over, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be quite a {{speaking}} man now. I do so hope he'll become something some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He jeered {{me while}} we were in the race. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take it back, or {{there is going to be}} trouble," [...] muttered the bully, {{clenching}} his fists.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is what he}} means," [...] Juan said, {{with great}} satisfaction. [...] "What <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do is to touch things, and for us {{to tell him the}} names." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 'ring' {{itself was}} rooted in Wolseley's {{appointments}} for the Ashanti Campaign of 1873-4, in which Wolseley led British troops {{to take control of}} the Gold Coast. He chose officers <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know during his Red River Campaign in Canada in 1870: ...|$|R
60|$|Reddy {{looked up}} with a sickly grin. There sat Unc' Billy Possum in a pine tree right over his head. He knew now {{that there was no}} backing out; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go on. <b>He</b> tried to swagger and look very bold and brave.|$|R
60|$|By and by, Rollo {{finished}} his book. It {{was quite a}} small story-book, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been reading it some time, and so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end. <b>He</b> laid the book down, therefore, upon the table, and began to consider {{what he should do}} next.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he won't, he's {{so tired}} he will soon drop {{off and then}} the matter is settled, for he will {{understand}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> mind. Don't interfere, I'll manage him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I’ll ask him—up at the congress; I can do that. I suppose <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> marry some one.” The {{young man}} {{added in a}} moment: “And {{she may be a}} good thing.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Odious? Eh? And {{you have}} no notion what a mass of work <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get through every day. He does it all himself. Seems unable to trust anyone with these Fisheries.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{summarised}} Grace's status {{at the end}} of the 1866 season thus: [...] "He was {{no longer}} climbing the ladder; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the top, although he was still destined to add a few more rungs to it, dizzy rungs utterly beyond anyone else's reach".|$|R
60|$|The King thanked him, {{put on the}} shoes, {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> him who was Lord of all {{the fish in the}} sea, he turned the snow shoes round, and back they went just as the others <b>had</b> gone, and <b>he</b> asked once more where Whiteland was.|$|R
60|$|But he {{remained}} too late. The inner gate was locked, and the lodge closed. After a little fruitless knocking with his hand, {{he was standing}} there with the disagreeable conviction upon him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get through the night, when a voice accosted him from behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have sung {{away all}} that I knew, mother. There's Culpepper {{has not had}} a chance yet. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> give us his dream--how he 'dreamt that he dwelt in marble halls!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say now," [...] he mused, {{and then as}} the others began reading their letters, he opened the {{envelope}} {{and took out the}} single sheet it contained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's doin' {{as well as}} can be expected, Mr. Tom. The {{doctors say}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> keep quiet. Your Aunt Martha said to warn both of you not to excite him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} on all right," [...] he said to Hawkins, when he went up. [...] "There is no fever yet, anyhow, for <b>he</b> <b>has</b> drunk only half that glass of lime juice. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been feverish <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> stopped until <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} {{late in the}} {{afternoon}} when Johnny finally felt rested enough <b>to</b> go on. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> find a place to spend the night. He hobbled along, for he was very stiff and sore, until he came {{to the edge of the}} Green Meadows, where they meet the Green Forest.|$|R
6000|$|The nephew was {{not quite}} sure what a moral was; but at the bottom of his heart he would just as soon have it a little-pig story as not. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{thinking}} how funny a little pig would look in a Prince's clothes, and he said, [...] "Yes, it'll be for the moral." ...|$|R
