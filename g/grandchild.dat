40|$|When parents divorce, {{grandparents}} {{can play}} a supportive role {{in the lives of}} their <b>grandchildren,</b> but a parental divorce may also put grandchild-grandparent ties under pressure. This article investigates how <b>grandchildren</b> of married and divorced parents differ in the frequency of face-to-face contacts with grandparents, and how this is mediated by post-divorce residence arrangements. Based on the multi-actor survey ‘Divorce in Flanders’, we use reports of contact provided by more than 1000 <b>grandchildren</b> and compare them with over 1100 grandparent reports for validation. Results show that <b>grandchildren</b> from divorced parents have fewer contacts with their grandparents than <b>grandchildren</b> whose parents are married, but we demonstrate that it is the post-divorce residence arrangement of <b>grandchildren</b> that produces this result. When <b>grandchildren</b> live with their divorced father or in a shared residence arrangement, they even see paternal grandparents more often than <b>grandchildren</b> with married parents. Key words: Child custody, co-parenting divorce, <b>grandchildren,</b> grandparents, intergenerational relationsstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although grandfamilies are {{consumers}} {{of a variety}} of mental health services, less is known about what these families, particularly the <b>grandchildren,</b> want from practitioners. To gain insight into how practitioners can best meet the needs of grandfamilies, 40 custodial grandmothers and their adolescent <b>grandchildren</b> were interviewed. Results of a qualitative analysis indicated that grandmothers and <b>grandchildren</b> did not make clear distinctions between various types of services and service providers. <b>Grandchildren,</b> in particular, emphasized the need for mental health professionals to facilitate mentoring and to provide opportunities for <b>grandchildren</b> to socialize with other <b>grandchildren</b> who have been through similar circumstances. Grandmothers and <b>grandchildren</b> both recommended promoting problem solving, offering services for <b>grandchildren,</b> and being responsive to the families’ unique needs. Participants also suggested that practitioners avoid making judgments, educate themselves about grandfamilies, advocate for their families, and attend to the experiences of both grandmothers and <b>grandchildren.</b> Implications of the findings for mental health practitioners are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, <b>grandchild</b> of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder.

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a <b>grandchild</b> of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family.
