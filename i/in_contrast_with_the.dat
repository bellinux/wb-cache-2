5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, {{it is probable that}} more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{academic}} {{circles the}} case is generally seen {{as an example of}} the court taking two different approaches to statutory interpretation, with the legalistic approach of the majority judges <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> purposive approach of the minority judges.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Sahajanand Swami was {{appointed}} successor to Ramanand Swami {{as the leader of}} the Uddhav Sampraday by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampraday henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacarya.|$|E

5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 {{the company}} {{repaired}} {{its relationship with}} its franchisees by immediately dropping the most contentious of the contract terms that had been proposed by chairman John Cranor five years previously. The 1976 contract was restored, including the 1.5 mile outlet exclusivity zone, while the parent company gained greater control over national advertising. Novak also axed the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non-fried item called the Tender Roast. Tender Roast was served by piece, as with the fried chicken, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rotisserie product, which had been sold in quarter, half or whole chicken portions. Afterwards, Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America. As {{a result of his}} success at KFC North America, Novak became President and CEO of the entire KFC organization in 1996.|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> busy {{preceding}} season, {{this season}} had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there}} was a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal. However, the number of days with a tropical cyclone was slightly above normal at 15. In general, the southern hemisphere as a whole had the least active season since 1954. There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage was much less than the preceding year.|$|E
5|$|In the Tosco-Emilian Apennines, P.fluviatile is {{only found}} {{south of the}} watershed, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{crayfish}} Austropotamobius pallipes, which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because the crab outcompetes the crayfish, which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where the crab cannot survive. Non-indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining of wetlands.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 1834, Pierce married Jane Means Appleton (March 12, 1806– December 2, 1863), the {{daughter}} of Jesse Appleton, a Congregational minister {{and former president of}} Bowdoin College, and Elizabeth Means. The Appletons were prominent Whigs, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance, encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Muslim Arabs brought drastic changes to Gaza; its churches were {{transformed}} into mosques, including the Cathedral of John the Baptist (previously the Temple of Marnas) which became the Great Mosque of Gaza. Gaza's population adopted Islam as their religion relatively quick <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> city's countryside. Eventually, Arabic became the official language. The Christian population was reduced to an insignificant minority and the Samaritan residents deposited their property with their high priest and fled the city east upon the Muslim conquest. Gaza was placed under the administration of Jund Filastin ("District of Palestine") of Bilad al-Sham province during Rashidun rule, and {{continued to be a}} part of the district under the successive caliphates of the Umayyads and Abbasids.|$|E

5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} {{officials}} in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti {{was the chief}} scholar among the ulama (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years at a time <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his judicial decisions had {{to be approved by}} the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who {{in the last years of}} his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, Rippy had {{completed}} all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world tracks. In the game's skirmish mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions. To ensure that {{the character of the}} music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, he added a short introductory piece containing common elements. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> skirmish mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship Spirit of Fire. Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months. Rippy finished the score by February 2008, and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.|$|E
