Although the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) was keeping the Allied forces contained along the Siegfried Line, the campaign had cost the Wehrmacht nearly 750,000 casualties, mostly irreplaceable. However, the rapid advance of the Allied armies in August and September after Operation Overlord had created a supply problem for the Allies. By October, the progress of the Western Allies' three army groups had slowed considerably, allowing the Germans to partly rebuild their strength and prepare for the defense of Germany itself. Adolf Hitler, the German leader, decided {{that the only way to}} reverse his fortunes would be to launch a counter-offensive on the Western Front, forcing both the United States and Great Britain to an early peace, and allowing the Wehrmacht to shift its forces to the Eastern Front, where it could defeat the much larger Soviet Red Army.|$|E

Your other {{question}} is harder to answer. It is my habit to keep four or five books in process of erection all the time, and every summer add a few courses of bricks to two or three of them; but I cannot forecast which of the two or three it is going to be. It takes seven years to complete a book by this method, but still it is a good method: gives the public a rest. I have been accused of [...] "rushing into print" [...] prematurely, moved thereto by greediness for money; but in truth I have never done that. Do you care for trifles of information? (Well, then, [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] and [...] "The Prince and the Pauper" [...] were each on the stocks two or three years, and [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi" [...] eight.) One of my unfinished books has been on the stocks sixteen years; another seventeen.

I do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for rushing into print, but at the same time I don't believe that the charge is really well founded. Suppose I did write eleven books, have you nothing to be grateful for? Go to---remember the forty-nine which I didn't write.|$|E

40|$|The Guadalfeo and the Adra {{submarine}} deltas off {{the northern}} {{coast of the}} Alboran Sea have been built up under the direct influence of short and mountainous rivers. The area is subjected to strong climatic seasonality, with sporadic winter torrential floods and high summer aridity. In addition numerous anthropogenic activities have affected these systems, mostly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> last two centuries. In order to decode the influence of climatic variability and anthropogenic impacts on sediment supplies <b>during</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>past,</b> <b>five</b> sediment cores were collected from the Guadalfeo and Adra submarine deltas. Benthic foraminiferal and sedimentological analyses, combined with radiocarbon dating, were performed. The impact of torrential floods alternating with periods of low rainfall or dry periods were recorded in the Adra and Guadalfeo prodeltas. Periods with low abundance of benthic foraminifera and high amounts of coarse-grained sediments, were interpreted {{as the result of}} enhanced sediment supply to the shelf triggered by major flood events. On the other hand, periods with high amounts of fine-grained sediments and high abundances of colonizers and opportunistic foraminiferal species indicate the establishment of new environments with distinct ecological constraints. These environments were driven by lower sediment supplies during low rainfall or dry periods. The most recent sedimentation seems to reflect the human interventions in the rivers basins, such as deviation of the main river courses and dams construction, which reduced the sediment input and promoted the deposition of shallow-water submarine deltas. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{first edition}} of Sound and Structural Vibration {{was written in the}} early 1980 s. Since then, two major {{developments}} have taken place in the field of vibroacoustics. Powerful computational methods and procedures for the numerical analysis of structural vibration, acoustical fields and acoustical interactions between fluids and structures have been developed and these are now universally employed by researchers, consultants and industrial organisations. Advances in signal processing systems and algorithms, in transducers, and in structural materials and forms of construction, have facilitated the development of practical means of applying active and adaptive control systems to structures for the purposes of reducing or modifying structural vibration and the associated sound radiation and transmission. In this greatly expanded and extensively revised edition, the authors have retained most of the analytically based material that forms the pedagogical content of the first edition, and have expanded it to present the theoretical foundations of modern numerical analysis. Application of the latter is illustrated by examples that have been chosen to complement the analytical approaches to solving fairly simple problems of sound radiation, transmission and fluid-structural coupling that are presented in the first edition. The number of examples of experimental data that relate to the theoretical content, and illustrate important features of vibroacoustic interaction, has been augmented by the inclusion of a selection from the vast amount of material published <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> twenty <b>five</b> years. <b>The</b> final chapter on the active control of sound and vibration has no precursor in the first edition...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} entitled 'Difference, Identification & Desire: Contemporary Lesbian Genre Fiction' is the representation of lesbian identity in four contemporary popular lesbian genres: autobiographical fiction, speculative fiction, romance fiction and crime fiction. The aim of the dissertation is three-fold. Firstly, it seeks to acknowledge and celebrate the large variety of representations of lesbianism produced by lesbian writers working with popular forms of <b>the</b> novel <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> twenty <b>five</b> years. Secondly, it explores {{the ways in which}} lesbian writers have reworked popular genres in order to highlight lesbian and feminist concerns and to depict aspects of lesbian existence. It analyzes the effects of introducing discourses of lesbianism into the plots of popular genres, showing how the latter have been subverted or adapted by lesbian use. Thirdly, the thesis seeks to specify {{the ways in which the}} generic forms themselves, according to their own codes and conventions, shape and mediate the representation of lesbian identity in the text. In addition to this focus, the dissertation traces a number of themes and concerns across and within the four genres under discussion. These include the relationship in the texts between the sign 'lesbian' and the discourse of feminism, and the oscillation between the representation of lesbian sexual identity in terms of woman-identification and difference-between women. The aim throughout the analysis of contemporary lesbian genre fiction is to identify both that which is specific to lesbian representation and that which is characteristic of the particular genre under discussion. The dissertation represents a contribution to three areas of literary study: Genre Studies and Feminist Studies in general, and to Lesbian Studies in particular...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note describes modifications of simulation models for growth of four submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) types, greatly expanding their application potential. The modifications include {{descriptions of the}} vegetation responses to daily changes in current velocity and epiphyte shading, and accommodation of daily changes in water level. These models {{can be used to}} evaluate key environmental conditions in which SAV would persist under a variety of management scenarios within the watershed. The models are available as stand-alone versions, and can be used singly and in combination with hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. BACKGROUND: SAV {{plays an important role in}} aquatic ecosystems. Desirable species stabilize sediment, ameliorate transparency and regulate nutrient availability in the water column, and serve as habitat and food sources for invertebrates, fish, and waterfowl. Many SAV communities in freshwater and marine environments have experienced dramatic losses <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three to <b>five</b> decades. Declines are attributed to decreases in water transparency due to anthropogenic influences, but often they have been attributed to other factors such as high water levels, extended draw-downs, changes in current velocity, and epiphyte shading, or t...|$|R

These patients were 63 years old on the average, 78 males and 28 females, 29 cases of the hilar type (H) and 77 of the peripheral type (P), and 27 and 76 cases of the clinical stage I in H and P, respectively. Histologically, there were 53 adenocarcinomas (Ad), 38 squamous cell carcinomas (Sq), 4 adenosquamous cell carcinomas (Ad + Sq), 5 large cell carcinomas (LCC), and 6 small cell carcinomas (SCC); among them, 3 Ad and 21 Sq in H, and 50 Ad and 17 Sq in P. The overall positive percentages were 65. 5 (H) and 26. 0 (P) by combination of spontaneous, airsol-induced and Saccomanno's methods, against 96. 6 (H) and 72. 8 (P) with inclusion of brushing method. 94. 8 % of Sq in H and 66. 7 % of Ad and 70. 6 % of Sq in P were positive by the brushing. A comparative study of these four methods, performed at least once on the same patient, also confirmed the superiority of brushing. Cyto- and histological agreement was 21 / 21 (100 %) for Sq in H, whereas 30 / 34 (88. 2 %) for Ad and 13 / 15 (86. 7 %) for Sq in P.
