5|$|After the {{departure}} of Damien Duff to Newcastle United, Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff. The season was a personal success for Drogba as he hit 33 goals in all competitions (more than his tally in the previous two seasons combined), including 20 in the Premier League to win the Golden Boot. In doing so, {{he became the first}} Chelsea player since Kerry Dixon in 1984–85 to reach 30 goals in a season, scoring 20 in the Premier League, six in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take command of HMS Bellerophon, whose captain, John Cooke had been killed by a French sniper. Cooke had been targeted due to the dress uniform <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> during the battle. Bellerophon escorted Victory carrying Nelson's body back to Britain, and Rotheram carried the guidon behind the coffin at Nelson's funeral in London. Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action, and continued in command of Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E

5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of squad numbers for the 1993–94 Premier League, Robson was issued with the number 12 shirt, while the number 7 shirt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> in virtually every game of his career went to Eric Cantona instead.|$|E

In summer 2014, Trebek regrew the mustache for the 31st season of Jeopardy! – only to shave it off again a month into the season.|$|E

25|$|No Oakland player wore Russell's #2 {{during the}} regular season for several years after his release; only punter Marquette King donned it, during Oakland's 2012 preseason before being placed on season-ending injured reserve. In 2011, newly drafted quarterback Terrelle Pryor's request to wear #2 was turned down by then-coach Hue Jackson; it is widely {{believed}} that the Raiders did not want another highly touted quarterback wearing the same number as the disappointing Russell. However, in 2013 Raiders coach Dennis Allen allowed Pryor to trade numbers with King; he debuted on Oakland's practice field on August 21, 2013 wearing the jersey number <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> at Ohio State.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees {{for second}} baseman Alfonso Soriano and {{a player to}} be named later (Joaquín Árias {{was sent to the}} Rangers on March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67million of the $179million left on Rodriguez's contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch {{positions}} from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular Derek Jeter was already entrenched at shortstop. Rodriguez also had to switch uniform numbers, from 3 to 13; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> 3 his entire career, but that number is retired by the Yankees in honor of Babe Ruth.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} {{symbol of}} the Bhutanese monarchy is the Raven Crown, worn by reigning monarchs since the reign of Ugyen Wangchuck (1907–1926). The first King of Bhutan Ugyen Wangchuck adopted as the unique symbol of his authority a crown surmounted {{by the head of}} a raven. The bird represents a form of Mahakala, Bhutan's guardian deity. The prototype of the founding monarch's Raven Crown had first been devised as a battle helmet for his father, Jigme Namgyel (1825–81). Known as the Black Regent, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> it in bloody struggles against his many rivals within the country and against the British who tried, unsuccessfully, to subdue him.|$|E
25|$|Raeder {{claimed in}} his 1957 memoirs Mein Leben {{that he had}} first learned that the regime in which he served so long was a {{criminal}} regime in March 1945 when he visited his old colleague, the former Defence Minister Otto Gessler in a hospital when he was recovering from the torture he received in a concentration camp. Shocked at Gessler's appearance, Raeder decided to protest against the Nazi regime by not wearing the Nazi Golden Party Badge that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> until then. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett mocked Raeder for taking until March 1945 {{to discover that the}} Nazi regime was a criminal regime, and called his protest via not wearing his Golden Party Badge pathetic.|$|E
25|$|On 23 November 2012, the Richmond Football Club {{announced}} Cotchin's {{appointment as}} club captain for the 2013 season. With this appointment {{he became the}} 40th captain in Richmond's VFL/AFL history, and the youngest Richmond captain in more than 100 years. Cotchin broke with recent tradition by choosing to continue wearing his number nine jumper instead of adopting the club's number seventeen guernsey. Former captains Wayne Campbell, Kane Johnson and Chris Newman had all previously adopted the number in honour of club legend Jack Dyer {{after his death in}} 2003. Cotchin explained that he held the club's history and Dyer in high regard but he had decided to keep the number nine because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> it throughout his football career including his junior years.|$|E

25|$|Following Tiberius' {{death and}} the {{ascension}} of Agrippa's friend Caligula in 37, Agrippa was set free and made king of the territories of Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis, which his uncle Philip the Tetrarch had held, {{with the addition of}} Abila. Agrippa was also awarded the ornamenta praetoria and could use the title amicus caesaris ("friend of Caesar"). Caligula also presented him with a gold chain equal in weight to the iron one <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> in prison, which Agrippa dedicated to the Temple of Jerusalem on his return to his ancestral homeland. In 39, Agrippa returned to Rome, and brought about the banishment of his uncle, Herod Antipas; he was then granted his uncle's tetrarchy, consisting of Galilee and Peraea. This created a Jewish kingdom which did not include Judea at its center.|$|E
25|$|The Yankees won {{the pennant}} in 1976 but were swept in the World Series. A month later on November 29, they signed Jackson to a five-year {{contract}} totaling $2.96 million ($ in current dollar terms). The number 9 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> in Oakland and Baltimore was already used by Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles; Jackson asked for number 42 in memory of Jackie Robinson, but that number was given to pitching coach Art Fowler {{before the start of}} the season. Noting that Hank Aaron, at the time the holder of the career record for the most home runs, had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44 as a tribute to Aaron. Jackson wore number 20 for one game during spring training as a tribute to the also recently retired Frank Robinson, then he switched to number 44.|$|E
25|$|Messier's {{return to}} Canada {{after six years}} with the Rangers was an {{emotional}} and high-profile event, but the bliss was brief. Before the season started, captain Trevor Linden relinquished the captaincy to Messier, a move that did not go over well with Canucks supporters. Amidst a turbulent season, in which {{president and general manager}} Pat Quinn and head coach Tom Renney were fired, Linden was eventually traded by new coach and acting general manager Mike Keenan to the New York Islanders, where he became their captain, replacing Bryan McCabe, for whom Linden was traded along with Todd Bertuzzi. Messier's demand to receive the number No.11, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> throughout his career with the Oilers and Rangers, but which the Canucks had unofficially retired after Wayne Maki's unexpected death in 1974, hurt his image as well.|$|E

25|$|Manchester United had {{a number}} of players missing due to injury. Edwin van der Sar {{strained}} his calf in the warm-up before United's FA Cup match against Middlesbrough on 10 March, and Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić picked up knocks in the same game. Other long-term injury concerns included Mikaël Silvestre (dislocated shoulder), Darren Fletcher (ankle), Louis Saha (hamstring) and Ole Gunnar Solskjær (knee). However, Alan Smith was available as he made his recovery from a broken leg and dislocated ankle he suffered in February 2006. There were also places in the team for youngsters Kieran Richardson, Chris Eagles and Tom Heaton, while Dong Fangzhuo – recently returned from a loan spell at Royal Antwerp after receiving a UK work permit – was added to the first-team squad to bolster a depleted strike force. Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's earlier assertions that the Manchester United team would be entirely composed of current players, they had a guest player of their own: Andy Cole – then of Portsmouth – made a return to Old Trafford in the number 9 shirt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> for the majority of his career there.|$|E
25|$|Salam {{very early}} {{established}} a reputation throughout the Punjab and {{later at the}} University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the Punjab University. He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore, Punjab State. Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration. Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan's problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. His father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service. In those days, the Indian Civil Service was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in the civil society. Respecting his father's wish, Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>worn</b> spectacles since an early age. The results further concluded that Salam failed a mechanical test required by the railway engineers to gain a commission in Indian Railways, and moreover that Salam {{was too young to}} compete for the job. Therefore, Indian Railways rejected Abdus Salam's job application. While in Lahore, Abdus Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University. He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, but Salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory. Salam returned to Jhang, Punjab (now part of Pakistan) and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate.|$|E
