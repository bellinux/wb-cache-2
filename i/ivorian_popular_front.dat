500|$|Laurent Gbagbo gained {{recognition}} {{as one of}} the principal instigators of the student demonstrations during the protests against Houphouët-Boigny's government on 9 February 1982, which led to the closing of the universities and other educational institutions. Shortly thereafter, his wife and he formed what would become the <b>Ivorian</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> (FPI). Gbagbo went into exile in France later that year, where he promoted the FPI and its political platforms. Although the FPI was ideologically similar to the Unified Socialist Party, the French socialist government tried to ignore Gbagbo's party to please Houphouët-Boigny. After a lengthy appeal process, Gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in France in 1985. However, the French government attempted to pressure him into returning to Côte d'Ivoire, as Houphouët-Boigny had begun to worry about Gbagbo's developing a network of contacts, and believed [...] "his stirring opponent would be less of a threat in Abidjan than in Paris".|$|E

40|$|Is {{there one}} or several French languages? What about African French language? The {{linguistic}} studies on French in Africa accentuate {{the uniqueness of}} the <b>Ivorian</b> <b>popular</b> French. Since <b>Ivorians</b> speak many different languages and as they have no real vehicular language, they appropriated the French which was implanted and imposed {{at the time of the}} colonization. Today, we witness the presence of various types of French (acrolectal, mesolectal, basilectal) that people use as a result of the effort to adapt this foreign language to local reality. The main purpose of this study is to classify some of the different characteristic features of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Ivorian</b> French according to previous studies, then to identify those features of <b>Popular</b> <b>Ivorian</b> French in Ahmadou Kourouma’s novel Allah is not obliged. We identified fourteen characteristics which particularize <b>Popular</b> <b>Ivorian</b> French. Most of these characteristics are present in Kourouma’s Allah is not obliged but some are not.   In conclusion, we can see that the Ivoirians have adapted and shapedFrench to create a language they feel at home with. They have added new expressions, neologisms and metaphors in order to better convey their messages and to better understand each others. ...|$|R

5000|$|Hitler's regime swiftly {{destroyed}} {{both the}} German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> against fascism. The socialist parties were at first suspicious, given the bitter hostility of the 1920s, but eventually effective <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> were formed in both France and Spain. After {{the election of}} a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the Spanish Civil War. The crisis in Spain also brought down the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> were not able {{to prevent the spread of}} fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> a [...] "strike breaking conspiracy" [...] and considered them an impediment to successful resistance to fascism.|$|R
