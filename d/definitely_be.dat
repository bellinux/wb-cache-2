With its discontinuance in Japan, Agitos western release was consequently cancelled, however it was stated that Type-0 Online was being considered for international release in place of Agito.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{high school}} years usually have two semesters, {{starting}} in September and February. In some rural areas, operation {{may be subject to}} agricultural cycles.

25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport approach path, with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it would <b>definitely</b> <b>be</b> possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed risk mitigation measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the glide slope approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above the birds), and the installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E

Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can <b>definitely</b> <b>be</b> seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.|$|E
