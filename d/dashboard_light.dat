50|$|As of the 2015 season, {{the drivers}} are only {{permitted}} {{to use the}} DRS system in the designated overtaking zones. A <b>dashboard</b> <b>light</b> notifies the driver when the system is enabled. The system is deactivated when the driver releases the button or uses the brakes.|$|E
50|$|This {{resulted}} in a transmission with a typical 4 speed 'H' pattern shift mechanism, plus an additional 2 speed 'high-low' selector which effectively split each of the 4 speed gears in two. This meant 8 forward gears in total. It was also possible to use the 2 speed selector in reverse, meaning that two reverse gears also existed. In the majority of cars, the 2 speed selector was labelled as 'Power' for the lower range, and 'Economy' for the higher range. In some cars the 2 speed selector was labelled with a star icon for the lower range and 'E' (economy) for the higher range. A <b>dashboard</b> <b>light</b> system was used to indicate which mode was selected.|$|E
50|$|To prevent drivers {{from using}} DRL when low beam {{headlights}} are needed, some regions require the <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights</b> {{to be turned}} off when DRL are turned on.|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{conducted}} by some insurance companies highlighted {{that the most}} part of drivers {{do not know the}} meaning of the <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights.</b> This leads drivers to be dangerous for others and themselves. Hence, the need to provide drivers with tools that support them to always be aware of the state of their cars. This paper proposes a system for mobile devices that uses augmented reality {{to be able to give}} information on a particular <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights.</b> The system is implemented by combining the use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) maps with central moment computation widely used in computer vision. Preliminary research results show that the proposed system achieves its goal enables a a real-time visual feedback...|$|R
50|$|The {{basis of}} Team Green's {{argument}} was that Tracy {{was the leader}} when the yellow lights around the track came on, and that those lights should control. While they acknowledged that Castroneves was leading at the time Barnhart called for the yellow, they argued it was irrelevant unless the yellow lights were on. They also did not dispute {{that it was possible}} that the <b>dashboard</b> yellow <b>lights</b> on Castroneves' car came on while Castroneves was still leading. They cited the inconsistencies of the dashboard system from car to car, and claimed the <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights</b> had not come on in Tracy's car until after he had made the pass.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Love Fest grew to {{a greater}} scale {{featuring}} five bands with a ten dollar ticket price for admission. Dont Hate, Love Fest 08 was the slogan for that year and was featured on all the tickets and banner. The event was undertaken by the newly formed GrapeVinyl Records, run by Griffin Sokal, Jared Adams, Jesse Millar and Logan McCort. On July 4, 2008, Love Fest yet again featured The Experiences and The Ruffigans with Astronaut Jones and the Dirty Sweethearts, Gary Gach and the Banned and The Monty Yanks making their Love Fest debut. The festival went until roughly {{five in the morning}} with the final band, The Experiences not going on until 2:30 AM. Notable events of the 2008 Love Fest are Astronaut Jones two-hour-long set that delayed the festival, the super jam rendition of Meat Loafs Paradise by the <b>Dashboard</b> <b>Light</b> by The Ruffigans featuring Jennifer Bihun and Jesse Millar of The Experiences and the amazing fireworks show. The attendance for the 2008 Love Fest was an estimated three hundred people.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} to have been Meat and Jim Steinman together. However, due to Jim falling ill, Meat had to do the show alone. This worried the producers, as Storytellers is about the concept of each song that an artist wrote that they were about to perform, and Meat did not write his own songs. To counter this, {{according}} to the liner notes of the CD, Meat improvised several things, such as the actions on the Radio Broadcast portion of Paradise by the <b>Dashboard</b> <b>Light.</b> For the stories, he instead goes into detail about how the hit album Bat Out of Hell was conceived, with each song preceded by him discussing how the song fit into the making of the album and the difficulties that came into making, producing, and publishing the album. Meat also pitched a solution to how to get around the length of the songs: break up songs into two television segments, with stopping the song for a commercial, then finishing the song once they returned.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{a wave of}} {{technological}} innovations have turned many of the gadgets we use into smart devices. However, some areas of industry remain somewhat isolated from modernization with little to no improvements in their overall functionality. Traffic lights at an intersection are {{a perfect example of}} a technology that has remained behind the times. While {{there is a lot of}} potential for reducing CO 2 gas emissions, oil consumption, and commuting times, research in this area has resulted in minor changes. In this thesis, we improve on what others have learned to provide a solution in vehicle coordination that is smart, practical and innovative. We leverage the power of Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANET’s) to develop a Vehicle Traffic <b>Dashboard</b> <b>Light</b> System that can gather real- time traffic information to effectively coordinate vehicles crossing a 4 -way intersection. In detail, we developed a Lazy Algorithm that focuses on reducing vehicular average waiting times, maximizing intersection throughput and minimizes the number of vehicles that need to make unnecessary stops. We then compare the Lazy Algorithm to two other algorithms by conducting various simulations. Furthermore, we study the impact on the average waiting time vehicles experience while crossing two consecutive intersections equipped with a Vehicle Traffic <b>Dashboard</b> <b>Light</b> System. The results from our many vi simulations are promising and indicate that such an algorithm could potentially be used for coordinating human-driven vehicles. Under heavy traffic conditions, we have seen a reduction of up to 69. 7 % in average waiting time in comparison to the tradition Pre-Time traffic light algorithm and 89 % in comparison to the FIFO Algorithm. With such results, we feel that the VDTL Systems bring us closer to the era of vehicle automation. Computer EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

5000|$|On July 2, 2002, Tony George {{issued an}} 18-page {{decision}} to the appeal. He upheld {{the victory of}} Hélio Castroneves, and denied Team Green's appeal. In his decision, George stated that [...] "Clearly Helio (Castroneves) was in front when the call (for the yellow) was made" [...] and {{that several of the}} caution signals, including trackside and <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights,</b> a radio announcement and a flag closing the pits, were displayed before Tracy's pass.|$|R
50|$|In October 2003 Grieve went to England to {{play the}} role of Gaston in Beauty & The Beast, and has since {{performed}} in the London premiere of Europe by Australian playwright Michael Gow at the Finborough Theatre, and in a showcase of the new musical Paradise By The <b>Dashboard</b> <b>Lights.</b> He toured the UK in a new stage production of Dial M For Murder by Frederick Knott.

50|$|For example, {{a person}} driving an {{automobile}} has several means of being {{informed about the}} operation of the engine. In addition to the <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights,</b> the driver also perceives the sound and vibration of the engine. An abnormal sound or vibration alerts the driver {{that there may be a}} problem, while a typical sound or vibration assures the driver that everything is going as normal. Making the automobile completely silent might negatively impact the performance of the driver, as he must expend additional effort to stay informed about the operation of vehicle.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{equipment}} was ample for the period, {{consisting of a}} speedometer with recording odometer, an ammeter, and the <b>dashboard</b> incorporating <b>lighting.</b> The horn initially was a classical trumpet with rubber bulb; this was replaced by an electric horn beginning in 1925.|$|R
50|$|For the North American market, {{development}} {{followed a}} separate path. Since debuting at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, the restyled 2008-2011 generation was {{available as a}} two-door coupe and four-door sedan; the hatchbacks and wagon were discontinued. The interior was redesigned, including new seats, a new dashboard design with message center {{on top of the}} <b>dashboard,</b> ambient <b>lighting,</b> <b>dashboard</b> panels that simulate brushed aluminum, and Ford's voice-controlled Sync audio/Bluetooth system. Also included in the redesign was a support beam behind the dashboard for extra structural rigidity.|$|R
50|$|Illuminationhigh-power LEDs {{in various}} white tones and all {{possible}} colors, are currently making inroads in all lighting sectors, including room lighting, architecture lighting, and street lighting. LEDs from OSRAM {{have been used}} in the automotive sector for a number of years. In this sector the company sells products ranging from <b>dashboard</b> <b>lighting</b> right up to headlights on cars. Since 2010, in the new version of the Audi A8, LEDs have taken on major lighting functions in main headlamps. The OSTAR platform, the most powerful LED solution so far, includes high-power LEDs for numerous applications including: lighting, projection, rear projection television (RPTV), and as IR light sources for both observation for use in the security sector.|$|R
50|$|When Arnie {{is almost}} {{finished}} restoring Christine, an attractive girl named Leigh Cabot transfers to his high school. She {{is regarded as}} the school beauty and her decision to go out with Arnie puzzles everyone. While on a date with Arnie, she nearly chokes to death on a hamburger and is saved only by the intervention of a hitchhiker who uses the Heimlich maneuver. Leigh notices that Christine's <b>dashboard</b> <b>lights</b> seemed to become glaring green eyes, watching her during the incident, and that Arnie tried to save her by ineffectually pounding her on the back. She realizes that she and Christine are competing for Arnie's affection and vows to never get into the car again.|$|R
50|$|Since debuting at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, the restyled North American second {{generation}} Ford Focus {{has been sold}} by Ford as either a two-door coupe and 4-door sedan — the hatchbacks and wagon were discontinued.

5000|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the race, confusion reigned among the competitors, broadcasters, and fans. Brian Barnhart, in Race Control, made the initial call at the moment, stating [...] "yellow, yellow, yellow, three is your leader" [...] ("three" [...] being Castroneves car number) over the director's radio channel, and such was repeated by his assistant Mel Harder over the teams' race control radio channel. Harder was in charge of activating the yellow lights around the track, and the in-car <b>dashboard</b> yellow <b>light</b> system.|$|R

50|$|Another {{field that}} uses {{this is the}} {{automotive}} industry. LEDs in the <b>dashboard</b> and instrument <b>lighting</b> are designed for use in mesopic luminance. In studies, {{it has been found}} that red LEDs appear brighter than green LEDs, which means that a driver would be able to see red light before the green lights when driving at night.|$|R
50|$|The {{cumulative}} visual {{changes from}} the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round side repeater indicators, major changes to the interior and <b>dashboard,</b> redesigned rear <b>light</b> lenses, and a radio aerial repositioned {{from the top of}} the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof, towards the rear.|$|R
50|$|Hutchison {{himself had}} a {{limousine}} custom-built in May 1908 to showcase {{the latest in}} automotive electrical technology. The Witherbee Igniter Company installed storage batteries that could be recharged from an on-board generator, or by plugging into a light socket. The car was equipped with three Klaxon horns and an external speaker to warn other traffic. An intercom similar to the dictograph allowed passengers {{to talk with the}} chauffeur. Many of the novel innovations in his vehicle are standard equipment today. Besides headlights with a dashboard switch, interior lamps lit automatically when doors were opened. The <b>dashboard</b> included <b>lighted</b> gauges, and alarms to indicate dangerous conditions. The car featured audible and visual back-up warning mechanisms.|$|R
2500|$|In {{distributive}} light systems, {{the light}} from a single source is sent via optical fibres or light guides to wherever it is needed in the automobile. Light guides are commonly used to distributively <b>light</b> <b>dashboard</b> displays, and premium vehicles are beginning to use distributive systems for lighting such items as door locks, window controls, and cup holders. [...] Distributive exterior lighting has also been explored, with high-intensity central light sources.|$|R
25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate a <b>dashboard</b> indicator <b>light</b> and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|R
