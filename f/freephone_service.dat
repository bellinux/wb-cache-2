50|$|In September 1994 Clear {{began to}} provide an 0800 <b>freephone</b> <b>service</b> in {{competition}} with Telecom. Prior to this, its <b>freephone</b> <b>service</b> had used the code 0508.|$|E
50|$|The {{numbering}} for the <b>freephone</b> <b>service</b> for {{the user}} making the call retains its 7 and 11 digit form, with the formats 800 XXXX and 800 XXXX XXXX.|$|E
50|$|A {{harmonised}} {{service of}} social value {{is a type}} of <b>freephone</b> <b>service</b> available in the European Union, which answers a specific social need, in particular which contributes to the well-being or safety of citizens, or particular groups of citizens, or helps citizens in difficulty. The phone numbers and the corresponding service descriptions are managed by the European Commission and harmonised across all EU member states. Harmonised services of social value use the prefix 116, which is then followed by three digits indicating the type of service.|$|E
50|$|Other codes had {{multiple}} uses over the years. Edinburgh stopped using 0500 {{and moved to}} 031 (0131 after PhONEday). Some years later, 0500 was used for Mercury <b>Freephone</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Oftel {{released}} 10-digit numbers beginning 0808 {{designated as}} <b>freephone</b> <b>services.</b> These calls are free {{only from a}} landline or public payphone.Both BT and Mercury issued only 10-digit freephone numbers to users after 1997. With the market opened up to competition, many other companies also allocated these numbers to users.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} {{freephone}} numbers could be accessed only by ringing the operator on 100 and {{asking to be}} connected, e.g. Freephone 8963 for BT customer service. Later on, the 0800 code came into use for <b>freephone</b> <b>services.</b> These numbers often had only 8 digits, e.g. 0800 1111 for ChildLine.|$|R
50|$|Universal International <b>Freephone</b> <b>Service</b> is an {{international}} service, assigned the country code 800 by the International Telecommunication Union. The intention is that any customer {{in the world can}} dial the same number to reach a business subscribing to a number, and at no charge to the calling party. However, {{only a limited number of}} countries yet participate. In order to participate, countries must agree on the amount of revenue they will retain (to cover their costs of network transport) while still forwarding sufficient revenue to cover the recipient's costs of subscribing.|$|E
40|$|The {{fight against}} Cork’s {{unlawful}} drugs trade has been dealt a blow, with {{the withdrawal of}} funding for a freephone initiative for the anonymous reporting of suspected drug dealing. ‘Dial To Stop Drug Dealing’ will be terminated from today (Friday), {{and it has been}} predicted that without services like it, the city’s drugs problem could be set to worsen. Sinn Féin’s Deputy Jonathan O’Brien was disappointed at the development given that the Gardaí had reported “substantial success in seizing drugs as a result of information received” via the line. Describing the service as a resource for tackling drug abuse, Deputy O’Brien said that the cost of the <b>freephone</b> <b>service</b> was “small compared to the potential benefits it offered communities and Gardaí”...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and suggests}} solutions {{to some of}} the technical problems and performance problems encountered when designing modeling, and evaluating a Service Control Point (SCP) architecture. The SCP is known as the "heart" of the Intelligent Network (IN). It is essentially a transaction processor-based computer system designed to execute IN services under stringent performance requirements and Quality of Service (QoS). Expected future problems for the SCP are mainly due to the introduction and increasing complexity of new, and already deployed IN services (e. g., <b>freephone</b> <b>service,</b> calling card service, televoting, virtual private network, universal access number, etc.). The challenges in designing the SCP architecture will involve issues such as performance, evaluation of the system, quality of service definition, estimating the capacity and delays/blocking, traffic rate measurements, availability, reliability, flow control, management activities, interworking, etc. We present and study an SCP architecture by means of queuing models and simulations. Our study differs from previous research as we consider in detail the internal SCP architecture. The proposed SCP architecture is designed as a multiprocessor-based system. It provides scalability while maintaining the requirements of the three most important performance metrics: SCP throughput, SCP response time and SCP call sampling rate. Scalability insures that IN services and SCP call sampling growth rates can be handled without impacting the performance of the SCP. The architecture also lends itself to discuss a multitude of performance and modeling issues such as service logic program storage, IN call processing activity, real-time traffic rate, main memory constraints, blocking probability, buffer dimensioning, bottleneck problems, management and administrative activities, statistical distributions, and specialized processors...|$|E
50|$|UIFS is {{analogous}} to intra-national toll free numbers such as 800 service in Canada and the United States, and <b>Freephone</b> <b>services</b> in most other countries. The +800 UIFN service {{is one of three}} ITU-administered non-geographic codes with a similar numbering scheme. The +808 Universal International Shared Cost Number (UISCN), billed at the price of a domestic call, shares the same eight-digit format; the +979 Universal International Premium Rate Number (UIPRN), billed at a high premium cost, carries one extra digit to indicate price range.|$|R
50|$|The 0500 {{range is}} used for some <b>freephone</b> <b>services</b> which were {{originally}} provided by Mercury Communications Ltd (now Cable & Wireless Worldwide). These numbers {{are different from the}} rest of the 05 range in that they are only 9 digits in length after the 0 trunk code, e.g. 0500 007 007 (NS&I, National Savings and Investments), 0500 2 88 2 91 (BBC Radio 2, 88 to 91 FM), 0500 600 600 (Crimewatch), 0500 600 700 (Watchdog), and 0500 909 693 (BBC Radio Five Live, 909 and 693 kHz). Numerous universities, government departments, airlines, banks and businesses also use these numbers. They were allocated before the general trend of using longer numbers started in 1997 and long before the rest of the 05 range was assigned to corporate and VoIP numbering after 2000.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{non-geographic number}} ranges {{might not be}} {{possible}} when calling from abroad of the United Kingdom. This is mostly {{the case with the}} 070 personal numbering range, the 080 <b>freephone</b> range and <b>service</b> numbers starting 084, 087, 090, 091 and 098.|$|R
40|$|Active {{competition}} in the telecommunications industry has caused a dramatic shift in focus for public network operators. Service designers {{need to be able}} to easily and rapidly create services according to the customer’s requirements. This is achievable by using Intelligent Networks (INs). Two primary goals of service development under the Intelligent Network paradigm are rapid service crcation using new software technologies and the minimisation of service development costs through switch vendor independence. This thesis examines the development of an IN architecture and the deployment of two call control services on it using the ITU-T Service Independent Building Block (SIB) methodology. The services are deployed on a narrow-band Excel switching platform. Various aspects of the IN Conceptual Model (INCM) are examined with a particular emphasis on the middle two planes: the Global Functional Plane (GFP) and the Distributed Functional Plane (DFP). Representations of these planes are designed using the ITU-T Specification and Description Language (SDL) [SDL 89] and implemented using Telelogic’s SDL Development Tool (SDT). SDL provides capabilities to allow logical structuring of the INCM into its constituent entities, the modelling of communication between these entities and the processing within them. The Intelligent Network paradigm was developed with a view to extendibility. Two call control services, Ringback and Group Call Pickup, are implemented using the SIB methodology. Further services may be created by rearranging the order of execution of the existing SIBs or, if necessary, by adding new SIBs to the architecture. Given the demand for multimedia applications to run on top of emerging broadband networks it is becoming increasingly more important for network operators to study the enhancement and evolution of their IN service platforms in order to cope with new customer requirements. TINA is the leading architecture for multimedia service control and delivery, which defines an emerging open service platform. Migration from IN to TINA is explored in this thesis by considering two individual paths of migration. The first path involves the replacement of the IN service control and management elements (SCF, SMF, SDF) with appropriate TINA Computational Objects while the switching elements (SSF, CCF) remain IN compliant. As there is no one-to-one mapping of IN functional entities to TINA computational objects, an Adaptation Unit is required to facilitate interaction between the legacy IN entities and the TINA Computational Objects. The advantage of this step is that it is possible to keep the investment of deployed IN SSPs while taking advantage of TINA service modelling. The second step involves the introduction of TINA into the switch. In this approach the switch and its switching capabilities may be viewed as a TINA object in itself. Interworking between IN and TINA (as a step towards full migration to TINA) yields a much richer service platform. This service platform facilitates the creation of services that incorporate both IN and TINA features. A TINA service may use pieces of IN functionality and IN services may also use TINA functionality. It is possible to invoke these hybrid services from either a PSTN or a TINA terminal. Three hybrid IN/TINA services were designed to demonstrate the increased resources available to the service designer using such a platform. A user connected to the IN switch invokes the <b>Freephone</b> <b>Service.</b> This service uses a TINA database to convert the 1 - 800 number to an extension number. The call is then connected using IN switching functionality. The Audio Video Conference, uses TINA computational objects to set up a video stream between participating users while the audio connection is handled by the IN switching functionality. This service is invoked from a TINA terminal. A user connected to the IN switch invokes the Ringback Service but it runs in the TINA domain using both TINA and IN functionality. Therefore, as well as presenting an application of the IN technology, this thesis proposes possible steps towards migration to the TINA architecture...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{there have been a}} {{revolution}} in the telecommunication scenario of the country. There are new services like paging, cellular, etc. Some private basic service operators have started providing service. Iridium is to soon launch satellite-based telephony service. There are IN services like universal number, <b>freephone,</b> premium call <b>services,</b> etc., which are being introduced. All these services require a common resource, that is, a number. Recently, there was a newspaper report suggesting that DoT and TRAI are considering an overhaul of the numbering plan for India. This paper considers another type of nodes that may have to be assigned numbers from the telephony address space (E. 164 numbers). With the growing interest in Internet telephony, and merger of data and voice networks, it is possible that in future users may like to receive calls on the PC they are working on. For this to happen, the PC should be addressable in the E. 164 domain. In this paper, we [...] ...|$|R
