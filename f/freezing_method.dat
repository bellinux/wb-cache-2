To freeze gelatin, the pressure-shift freez-ing (PSF) is being applied at 0. 1 (under atmospheric control), 50 and 100 MPa, respectively. The freezing point of gelatin solutions decrease with increasing gelatin concentrations, from- 0. 2 oC (10 % gelatin) to- 6. 7 oC (40 % gelatin), while the ex-tent of supercooling did not show any specific trends. The rheological properties of the gelatin indicate that both the storage (G') and loss (G") moduli were steady in the strain amplitude range of 0. 1 - 10 %. To characterize gelatin matrices formed by the various <b>freezing</b> <b>methods,</b> the ice crystal sizes which were being determined by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are affected by the gelatin concentrations.

Extenders (NaCl and glucose at 325 and 365 mOsm/kg), cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulfoxide = dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methyl glycol = methyl glycol (MG)), equilibration times (15 and 30 min), thawing temperatures (30 and 60 °C), and straw sizes (0. 5 and 4. 0 mL) were tested. Sperm were frozen in a liquid nitrogen vapor vessel at − 170 °C and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen. Post-thaw sperm quality was always evaluated in terms of motility (expressed as percentage of motile sperm), duration of motility and vitality (eosin-nigrosin staining, expressed as percentage of intact sperm).

40|$|With {{the cost}} of sludge {{management}} on the rise, the volume reduction of municipal wastewater sludge is becoming an increasingly important issue for wastewater treatment plants. Current research is focused on pretreatment methods intended {{to increase the efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion. Unfortunately, many of the pretreatment methods studied show little to no improvements in dewaterability of the secondary sludge. This research was carried out to investigate the potential of freezing and combined ultrasound-??freezing methods for simultaneous sludge pretreatment and conditioning. Three <b>methods</b> of <b>freezing</b> were employed; conventional freeze-??thaw (FT), combined ultrasonic-??freezing (UF) and progressive ultrasonic freezing (PUF). The solubilisation of sludge organic matter, evaluated by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), showed significant improvements for all <b>freezing</b> <b>methods</b> compared to the controls. The maximum increase in sCOD was 6. 5 times the control for conventional freezing at -?? 30 ?C and 5 freeze-??thaw cycles, 5. 3 times the control for combined ultrasonic freezing at 20 % amplitude and 12 minutes of sonication and 7. 7 times the control for the liquid portion of the progressive ultrasonic freezing samples with a three second sonication pulse {{for the duration of the}} freezing. The dewaterability of the <b>freezing</b> <b>methods</b> was also evaluated by measuring sludge volume index (SVI) and capillary suction time (CST). The three <b>freezing</b> <b>methods</b> showed significant improvements in dewaterability with CST ratios ranging from 0. 12 ? 0. 21 for conventional freezing, 0. 11 -?? 0. 21 for combined ultrasonic freezing and 0. 15 ? 0. 26 for the solid portion of the progressive ultrasonic freezing samples. The <b>freezing</b> <b>methods</b> were compared to three commonly studied pretreatment methods (thermal, microwave and ultrasound) and showed equivalent or better abilities to solubilise sludge organic matter and improve dewaterability. Further tests revealed that the three freezing treatments also resulted in significantly higher concentrations of proteins as well as increased biodegradability and gas production. The gas production ratio over the control was greatest for conventional freezing (1. 52), followed by combined ultrasonic freezing (1. 17) and progressive ultrasonic freezing (1. 13).

The field has seen much progress during its four-decade history, progress driven predominantly by research in humans.

Two basic cryopreservation techniques rule the field, slow-rate freezing, {{the first to be}} developed and vitrification which in recent years, has gained a foothold. The slow-rate <b>freezing</b> <b>method</b> previously reported had low survival and pregnancy rates, along with the high cost of cryopreservation. Although there are some recent data indicating better survival rates, cryopreservation by the slow <b>freezing</b> <b>method</b> has started to discontinue.

Moreover, oocyte cryopreservation using vitrification has been proposed as a solution to maintain women’s fertility by serving and freezing their oocytes at the optimal time. The aim of this research is to compare slow freezing and vitrification in cryopreservation of oocytes, zygotes, embryos and blastocysts during the last twelve years.

40|$|The {{melting point}} {{is one of the}} most {{fundamental}} and practically important properties of a compound. For this reason molecular simulation methods have been developed aiming towards accurate computation of melting points. Knowledge of the melting point before a compound has been synthesized could significantly accelerate the design of new materials. Generally, the molecular simulation methods developed so far for the computation of melting points are not fully predictive, since they require an experimental crystal structure as input. An interesting and challenging task is the prediction of the melting point of a compound from first principles- given just the molecular diagram. In this work, the concept of predicting the melting point of a given organic compound using as an input a computationally obtained crystal structure is investigated. To ensure reliable predictions, it is essential to develop an understanding of how the level of detail of the force fields in terms of crystal structure (CSP) prediction as well in melting point prediction affects the accuracy of the calculations. To explore these requirements the proposed approach in this work combines the application of a CSP multistage methodology developed by the Molecular Systems Engineering group at Imperial College and the <b>freeze</b> <b>method</b> which was recently developed in the group. Using the proposed approach, two different force fields are employed in this study. Initially, the <b>freeze</b> <b>method</b> is applied to the well known Lennard-Jones potential.
