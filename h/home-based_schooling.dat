AndersonParental school {{involvement}} {{is associated with}} positive social, psychological, and academic child outcomes. Beyond school, demographic, and individual influences, research is limited regarding the link between family-level processes and parental school involvement. Guided by family systems theory, this study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 1, 896) to examine the link between coparenting support and mothers’ and fathers’ <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> involvement and school-based school involvement when the child was nine years-old. Additionally, this study tested if parental union transitions (e. g., parental union dissolution; parental union formation; stably coresident relationship) significantly moderated these relationships. Latent variable structural equation modeling results revealed that higher levels of coparenting support was associated {{with higher levels of}} mothers’ and fathers’ <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> involvement, and higher levels of mothers’ and fathers’ school-based involvement. Union transition was not a significant moderator between coparenting support and mother and father home- and school-based school involvement...|$|R
40|$|This {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological research {{explored the}} lived experiences of six recently graduated adolescents to extrapolate the valued essence of their transitional encounters in changing from conventional <b>school</b> to <b>home-based</b> online <b>schooling.</b> The homeschool research shifted the emphasis from the outcome-based academic achievement studies prevalent {{during the past}} 20 years to a focus on internal and external factors impacting student learning within this technological instructional process. Findings produced from analysis and interpretation of reflective adolescent lived experiences revealed rich truth regarding the internal emotions, environmental adaptations, academic ramifications, and social adaptations encountered when changing from conventional <b>schooling</b> to <b>home-based</b> online <b>school.</b> Cognitive, maturational, and social skills showed reported gains in the move from conventional <b>school</b> to <b>home-based</b> online <b>school.</b> Gender differences were not reported as major contributing adjustment factors. The greatest transitional ramifications were noted by participants who made a geographic move while simultaneously enrolling in <b>home-based</b> online <b>school.</b> The magnitude of the loss in social capital was accentuated by the geographic move. Adolescent attitude in acceptance of the move was a defining element, leading to successful re-establishment of new social capital or resulting in social and psychological withdrawal...|$|R

50|$|The {{school was}} started in 2002 as a half day {{specialty}} school called Jefferson Parish School for Science and Technology (JPSST). Students attending {{public schools in the}} parish would enroll in JPSST - they would attend their <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> half a day and JPSST half a day - they were transported between their <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> and JPSST by bus daily to attend either the morning or afternoon session (morning transportation there or afternoon transportation home were arranged or provided by students' parents). Starting off with only two grades (7th and 8th), the school soon became a full day magnet school by the 2005 - 2006 school year and was renamed Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Academy (PFTSTA), after Patrick F. Taylor, an oil business tycoon famous for creating the TOPS program (which helps pays college tuition for students who attain a minimum GPA and ACT score). Patrick Taylor's widow, Ms. Taylor, continues to play a close {{role in the development of}} the school. At the time, the school included 6th - 9th grade and was located in the Jefferson Parish Public School System special services building, occupying the entire second floor of the building. On August 29, 2005, only a few weeks into the school year, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, causing evacuations and New Orleans school closures. Students were able to keep in touch with their teachers and one another via internet using the discussion forums set up on the school's eBoard. The rest of the 2005 - 2006 school year continued with a smaller amount of students, but still successfully.|$|R
40|$|The use of Goal Attainment Scaling to {{evaluate}} a home-based educational intervention in which parents acted as tutors of their own elementary-school-aged children is described. Goal Attainment Scaling is a mOdel originally developed for the National Institutes of Mental Health as a-;eans of evaluating the activities of community pental health centers. As adapted {{for use in a}} public school setting, Goal Attainment Scaling proved to be a iiseful. tool in not only determining program outcomes, but in also providing a standard for program decisions in a school environment characterized by flux and shifting frames of reference. How program goals were scaled, scored, and interpreted using the Goal Attainment Scaling procedure are discussed. It was concluded that the Margaret Sheehy School Parent Outreach Program was,successful in establishing a cost-effective <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> program focusing on both academic and related needs of referred children.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this research is to develop an integrated land-use/transportation model to represent the interrelationships between land use and transportation, subject to the requirements of the ISTEA of 1991 and the CAAA of 1990. The integrated model includes two major parts: a land-use allocation module and a travel demand module. Interface modules have also been built to transform data between these two modules. The land-use allocation module consists of a residential location model, an employment location model, a land use potential model, and a land consumption model. One unique feature of the residential and employment location models is that they simultaneously estimate passenger movement by work-to-home, home-to-shop and work-to-shop trips between zones before entering the travel demand module. Then the TRANPLAN-based travel demand module carries out trip generation and trip distribution stages for estimating <b>home-based</b> <b>school,</b> <b>home-based</b> other, non-home-based, external-internal and external-external trips. The land consumption model, which is significantly different from the LANCON procedure of DRAM/EMPAL, based on micro-economic theory can simulate the profit-maximizing behavior of housing or land owners over time. The major purpose of the land consumption model is to satisfy the need to reach a balance between demand and supply in the housing market during each time period. The land consumption model is also influenced by Anas 2 ̆ 7 s work in CATLAS, which did not deal with employment location, and simultaneously considers housing location and employment location. The integrated model can be used to evaluate land use policies and transportation policies. Tests run for the Lafayette area have demonstrated that the model can be used to quantify positive and negative effects of long range transportation and land use plans. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} effect of residential gravity accessibility by automobile to all employment in the Atlanta metropolitan region on the quantity and nature of travel by men and women. The literature suggests that greater accessibility of residential locations is associated with more, but shorter trips, resulting in less travel. Using the Atlanta Regional Commission’s 1990 Household Travel Survey, I evaluated household and personal travel behavior and found: (1) individuals and households who live in more accessible portions of the metropolitan area spend significantly fewer minutes in travel; (2) among individuals this effect is seen primarily for employed men; (3) residential accessibility’s effect on numbers of motorized trips is ambiguous and often insignificant, though students who were not employed and lived in more accessible locations made significantly fewer <b>home-based</b> <b>school</b> trips by motorized vehicle. These results demonstrate that residential accessibility does affect travel, reinforcing the belief that land use policy and physical planning to improve accessibility may provide means of manipulating travel demand to achieve higher quality of life, enhanced economic development and more efficient transportation. However, some planning policies aimed at least partly at increasing accessibility (zoning for higher densities, fostering mixed uses, achieving jobs-housing balance) can be costly, unpopular, or both. This research also demonstrates that residential accessibility’s effects on travel, though significant, do not affect everyone, suggesting {{they may not be}} worth large sacrifices. Fi-nally, though these effects are significant, and gravity measures of accessibility may help transporta-tion planners predict the results of planned and unplanned changes when used with other information, they do not predict travel behavior well when used alone...|$|R

It was developed in the 1960s through research at the University of Kansas. Researchers included Montrose Wolf, PhD (the inventor of time-out as a learning tool to shape behavior) and Gary Timbers, PhD. The model has been replicated over 800 times, although not all of the replications have proven effective and successful.|$|R

As a result, there is a need to plan for training of a sufficient number of competent behaviour analytic practitioners to meet the growing demand.

40|$|<b>Home-based</b> {{reinforcement}} of <b>school</b> behavior {{is proving to}} be an efficient method for motivating behavioral change. It has been used successfully with children in group homes, with children in special classes, and with entire mainstream and special classrooms. Twenty-four studies are reviewed with particular attention given to types of consequences employed and methods of gaining parental involvement. Consumable reinforeers, earned privileges, ver-bal praise, and response costs were all effectively administered by parents who were informed of their children's performance via daily or weekly school notes. Parents were instructed in their role in several ways, including group and individual conferences as well as simple letters sent home. A wide range of behaviors and academic problems were remedied rapidly and with a modicum of response costs to counselors, teachers, and parents. Implications for further research are considered. It has been demonstrated frequently and incontrovertibly that classroom behavior can be controlled by teachers who are trained in the use of differential reinforcement and token economies (CTLeary & Becker, 1967; Walker & Buckley, 1972). Teachers have learned to use behavioral principles to increase their effectiveness in dealing with problematic behavior in mainstream classes (Barrish, Sanders, & Wolf, 1969...|$|R
