5|$|Zinc {{burns in}} {{air with a}} bright bluish-green flame, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room {{temperature}} with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|In early 1979, Des Moines fire {{officials}} {{announced that a}} hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store's heating and cooling system caused the fire. Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused wires that were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> hydrochloric acid. Lawyers representing Younkers and {{the families of the}} eleven victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride, including Monsanto Company and Underwriters Laboratories.

5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools.

5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought {{it might have been}} a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E
5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} nervus trigeminus of Mabuya quinquetaeniata. The {{results showed that the}} nervus trigeminus has one root, and two {{separate}} ganglia, a maxillomandibular ganglion and an ophthalmic one. The maxillomandibular ganglion is continuous with the ophthalmic ganglion. The lateral part of the ventromedial division of the trigeminal root <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the anguli oris nerve and nerves to the adductor mandibularis externus and the pseudotemporalis muscles. The constrictor dorsalis nerve innervates the protractor pterygoideus, levator pterygoideus, and depressor palpbrae inferioris muscles. It has no anastomosis with ramus palatinus of the nervus facialis. The ramus frontalis is connected with the lacrimal plexus. The ramus nasalis anastomoses with the ethmoidal ganglion and divides into its to rami lateralis and medialis nasi within the nasal capsule. The ramus maxillaris <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> lacrimal and temporal branches in the postorbital region. In the orbital region, it is termed infraorbital nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a nerve to the Harderian gland, the supralabial gland and the upper teeth. It fuses with the ramus palatinus lateralis of the nervus facialis. It receives an anastomosing branch from the ramus palatines medialis and fuses with the ramus palatines intermedialis for a short distance. It carries ganglionic cells at the point of fusion.

5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash.

The transports {{had been coming}} {{to the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø.

25|$|Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), {{also known}} as fish odor {{syndrome}} or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). When FMO3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, <b>giving</b> <b>off</b> a strong fishy odor or strong body odor. A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists {{where there is no}} genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.|$|E
