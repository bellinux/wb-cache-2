2500|$|The church {{continued}} {{to serve the}} parish despite its isolation, but it declined into a poor structural state by the mid-19th century: in 1834 it was described as [...] "in such a general state of decay as to make any attempt to repair it inadvisable". [...] Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb (no relation to the writer Charles Lamb), who lived at Beauport Park, a nearby mansion, wanted the church to be closed and a replacement built nearer his land, but parishioners demanded that the ancient church be repaired instead. [...] Work started in 1847 and continued for nearly 20 years: the church closed {{for a time in}} 1861 while repairs were made, then Matilda <b>Dampner</b> paid for a complete restoration in 1865 to commemorate her parents. [...] The church closed again while this was carried out, and reopened in 1866. [...] The renovation was so substantial that it gave the church a mostly Victorian appearance, and only a few fragments of Norman-era fabric remained.|$|E
5000|$|When {{detailed}} geological investigations {{were carried}} out by Geologists from the US and Britain, their finding was a <b>dampner</b> {{to the development of}} the mines in the hill. They inferred that the ores found were mere deposits only and not sourced by ore bearing veins in the rocks which could produce mineral ore for a long period. This revelation coupled with miners strikes and bad weather conditions resulted in a mass exodus of people, in 1870, from the mining belt.|$|E
50|$|Several {{examples}} of free-standing top-hung sliding-door wardrobes {{can be seen}} on several websites. The mechanisms are safe, and the bottom of the doors is held in place on tracks. The rollers also have safety locks that prevent the doors from jumping off the tracks. Additional features such as soft closers or <b>dampners</b> can be added to further enhance the feel and usability of these products.|$|R
50|$|In The Dark Knight Returns, which Batman {{initially}} {{goes into}} action wearing the standard Batsuit, he dons {{a suit of}} powered armour when facing Superman. Features of this suit include an ultrasonic gun- along with sonic <b>dampners</b> to prevent Batman being damaged by the same weapon- {{and the ability to}} plug directly into Gotham's power grid by connecting the suit to a lamp in Crime Alley. The suit itself is also powerful enough to do some damage to Superman in a fight, but this required Batman to confront Superman at night after he had been hit with various other weapons, such as missiles from the Batmobile and an arrow of synthetic kryptonite. Three years later (The Dark Knight Strikes Again), Batman has returned to his original suit with a completely black cape and cowl, the cape's edges being so sharp that he is able to use them to carve a 'Z' onto Lex Luthor's face.|$|R
