5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis</b> (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emesis</b> (i.e. {{induced by}} ipecac) {{is no longer}} {{recommended}} in poisoning situations, because vomiting is ineffective at removing poisons.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is used in}} {{veterinary medicine}} as emesis-causing agent. It is given as warm saturated solution. <b>Emesis</b> can also be caused by pharyngeal placement of small amount of plain salt or salt crystals.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonist (ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron, and tropisetron) {{have been}} the most important drugs in antiemetic therapy for emetogenic chemotherapy. They are especially effective in treating acute <b>emesis,</b> occurring in the first 24 hours following chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Endocannabinoids are eicosanoids {{acting as}} {{agonists}} for cannabinoid receptors and they occur naturally in the body. Cannabinoid receptor-related processes are for example involved in cognition, memory, anxiety, control of appetite, <b>emesis,</b> motor behavior, sensory, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses, immune responses and inflammatory effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the possible in-flight performance and motor skill changes that were described above, the immediate CNS effects (i.e., within 24 hours following exposure to low-LET radiation) are anorexia and nausea. These prodromal risks are dose-dependent and, as such, can provide {{an indicator of the}} exposure dose. Estimates are ED50 = 1.08 Gy for anorexia, ED50 = 1.58 Gy for nausea, and ED50=2.40 Gy for <b>emesis.</b> The relative effectiveness of different radiation types in producing <b>emesis</b> was studied in ferrets and is illustrated in figure 6-7. High-LET radiation at doses that are below 0.5 Gy show greater relative biological effectiveness compared to low-LET radiation. The acute effects on the CNS, which are associated with increases in cytokines and chemokines, may lead to disruption in the proliferation of stem cells or memory loss that may contribute to other degenerative diseases.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{overdosage}} {{is often}} manifested by <b>emesis,</b> lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or {{to aid in the}} medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low.|$|E
25|$|One such {{effect is}} <b>emesis.</b> This effect is felt {{in cases of}} food poisoning, when SAg-producing {{bacteria}} release the toxin, which is highly resistant to heat. There is a distinct region of the molecule that is active in inducing gastrointestinal toxicity. This activity is also highly potent, and quantities as small as 20-35μg of SAg are able to induce vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Initially, gastric {{decontamination}} of {{the patient}} is achieved by administering, either orally or via a nasogastric tube, activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion). Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or (ipecac induced) <b>emesis,</b> are not recommended in TCA poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Rhône-Poulenc {{licensed}} chlorpromazine to Smith Kline & French (today's GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it {{was approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of <b>emesis</b> (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin and infectious diseases. But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From chlorpromazine a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive <b>emesis,</b> though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{is merely}} {{symptomatic}} and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of <b>emesis,</b> gastric lavage, {{and the use}} of activated charcoal can all be tried. Epinephrine is avoided for treatment of hypotension and shock, because its action might be reversed. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocryptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not usually}} fatal when taken alone, a {{diazepam}} overdose {{is considered a}} medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil (Anexate). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug, {{and the effects of}} diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. Artificial respiration and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Though not routinely indicated, activated charcoal can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. <b>Emesis</b> is contraindicated. Dialysis is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with levarterenol or metaraminol.|$|E
25|$|The 5-HT3 receptors {{are present}} in several {{critical}} sites involved in <b>emesis,</b> including vagal afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT3 receptors. The highest concentration of 5-HT3 receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are found in the STN and chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and 5-HT3 antagonists may also suppress vomiting and nausea by acting at these sites. The 5-HT3 antagonists are greatly selective and have little affinity for other receptors, such as dopamine, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1978, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) - a major charity {{supporting}} cancer {{research in the}} United Kingdom at the time, decided to provide an £800,000 endowment to support creation of a Chair of Medical Oncology in the Faculty of Medicine in Edinburgh. Following an open competition, the University of Edinburgh appointed John F. Smyth (at the time a senior lecturer in medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London) for that position on 1 April 1979. After a short visit to the University of Chicago, professor Smyth assumed his duties in Edinburgh on 1 October 1979 (a date that {{can be considered as}} the beginning of the Centre). Soon afterwards, additional posts were provided by the University and matched by appropriate staff positions by Lothian Health Board (NHS) to create first clinical service for medical oncology in Edinburgh. The service was based in the Western General Hospital where some beds and out-patient facilities were provided. In 1980 it was formally recognized as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit in Edinburgh with professor John Smyth as its director. This resulted in additional funding that allowed building of a small research laboratory which was commissioned in 1981. The laboratory was located in a portable cabin on the Western General Hospital campus. The main focus of the Unit was the development of more successful drug therapies for all forms of cancer and looking for new ways of reducing the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. With generous support from Imperial Cancer Research Fund and other organisations, the Unit was steadily growing enabling clinical trials for promising anticancer therapeutics. For example, the Unit was responsible for the very first clinical trial of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, heralding in the dramatic changes in <b>emesis</b> control that subsequently followed the development of that class of compounds. In 1984 the Unit moved to a new location at {{the top floor of the}} MRC Human Genetics Unit building which allowed for expansion of laboratory research activities. After a successful ICRF review in 1996, it had been recognized that further extension of scientific activities of the Unit required even more space and prof. Smyth obtained permission to rise funds to create a new purpose designed building. The work started in 2000 and the new £7M building was officially opened in 2002 by The Princess Royal. It provides 3000 square meters of gross internal space and is a current base for majority of ECRC researchers. At that time (in 2002), following reorganisation of faculties into schools within the University of Edinburgh, the name Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was created and used with reference to the Unit and the new building. In 2004 the successor of ICRF, Cancer Research UK, also started to refer to the Unit as the CRUK Clinical Cancer Centre to emphasize its status as a comprehensive cancer centre. In 2007 ECRC became part of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. In 2010, following a successful bid, ECRC has been formally recognized as Cancer Research UK Centre and is known as Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe godeyi flesh has {{a strong}} smell, which has been {{variously}} described as [...] "unpleasant", [...] "earthy or mealy", and [...] "not distinctive". The flesh has an acrid taste. The mushrooms {{are known to be}} poisonous, containing toxic compounds of muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis</b> (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe cookei {{has been}} {{described}} as both poisonous (due to the presence of muscarine compounds) and non-toxic. Consumption of mushrooms containing muscarine compounds could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrolled urination or defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis</b> (vomiting); this array of symptoms may also be known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure. The flesh of the mushroom has a mild taste and a slight smell of honey. Regardless of its actual toxicity or edibility, it is considered [...] "best avoided".|$|E
500|$|The {{species has}} a mild, indistinct taste, and a faint smell of flour. Mycologist Roger Phillips {{describes}} its edibility as [...] "suspect", recommending {{that it be}} avoided, and notes {{that it is possible}} that the species is poisonous; most species of Inocybe have been shown to contain poisonous chemicals. Mycologist Ian Robert Hall lists the mushroom as containing the poisonous compound muscarine. Consumption of muscarine could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrollable urination and defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis</b> (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE.

2500|$|Dopamine receptors control neural {{signaling}} that modulates many important behaviors, such as spatial working memory. [...] Dopamine also {{plays an important}} role in the reward system, incentive salience, cognition, prolactin release, <b>emesis</b> and motor function.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperemesis gravidarum is {{from the}} Greek hyper-, meaning excessive, and <b>emesis,</b> meaning vomiting, and the Latin gravidarum, the {{feminine}} genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning [...] "pregnant [...] ". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means [...] "excessive vomiting of pregnant women".|$|E
2500|$|Other seizure types: [...] Despite {{prominent}} hypersalivation, focal seizures with primarily autonomic manifestations (autonomic seizures) are {{not considered}} part of the core clinical syndrome of Rolandic epilepsy. [...] However, some children may present with independent autonomic seizures or seizures with mixed Rolandic-autonomic manifestations including <b>emesis</b> as in Panayiotopoulos syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the initial}} signs are those {{associated}} to the anticholinergic effects of TCAs such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, dizziness, and <b>emesis</b> (or vomiting). Due {{to the location of}} norepinephrine receptors all over the body, many physical signs are also associated with a TCA overdose: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists {{was a dramatic}} improvement {{in the treatment of}} nausea and vomiting. [...] Ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron and palonosetron are currently approved in the United States, and form the cornerstone of therapy for the control of acute <b>emesis</b> with chemotherapy agents with moderate to high emetogenic potential.|$|E
2500|$|Atropine {{is given}} as a {{treatment}} for SLUDGE syndrome (salivation, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis, gastrointestinal motility, <b>emesis)</b> symptoms caused by organophosphate poisoning. [...] Another mnemonic is DUMBBELSS, which stands for diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, excitation (as of muscle in the form of fasciculations and CNS), lacrimation, salivation, and sweating (only sympathetic innervation using muscarinic receptors).|$|E
2500|$|Should an {{overdose}} occur, the patient {{should be treated}} symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. [...] If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by <b>emesis</b> or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. [...] A Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up-to-date information on management of overdose with ZYFLO CR.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{apomorphine}} {{has been}} tried {{for a variety of}} uses including psychiatric treatment of homosexuality in the early 20th century, and more recently in treating erectile dysfunction. Currently, apomorphine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a potent emetic (i.e., it induces vomiting) and should not be administered without an antiemetic such as domperidone. [...] The emetic properties of apomorphine are exploited in veterinary medicine to induce therapeutic <b>emesis</b> in canines that have recently ingested toxic or foreign substances.|$|E
2500|$|Aprepitant {{has been}} shown to inhibit both the acute and delayed <b>emesis</b> induced by {{cytotoxic}} chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brain's neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies, have demonstrated that aprepitant can cross the blood brain barrier and bind to NK1 receptors in the human brain. [...] It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Case 5. This case {{involved}} seizures manifesting mainly with syncope-like epileptic seizures without <b>emesis.</b> [...] A 7-year-old boy had from 5 {{years of age}} approximately 12 episodes of collapse at school. All episodes were stereotyped but of variable duration from 2 to 35 minutes. While standing or sitting, he slumped forwards and fell on his desk or the floor and became unresponsive as if in “deep sleep.” There were no convulsions or other discernible ictal or postictal symptoms.Four EEGs consistently showed frequent multifocal spikes predominating in the frontal regions.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera has mild-tasting {{flesh and}} a mild, mealy smell. The North American variety I.lacera var. heterosperma has a [...] smell. However, species of Inocybe {{should always be}} avoided when {{choosing}} mushrooms for consumption, {{as many of the}} members of the genus are dangerously toxic. I. lacera is known to be poisonous, containing quantities of the toxic compound muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom typically leads to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis</b> (vomiting), which has given rise to the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due respiratory failure.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera (commonly {{known as}} the torn fibrecap) is a {{poisonous}} species of mushroom in the genus Inocybe. Its appearance {{is that of a}} typical [...] "little brown mushroom": small, brown and indistinct. However, it is distinguishable by its microscopic features, particularly its long, smooth spores. As with many other species of Inocybe, I.lacera contains the poisonous chemical muscarine which, if consumed, can lead to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and <b>emesis.</b> Found in Europe and North America, it typically grows in autumn in mixed woods, favouring sandy soil. There are several documented subspecies in addition to the main I.lacera var lacera, including the dwarf form I.lacera var. subsquarrosa and I.lacera var. heterosperma, found in North America.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Emesis</b> (induction of vomiting) is the {{generally}} recommended treatment if a dog has eaten grapes or raisins {{within the past}} two hours. A veterinarian may use an emetic such as [...] apomorphine to cause the dog to vomit. Further treatment may involve the use of activated charcoal to adsorb remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluid therapy in the first 48 hours following ingestion to induce diuresis and help to prevent acute renal failure. Vomiting is treated with antiemetics and the stomach is protected from uremic gastritis (damage to the stomach from increased BUN) with H2 receptor antagonists. BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium levels are closely monitored. Dialysis of the blood (hemodialysis) and peritoneal dialysis {{can be used to}} support the kidneys if anuria develops. Oliguria (decreased urine production) can be treated with dopamine or furosemide to stimulate urine production.|$|E
2500|$|Case 6. [...] This case also {{illustrates}} {{the features of}} syncope-like epileptic seizures together with other variable autonomic symptoms (<b>emesis,</b> respiratory abnormalities, pallor, mydriasis) in Panayiotopoulos syndrome. A 5-year-old boy at age 13 months woke up vomiting profusely and then, {{while he was still}} in bed, became unresponsive and floppy with shallow breathing for 20 minutes. Later the same night, he woke up, vomited, and then collapsed in the bath. He remained flaccid and unresponsive for 1 hour, and his mother, described him as “flat” and pale with dilated nonreactive pupils. At age 20 months, he collapsed on the floor pale, unresponsive, and flaccid for approximately 10 minutes. On another occasion, he was found in bed unresponsive, floppy, and pale for 5 minutes. The last seizure occurred at age 28 months in the nursery. He fell on the floor and remained unresponsive and flaccid for 20 minutes and then he rapidly recovered. EEGs consistently showed multifocal spikes in various brain locations. Cardiologic assessment was normal.|$|E
