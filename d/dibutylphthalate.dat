40|$|Micrococcus sp. strain 12 B was {{isolated}} by enriching for growth with <b>dibutylphthalate</b> {{as the sole}} carbon and energy source. A pathway for the metabolism of <b>dibutylphthalate</b> and phthalate by micrococcus sp. strain 12 B is proposed: <b>dibutylphthalate</b> leads to monobutylphthalate leads to phthalate leads to 3, 4 -dihydro- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphthalate leads to 3, 4 -dihydroxyphthalate leads to protocatechuate (3, 4 -dihdroxybenzoate). Protocatechuate is metabolized both by the meta-cleavage pathway through 4 -carboxy- 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde and 4 -carboxy- 2 -hydroxymuconate to pyruvate and oxaloacetate and by the ortho-cleavage pathway to beta-ketoadipate. Dibutylphthalate- and phthalate-grown cells readily oxidized <b>dibutylphthalate,</b> phthalate, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphthalate, and protocatechuate. Extracts of cells grown with <b>dibutylphthalate</b> or phthalate contained the 3, 4 -dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase and the enzymes of the protocatechuater 4, 5 -meta-cleavage pathway. Extracts of dibutylphthalate-grown cells also contained the protocatechuate ortho-cleavage pathway enzymes. The dibutylphthalate-hydrolyzing esterase and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase were constitutively synthesized; phthalate- 3, 4 -dioxygenase (and possibly the "dihydrodiol" dehydrogenase) was inducible by phthalate or a metabolite occurring before protocatechuate in the pathway; two protocatechuate oxygenases and subsequent enzymes were inducible by protocatechuate or a subsequent metabolic product. During growth at 37 degrees C, strain 12 B gave clones at high frequency that had {{lost the ability to}} grow with phthalate esters. One of these nonrevertible mutants, strain 12 B-Cl, lacked all of the enzymes required for the metabolism of <b>dibutylphthalate</b> through the protocatechuate meta-cleavage pathway.

Three organic solvents, hexadecane, decanol, and <b>dibutylphthalate,</b> were tested at 5 - 20 % (v/v) in the culture liquid. All of these solvents stimulated taxol release and the yield per cell, though decanol and higher concentrations of the other two solvents depressed biomass growth significantly. Ten percent <b>dibutylphthalate</b> was the optimal solvent for improving taxol production and release with minimal cell growth inhibition. The time of solvent addition to the culture also affected taxol production, with the addition during the late-log growth phase being most favorable. By feeding sucrose to the culture near the stationary growth phase, the cell growth and taxol production period was extended from 27 to 42 days.

The merit parameters of the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector method were weighed against a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-single ion monitoring method of endocrine disrupting compounds analysis. The compounds were evaluated over a concentration range of 0. 2 to 6. 0 &# 181;g L- 1. The use of a two-dimensional chromatography method proved to be advantageous in analysing endocrine disrupting compounds, according to the observed increase of the signal relative to the noise and peak resolution...|$|E
40|$|Dental implant is a {{pharmaceutical}} device {{in the form}} of strip with very small loading and size of 0. 25 sq cm. For site-specific one-time continuous delivery of ornidazole an antimicrobial compound with excellent activity against anaerobic micro-organism in the treatment of periodontal disease was prepared by solvent casting technique using ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K 4 M and Eudragit RL- 100 with <b>dibutylphthalate</b> as plasticizer. The physicochemical parameters like thickness, weight variation, content uniformity and release characteristics were evaluated The drug release was initially high on day one to achieve immediate therapeutic level of drug in pocket, followed by marked fall in release by day two, and progressive moderate release profile to maintain therapeutic level following anomalous transport mechanism. Formulation V 6 released 97. 07 &#x 0025; of drug at the end of 120 h and was considered as best formulation. In vitro antibacterial activity was carried out on Streptococcus mutans...|$|E
40|$|In {{the risk}} {{assessment}} methods {{for new and}} existing chemicals in the EU, "risk" is characterised {{by means of the}} deterministic quotient of exposure and effects (PEC/PNEC or Margin of Safety). From a scientific viewpoint, the uncertainty in the risk quotient should be accounted for explicitly in the decision making. The advantages and disadvantages of probabilistic risk assessment in this legal framework have been extensively discussed in earlier work. To demonstrate the benefits of a probabilistic risk framework, example assessments for two substances are presented in this report: <b>dibutylphthalate</b> (DBP, an existing chemical) and a new chemical notification. The worked-out examples show that a probabilistic risk framework is feasible with relatively little extra effort and provides more relevant information. The deterministic risk quotients turned out to be quite worst case; generally higher than the 95 th percentile of the probability distributions. Sensitivity analysis proves to be a powerful tool to identify the main sources of uncertainty and thus for efficient further testing...|$|E
