5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} comprises {{at least}} two known subspecies; one is the nominate subspecies Laevistrombus canarium canarium, {{and the other is}} Laevistrombus canarium guidoi. L.canarium guidoi distinguishes <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other subspecies by its solid white colour, the outline of the posterior canal and a more prominent posteriorly protruding outer lip. The presence of a freely protruding lip at the posterior portion of the columella is also a distinctive character.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in 2009 led to Church of Scientology-owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology. The Church of Scientology {{has long had}} a controversial history on the Internet, and has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical of <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> web. From early in Wikipedia's history, conflict arose within the topic of Scientology on the website. Disputes began in earnest in 2005, with users disagreeing {{about whether or not}} to describe Scientology as an abusive cult or religion. By 2006, disagreements concerning the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia had grown more specific. Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts.|$|E

5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} to the 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired {{the rights to}} the character. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2003 film and establish its own identity, although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to complete the film.|$|E
5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, {{ignorant of the}} complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, {{the ideas of the}} union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarcho-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beginning}} {{during the}} events of , the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, {{the events of}} Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 (as well as the latter title's two updates). The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change {{the aftermath of the}} events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat {{at the hands of the}} evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} autumn 2007, long-rage {{forecast}} models {{indicated that a}} La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation phase took shape, leading {{to the development of}} Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28December. Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg). This strengthening was short-lived as wind shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.|$|E

The state also intended on improving an extension of the roadway east to 76 Road and 76 Road <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> modern junction of Boiceville, Valley, and Central Chapel Roads south to Speedsville; however, construction advanced no farther southeastward than Guide Board Corners.

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep {{convection}} consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation and convective banding features developed along {{the periphery of the}} system. Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E

Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members.

5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E
5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to Boys in the Sand. In 1984, they finally shot Boys in the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available.

5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Debby encountered {{an area of}} dry air, and subsequently weakened. The low level circulation detached <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diminishing convection while {{the system as a}} whole continued west-northwestward. Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center, while banding features redeveloped as well. Organization continued, and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on August 24. Southerly wind shear displaced the convection {{to the north of the}} center, and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25. The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated, and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression. Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned to the north and north-northeast ahead of an approaching trough, and on August 28 the low dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Burnside, a local {{government}} {{area in the}} metropolitan area of Adelaide, South Australia, spans three centuries. Burnside was inhabited by the Kaurna Indigenous people prior to European settlement, living around the creeks of the River Torrens during the winter and in the Adelaide Hills during the summer. The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a Scots migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in Scots, 'Burn' means creek or stream). The village of Burnside was established shortly after, and the District Council of Burnside was gazetted in 1856, separating <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> larger East Torrens Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the system was a cold front that moved off the U.S. East Coast on September 11.

Over the next two days, the cloud cover slowly detached <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front and form into a tropical low in its own right. On the afternoon of September 17, the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four.|$|E
