5|$|To {{serve the}} {{expected}} demand of the expansion, the DHO {{built a new}} four lane freeway north from Highway401 at Renforth <b>Drive.</b> <b>This</b> new route, which roughly followed the same route as Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Road, {{was known as the}} Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964.|$|E
5|$|At San Diego, Manning {{threw for}} 255 yards, two touchdowns, and one {{interception}} in a 23–20 victory. The interception snapped a career-best streak of 140 pass attempts without an interception. After the Chargers rallied from a 10-point {{deficit in the}} fourth quarter to tie the game, Manning led the game-winning drive by completing a 14-yard pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th and inches at midfield. Adam Vinateri kicked the winning 51-yard field goal three plays later. It was Manning's 5th game-winning <b>drive</b> <b>this</b> season. Manning passed for a season-low 125 yards at Cleveland, but the Colts won their 5th straight game, by a final of 10–6.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to <b>drive</b> <b>this</b> electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E

5|$|NY240 {{continues}} north through Amherst as a two-lane residential boulevard {{with the}} Harlem Road moniker. The route remains residential for several blocks, intersecting with NY5 (Main Street). Passing {{east of the}} hamlet of Snyder, NY240 passes several commercial businesses before becoming residential again north of that junction. The route remains residential for a distance to the intersection with Campus Lane, where it enters exit6 of I-290 (the Youngmann Expressway). A block {{to the north of}} I-290, NY240 intersects with NY324 (Sheridan <b>Drive).</b> <b>This</b> intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY240.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a <b>drive.</b> <b>This</b> limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their <b>drive.</b> <b>This</b> does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of the iMac series of Macintoshes, the {{firmware}} was updated. The ROM was reduced in size to 1MB, called BootROM, and the remainder of the ROM was moved to the file Mac OS ROM in the Mac OS System Folder, stored on the hard <b>drive.</b> <b>This</b> ROM used a full implementation of the OpenFirmware standard (contained in BootROM) and was named the New World ROM.|$|E
5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves {{open the possibility that}} he may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may have been able to call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment <b>drive.</b> <b>This</b> would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{opened the}} 2006 season against his brother Eli's New York Giants on Sunday Night Football. It {{was the first}} NFL game with {{starting}} quarterbacks that were brothers, and Peyton's team won 26–21. Manning passed for 400 yards against the Texans in a 43–24 victory, which earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors (he also won the award for his 345 yards and four touchdown passes against the Redskins in Week 7). A second trip to New Jersey, this time to play the Jets, produced another Colts win. After taking the lead twice in the fourth quarter, Manning had to lead a third scoring <b>drive,</b> <b>this</b> time finishing with a one-yard quarterback sneak rushing touchdown in the last minute for a 31–28 win.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{over after}} the missed field goal, Georgia Tech {{was unable to}} gain a first down. After the Yellow Jackets punted the ball away, Wake Forest {{continued}} to have the increased offensive success they had shown in their previous <b>drive.</b> <b>This</b> time, it was running back Kenneth Moore who picked {{up the majority of}} the Deacons' yardage, as he carried the ball eight times during the drive. Toward the end of the drive, Wake Forest was assisted by a 10-yard penalty against the Yellow Jackets, which drove them inside Georgia Tech's red zone. There, however, Tech's defense stiffened. Despite having a first down at Tech's 10-yard line, Wake was unable to score a touchdown. Kicker Sam Swank again came into the game to attempt a field goal, and connected on a 19-yard field goal. The kick tied the score at 33 with just 58 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The Midshipmen {{began the}} second quarter with a two-play, 30-second drive that ended with a 61-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Polanco to receiver Corey Dryden, increasing the team's lead to 21–7. The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back Rodney Ferguson, but kicker Wes Zunker's extra point attempt was no good, making the score 21–13. Midshipmen kicker Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24–13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off another long <b>drive,</b> <b>this</b> time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's two-point conversion attempt failed. Lane Jackson intercepted McKamey's pass on the Lobos final drive before half-time, ending {{the first half of}} the game with a score of 24–19 in favor of the Midshipmen.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore <b>Drive.</b> <b>This</b> location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E

5|$|The {{victim of}} poor field position, Ball State {{executed}} only three plays, {{the last of}} which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. They got on the score board on that drive via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7–3 Ball State. On their ensuing drive, Ball State executed another extended <b>drive,</b> <b>this</b> one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10–10.|$|E
