40|$|International audienceHigh Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is a {{replacement}} of the existing Alternating Current (HVAC) solutions for the transport of electricity using underwater cables. An example is the connexion of off-shore wind turbines to the electrical network. The main consequence of chosing HVDC over HVAC {{is the need for}} large power electronic converters in place of standard low-frequency transformers. Here, we describe the system-level design of a 5 MW convert intended for HVDC connexion of large wind turbines. This converter is based on high voltage SiC transistors, which have a strong sensitivity to their junction temperature. Indeed, their on-state resistance is more than doubled between 25 and 125 °C. Although these devices are, in theory, capable to operate at higher junction temperature than silicon IGBTs, doing so results in a large drop in the efficiency of the converter. Here, we present the many parameters that {{must be taken into account}} for the thermal design of such a large converter: the cost and performance of the dies (including their variation of R DS on with temperature), the cost and performance of the cooling system and of the packaging (taking into consideration the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>isolation</b> requirements), the mission profile of the wind turbine, the price of electricity.

40|$|In the paper, a {{combined}} numerical-experimental approach for {{the prediction of}} the activity of different peroxides at different vulcanization temperatures for EPM-EPDM rubber curing is proposed. Several experimental tests were conducted on the same recipe of an EPDM elastomer used in industry for medium and <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>isolation</b> cables, changing both peroxides used and controlled vulcanization temperature. In particular, test were conducted in a range temperature varying between 160 and 200 °C, with a 20 °C step, using different peroxides, changing their concentration and considering also a mixture of three of them. A huge amount of rheometric cure curves were obtained (one for each temperature, peroxide used and concentration) and quantitatively compared one each other, to have an insight into the most effective temperature and peroxide to use during such kind of vulcanization, {{in terms of both}} vulcanization velocity and maximum torque reached. In order to interpret theoretically experimental results obtained, a peroxide decomposition kinetic model is presented, considering the complex set of reactions that characterize peroxide crosslinking, namely homolytic cleavage of peroxide, hydrogen abstraction, polymer radicals formation, polymer radicals coupling, cross-link formation and polymer scission. Starting from the above -most probable- kinetic scheme, a system of non-linear differential equations with few variables is obtained and solved numerically, after suitable variable substitutions, by means of a Runge-Kutta algorithm. Crosslinking density is thus evaluated numerically and compared to rheometer experimental curve, which may provide a reliable indication of the average cured rubber crosslinking, once suitably scaled to unitary values. By means of the numerical approach proposed, an estimation of the kinetic constants per single reaction, once known kinetic decomposition laws, may be evaluated and hence the activity of each peroxide may be estimated using a few experimental data at only two different temperatures...|$|E
5000|$|An {{isolation}} transformer is a transformer used to transfer electrical power {{from a source}} of alternating current (AC) power to some equipment or device while isolating the powered device from the power source, usually for safety reasons.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a wide input range DC-DC converter is proposed along with a robust power control scheme. The proposed converter and its control {{is designed to be}} compatible to a fuel cell power source, which exhibits 2 : 1 voltage variation as well as a slow transient response. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a primary three-level boost converter stage cascaded with a high frequency, isolated boost converter topology, which provides a <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> gain and <b>isolation</b> from the input source. The function of the first boost converter stage is to maintain a constant voltage at the input of the cascaded DC-DC converter to ensure optimal performance characteristics with high efficiency.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we studied the {{possibility}} to use high voltage DC bus to facilitate the energy transport in the smart grids, especially oriented to renewable energies. Recent studies [1] show {{that it is necessary}} to increase the output voltage in order to minimize transport losses on high distances. That is possible if we use electronic systems able to convert with a high efficiency the low voltage delivered by the local generators constituted by the Pv panels, the wind generators and other ones systems in various power ranges, and providing a high output voltage. In our study we expect to reach a voltage up to 5 kV and more. The facilities offered by the DC bus are essentially in a very easy full synchronization and the possibility of communication supported by the power lines as in a PLC mode. So, as a consequence, it is important to improve the DC-DC converters to reach more than 5 kV DC at the output. The main difficulty encountered when the goal is to increase the voltage in a smart DC-DC converter, is the small volume usable of those converter, the low cost, and of course the higher efficiency as possible. High voltage elevation implies the use of specific transformers (THT transformers) with a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>isolation</b> performance, and a specific coils configuration to avoid spark discharges. The use of high voltage transformers ineluctably implies lower coupling coefficient between the coils, and undesirable superposed oscillations in the primary and secondary currents and voltages. More over the low coupling factor implies an increasing of the internal energy stored in the leakage inductors, that must recycled in order to keep a good efficiency. Previous studies [2] show the interest of using light structure converters based on one driven switch as the basically step-up boost. Some improvements [3] allow an expanding range working, and more specifically in the high value Vout /Vin of the converter ratio. We demonstrate in this paper that it is possible to use low coupled coils transformers to insure a perfect control and management of the energy without worrying about the leakage non-transferable energies stored in the various distributed inductors...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a space-based LIDAR-system (Light Detection and Ranging), a global {{analysis}} of gases in the atmosphere such as water vapor, methane or CO 2 can be carried out. The understanding of the processes in the atmosphere can be improved by an extensive database. Thereby a revision and correction of the climate models and therefore a precise prediction would be enabled. Thermal and mechanical load requirements are particularly high during space operation. Thereby questions concerning reliability at operating times {{of at least three}} years without loss in pulse energy and beam quality are of special importance. Even though simple systems are already in orbit, an advancement of critical components in complex systems is required. The investigation of the mounting of optical components is carried out by {{means of a}} specially designed furnace. Thereby several strategies are considered. The offset strategy proves suitable for mounting tolerance-insensitive components. In combination with a local cooling the tolerances fall below the required 100 µrad. The joining of non-linear crystals using solder is hindered by different CTE’s along different crystal axes. The BBO-crystal is crack-sensitive due to its mechanical properties. For the joining, a suitable combination of material and structure can be found and the resulting combination can be demonstrated by an example of a functional Pockels cell. Thereby it is shown that the boundary conditions concerning electrical contacting and <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>isolation</b> are fulfilled simultaneously. Joining LBO-crystals is less critical than joining BBO-crystals due to the differences in mechanical properties. For an efficient frequency conversion, the temperature distribution within the LBO-crystal has to be homogeneous. For this reason the crystal is soldered planar. The conversion efficiency at 67 % is at the level of presently used clamped systems. For the investigation of the technical suitability of the soldering technology for assembling TGG-crystals, polarization measurements are used. Here it becomes evident that the path difference R is smaller for soldered crystals than for glued crystals. The distribution along the crystal facet is more homogeneous. Both are advantageous for the properties of optical isolators. The KTP-crystal is mounted between two heater bars, similar to the mounting of the LBO-crystal. Both the investigation of the mechanical stability of the KTP-crystal after the temperature cycling test and the analysis of the optical properties show the technical applicability of the soldering technology. During the optical tests a non-soldered and a soldered KTP-crystal are compared. The deviation of optical performance POpt of both analyzed KTP-crystals is within the tolerance accuracy. In the future, mounting of non-linear crystals by means of solder enables the realization of completely soldered laser systems. Thereby the vibration-sensitive clamping or outgassing gluing technique can be dispensed. In comparison to gluing, soldering additionally offers a substantial higher thermal and electrical conductivity. Both the performance and the rated service time of the instruments can be increased. Besides the higher mechanical stability, the solder technique offers the advantage of the re-melting of the join. The already soldered optical component can be readjusted. During the soldering process a combination of solders with different melting points can increase the mechanical stability of the assembly and simplify the mounting of the laser system...|$|E
