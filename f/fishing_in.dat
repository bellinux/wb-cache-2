40|$|Shoaling {{behaviour}} {{has been}} shown to provide many benefits to group members. In this study we examined the ability of fish shoals to escape from a novel trawl apparatus. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> shoals of 5 found, and escaped through, a hole in the oncoming trawl more quickly than <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> the larger shoals displayed a significant decrease in escape latencies over a series of five trawls, providing clear evidence of net avoidance learning, whereas <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs showed no evidence of learning over successive runs. Observations suggested that more information on the location of the escape route was available to <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> larger shoal sizes owing to social stimulation...|$|R

5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy. The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> 1935.|$|E

5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest fly <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through Glacier National Park. Though the park {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned {{to the other side of}} the border.|$|E

5|$|The Kettle Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via Kettle Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the area. An Indian village existed {{at the mouth of}} the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763. In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the Kettle Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting rights in the area until 1804.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} of the tel {{has revealed}} a small settlement, {{the only one}} of that period in eastern Arabia, on its northern side. It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis, planted palm trees, tended cattle, sheep and goats and also ventured into <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the Arabian Sea. The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as binding material. The plastered floors in the houses were said to have been spacious. Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes.|$|E

5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive <b>fishing.</b> <b>In</b> places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E

Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for fly <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E

Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
