The study includes {{an evaluation of}} previous work, an experimental investigation and a presentation of improved modelling techniques for determining pipeline design parameters. The experimental investigation was carried out to obtain an improved database for modelling the flow of coarse-particle slurries. Tests were conducted using sand slurries and coal slurries in pipes of industrial scale. Frictional <b>headlosses,</b> delivered solids concentrations, concentration distributions and velocity distributions were measured as functions of in situ solids concentration and mean velocity. Solids deposition velocities were determined visually using transparent pipe sections. The experimental results were used to develop an improved two layer model for estimating frictional <b>headlosses,</b> a force balance model for concentration distributions and a method for predicting deposition velocities.

5000|$|The MBBR {{system is}} {{considered}} a biofilm process. Other conventional biofilm processes for wastewater treatment are called trickling filter, rotating biological contactor (RBC) and biological aerated filter (BAF). Biofilm processes in general require less space than activated sludge systems because the biomass is more concentrated, and {{the efficiency of the}} system is less dependent on the final sludge separation. A disadvantage with other biofilm processes is that they experience bioclogging and build-up of <b>headloss.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} not to confuse conjugate depths (between which momentum is conserved) with alternate depths (between which energy is conserved). In the case of a hydraulic jump, the flow experiences a certain amount of energy <b>headloss</b> so that the subcritical flow downstream of the jump contains less energy than the supercritical flow upstream of the jump. Alternate depths are valid over energy conserving devices such as sluice gates and conjugate depths are valid over momentum conserving devices such as hydraulic jumps.|$|E
40|$|Depth {{filtration}} {{consists of}} four major phases: clean bed removal, filter ripening, steady state removal and breakthrough. Ripening {{is a consequence of}} previously captured particles serving as additional collectors, and is followed by a relatively steady state high quality water production. As particles deposit in a filter, pressure drop (<b>headloss)</b> across the filter increases. Particle removal and filter <b>headloss</b> characteristics vary with the size of particles in the filter influent. The transient behavior of a depth filter, as a function of particle size and system chemistry, was investigated by experimental and mathematical approaches in this work. ^ Laboratory scale filtration experiments were conducted with coagulated monodisperse suspensions of six different size particles under controlled conditions. Two coagulants, a cationic salt and a cationic polyelectrolyte, were used for particle destabilization. Particle concentration in the filtrate and <b>headloss</b> across the filter bed were recorded. Based on the O 2 ̆ 7 Melia and Ali model (1978) a semi-empirical mathematical model for particle removal was proposed. It was assumed that removal is proportional to the available deposition sites in the filter. Empirical models for <b>headloss</b> were presented. A hypothesis that the filter <b>headloss</b> is proportional to the volume of the deposit was also tested. ^ Experimental results indicated that the volume of the deposit is the key factor in depth filtration for describing <b>headloss</b> and steady state removal characteristics. Smaller particles form high volume deposits. Compared to cationic salt, cationic polymer creates deposits with higher volume. <b>Headloss</b> increases while the rate of particle removal decreases with increasing deposit volume. The mathematical model presented in this work described the observed filter behavior well. Calibrated models using experimental data successfully predicted previously reported filter data under similar conditions. The effects of the size of particles on filter performance could be conceptualized well by the fractal dimension of the deposit aggregates. The effect of particle - particle interaction on the fractal dimension, which is a function of particle size and system chemistry, merits further research. ...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{observation}} of filter beds at South African water treatment plants {{showed that the}} filters were insufficiently cleaned by the backwash system and that media losses were unexpectedly high. Specific deposit tests developed by the RAU Water Research Group indicated that the dirtiness correlated with the organic content of the water being treated. This led to the hypothesis that biofilm is present on the media, somehow causing both the media loss and the difficulty to attain efficient backwashing. Biofilm consists of organisms surrounded by a sticky, gelatinous polysaccharide matrix. This matrix, also known as extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS), is the bulk (50 - 90 %) of the biofilm. Biofilm {{plays an important role}} in the establishment and maintenance of organisms in a hostile environment. From the above it doesn¡¦t make sense trying to measure biofilm from the numeration of the organisms. A more reliable direct but tedious measure is quantifying the EPS. A new alternative method developed by the RAU Water Research Group is to mechanically strip the specific deposit off the filter media and then determine the organic fraction by combusting the sample at 500 ¢XC. Two aspects of mechanical behaviour are deemed important in this study. First, <b>headloss,</b> because an under prediction in <b>headloss</b> will result in a higher than expected backwash frequency. Second, bed expansion, because an under prediction in bed expansion will lead to media washout. Literature indicates that both <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion increase with increasing biofilm growth. However, all those studies were conducted at waste water treatment plants with high organic and solids loading. With the exception of one reference which only discusses <b>headloss,</b> nothing on this topic is available in the literature for potable water treatment. Mathematical models were used to reduce the data from multiple <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion experiments. For the <b>headloss</b> data the Ergun equation was used and the sphericity (ƒÚ) was retained as the only unmeasured calibration constant. For the bed expansion data the Dharmarajah equation was used and the sphericity was retained as the only unmeasured calibration constant. Calibration of the mathematical models was done with least square fitting. The two values of sphericity as determined by Ergun and Dharmarajah are not necessarily the same for the same media sample. The sphericity was used as a calibration constant without any physical meaning, which accounts for different sets of complex unknowns. Samples for experimental work were drawn from full scale operating water treatment plants. The treatment plants were spread over four provincesof South Africa with different raw water sources, but using approximately the same media. The sampling was done on three occasions, Winter 2003, Summer 2003 and Winter 2004, to cover the extreme temperatures experienced in South Africa. Samples collected at the plants were tested for <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion, then transported back to the laboratory and placed in the oven for 24 hours at 110 ¢XC. The sample was then sieved and the density determined. The <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion tests were then repeated in the laboratory. Parallel to these tests, EPS and volatile fraction quantification tests were done. Direct methods of measuring biofilm, namely EPS and volatile fraction, yielded measurable results, thereby confirming the presence of biofilm. Plants that had large quantities of EPS also had a high volatile fraction, thereby confirming the expectation that the volatile fraction is an excellent method to rapidly quantify biofilm presence. EPS made up 41 % of the volatile fraction, which is roughly comparable with the 50 - 90 % quoted in literature. Where large quantities of EPS were found at a plant, a high TOC reduction also occurred through the filters. The indirect methods of measuring biofilm, namely <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion, also yielded measurable results. The filter media with biofilm as sampled from the treatment plants had a higher <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion than the same sample after drying and sieving, which resembles virgin filter media. The sphericity values for <b>headloss</b> decrease by as much as 26 % which translates to a <b>headloss</b> gradient increase of 150 mm/m at typical filtration rates. The sphericity values for bed expansion decrease by as much as 18 % which translates to a bed expansion increase of 17 % at normal backwash rates. The conditions at the treatment plants sampled suggest that biofilm growth is stimulated by eutrophic raw water and the presence of pre-ozonation and inhibited when the high pH lime process is used. The mechanism which causes the increased <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion with increased biofilm is hypothesised to be media grains sticking together causing clumping, and not grains which are individually and uniformly covered with a smooth, uniform layer of biofilm. Designers can compensate for this increase in <b>headloss</b> and bed expansion in two ways. They could either apply a correction factor after application of the models to allow for more <b>headloss</b> or bed expansion during eventual plant operation, or they could adjust parameters within the models to account for the larger <b>headloss</b> or bed expansion. As the surface area sphericity was used as a calibration factor in this study and could account for different sets of complex unknowns, it is suggested that this factor is used for adjustment of the model. Operational practice in South Africa often includes in-situ chlorine or acid treatment to alleviate the problem of dirty filter beds. In this study, however, where high and efficient backwash rates were used during tests, no significant improvements in media cleanliness could be attributed to the use of either chlorine or acid. It seems that a good backwash system doesn¡¦t need such remediation, but plants with a backwash system which underperforms might find such remediation useful. Prof. J. Haarhof...|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} granular media filters used {{in drinking water}} treatment is ultimately limited by {{the efficiency of the}} backwash process. While a number of backwash studies have yielded important insights into the mechanisms involved in filter cleaning, none have {{led to the development of}} models which can predict what the actual backwash efficiency will be under a given set of conditions and how this will affect the filter in the long term. This paper describes an experimental investigation into the effect of backwash rate, type of coagulant, degree of clogging and accumulation of residual deposits (not removed by backwash) on the efficiency of fluidised bed filter backwash in laboratory scale filters treating a natural raw water coagulated with either alum or a cationic polymer blend.

Basic studies on the removal of coagulated clay suspensions indicated that the clay was removed throughout the depth (D. 3 m) of the filter for media sizes between 0. 6 and 1. 0 mm.

This work extends and complements previously successful studies on the treatment of medium to high turbidity raw waters using M. oleifera seed.;Laboratory studies using twin 100 mm diameter filter columns, were undertaken with the following variables: turbidities of 5 - 75 NTU; filtration rates of 5 - 20 m/h; filter depths of 70 and 120 cm; dual and single media beds, and media sizes of 0. 50 - 1. 00 mm and 0. 85 - 1. 70 mm. Deeper beds and smaller media were found to considerably reduce filtrate turbidity when using M. oleifera seed. The consequent <b>headloss</b> increase was only significant with the higher turbidity waters; dual media beds were most effective on such waters. Turbidity removal was reduced at higher filtration rates (10 m/h), due to lower retention times in the bed, and increased detachment of retained particles causing early turbidity breakthrough. Higher filtration rates with another natural coagulant, chitosan, increased turbidity removal and prolonged the time to breakthrough, due to the reduction in surface removal in the filter. At lower loading rates (5 NTU at 5 m/h), removal with M. oleifera seed was comparable with chitosan and aluminium sulphate, with the additional advantage of a lower <b>headloss.</b> Optimisation of the hydraulic variables for a specific coagulant was considered necessary to ensure maximum output and filtrate quality.;Field trials on a low turbidity natural raw water indicated that M. oleifera reduced the turbidity by > 95 % and bacterial numbers by 100 % at the optimum dose.

Recent developments in stormwater pollutant trap (SPTs), which are generally end-of-the-line devices designed to capture and store gross pollutants, for subsequent removal and disposal. During the last few decades, use of SPTs as a source of collecting and removing pollutants from stormwater (which carries many different types of chemicals and nonchemical pollutants that contaminates our rivers, lakes and other receiving bodies) has increased considerably. Wide-ranging efforts and attempts have been made in both academic and industrial research {{to improve the quality of}} stormwater by improving the use of gross pollutant traps (GPTs – known as hydrodynamic separators) by utilising and improving available experimental and modelling techniques. The use of vortex phenomena has always been a challenging problem and available data is rare and complicated in the literature. This research focuses on detailed investigation by experimental means. The generated vortex in this experiment is created in a cylindrical chamber above the level of a cylindrical screening basket. In addition, the research analyses the processes involved in this separation technique. One scale model of a Versa Trap (Type A) was experimentally analysed to investigate and establish the relationship between <b>headloss</b> and flow rate and hydraulic characteristics of a weir in a diversion weir pit. The Versa trap Type A storm pollutant traps are usually used as off-line traps in city and urban areas to capture and store debris – especially those which are captured from surfaces such as rooftops, paved streets, highways, parking lots, lawns, and paved and gravelled roads (Allison et al., 1998). The Versa Trap Type A utilises an upstream diversion weir pit to divert the design treatment flow (DTF) into the treatment chamber. Treated flow returns to the diversion pit downstream of the weir, where it re-enters the drainage system. Peak flow in excess of the DTF bypasses the SPT over the weir into the pipeline downstream. It has been demonstrated that the aggregate of all flows of three months average recurrence interval (ARI) and less represented the majority (up to 97. 5 %) of the total flow generated by a stormwater drainage catchment (Works, 2006). There is some conjecture as to the veracity of the ‘first flush’ theory, which holds that most of the pollutants in the catchments are transported during the first flush of the storm event (Lee et al., 2007). However, it is generally accepted that SPTs should be sized so as to treat only a portion of the peak flow, with excess flows bypassing the trap. The three month ARI peak flow is commonly taken as appropriate for establishing the minimum DTF required of the SPT. The measurement of <b>headloss</b> across a scale model of a VT Type A storm pollutant trap at a range of flow rates through the SPT, provide data from which a mathematical relationship between flow rate and the <b>headloss</b> cab be established for the device. The resultant relationship then can be used in another part of the experiment to establish the hydraulic characteristics of a weir across a cylindrical chamber, as used for the upstream diversion weir pit in conjunction with the Type A VT range of SPTs. By varying the weir height in a scale model of a diversion weir pit and measuring the flow rates associated with headlosses determined from the previously established relationship, the relationship between weir height and diverted flow can be established. This allows the designer to specify the weir height required to divert the flow rate associated with a specific peak flow or treatment flow of SPT design. Two main characteristics which determine the performance of a gross pollutant trap are trapping efficiency and required maintenance. The trapping efficiency is defined as the portion of the total mass of gross pollutant transported by stormwater that is retained by the trap. A low trapping efficiency means that gross pollutants pass through the trap and reach downstream waters. A poorly-maintained trap will be inefficient at trapping pollutants and is also a potential source of pollutants as trapped materials break down. The experiment parts of this project were tested at Curtin University of Technology’s Hydraulic Laboratory. To replicate typical in-situ conditions, the VT Type A was tested for 0, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 and 77 % simulated blocked screen conditions for trapping efficiency. Data analysis has demonstrated that the <b>headloss</b> increases in proportion to flow rates and screen blockage condition. The results were scaled up to provide data on the full range of unit sizes. This research describes the testing and scaling methodologies in detail, with graphical representation of <b>headloss</b> and other hydraulic parameters at various conditions. The study’s findings have capabilities to optimise any other types of stormwater treatment systems. These types of traps’ are used in commercial and residential environment. This experiment is in continuation of the experiment which was conducted by Muhammad Ismail on industrial gross pollutant traps using double basket to trap the debris for industrial application. Also another good reference for pollutant build up and wash off modelling of impervious surfaces in Perth area, is done by Saadat Ashraf in his PhD thesis.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Sand has been the main filter media used in rapid gravity filtration since their emergence in the 19 th century. This dominance is due to its low cost, availability and extensive experience {{which has led to}} dependable and predictable performance. Over recent years multi-media filters have become the typical filter arrangement. Sand still remains the preferred filter medium in the lower layer with typically anthracite used in the upper layer. A limitation to match previous work has been the emphasis on overall performance but mechanistic analysis as to the reasons for the variations compared to sand has been rare. The fundamental effects of particle size and consolidation on filtration performance and <b>headloss</b> are known but were not often accounted for in the reported research. This has limited the academic contribution of previous work and made it more difficult to compare with the data for this thesis. At an average treatment works the highest costs are {{associated with the use of}} chemicals (30...|$|E
40|$|A {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory to perform a hydraulic model study of energy losses in a combined sewer for the Minnesota Highway Department. The sewer {{is located in the}} vicinity of 38 th street South and Hiawatha Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The sewer passes under redesigned State Highway 55. The new highway design requires a modification of the existing sewer. The proposed new sewer design includes a change in geometry from the original circular 9. 25 ft pipe section to a 4. 25 ft high by 16 ft wide box, a length of box section, and then a transition back to the original 9. 25 ft pipe section. The crown of the pipe is depressed 5 ft {{to the top of the}} box section with the invert remaining at the present grade. The depression of the sewer crown allows the highway gradeline to be lower than it was for the old Highway 55. The transition had to be designed so that a minimum of <b>headloss</b> would result from the change in geometry. Minnesota Highway Departmen...|$|E
40|$|A 1 : 24 {{scale model}} of the {{collector}} well, the central structure of the projected cooling water intake for the James H. Campbell Power Generating Plant, Unit No. 3, on the eastshore of Lake Michigan was built and operated to determine the hydraulic characteristics of the structure. Piezometric pressure distributions and total energy headlosses were measured. Flow patterns and air evacuation characteristics were observed. The total <b>headloss</b> in the 22 ft diameter collector well {{was determined to be}} on the order of 4. 5 in. for the design flow of 824 cfs. The height of the collector well cover above tbe header axis had to exceed 6 ft in order to avoid formation of a strong vortex in the well. At a height of 11 ft the well performed satisfactorily. Flow rates in the four headers feeding into the collector well deviated by less than 2 per cent from the average. Air entrapped in the dome was evacuated by the £low. Flow from only two headers through the collector was also investigated. Johnson Division UOP, Inc., Consumer Power Company, Commonwealth Associates Inc...|$|E
40|$|Null space Newton {{algorithms}} are {{efficient in}} solving the nonlinear equations arising in hydraulic analysis of water distribution networks. In this article, we propose and evaluate an inexact Newton method that relies on partial updates of the network pipes' frictional <b>headloss</b> computations to solve the linear systems more efficiently and with numerical reliability. The update set parameters are studied to propose appropriate values. Different null space basis generation schemes are analysed to choose methods for sparse and well-conditioned null space bases resulting in a smaller update set. The Newton steps are computed in the null space by solving sparse, symmetric positive definite systems with sparse Cholesky factorizations. By using the constant structure of the null space system matrices, a single symbolic factorization in the Cholesky decomposition is used multiple times, reducing the computational cost of linear solves. The algorithms and analyses are validated using medium to large-scale water network models. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, Preprint extension of Abraham and Stoianov, 2015 ([URL] September 2015.
