40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} {{on the environmental}} acceptability of internal combustion engines led to strong efforts to meet the continuously getting stricter emission regulations. New concepts of combustion and injection have been developed together with appropriate techniques of exhaust gas aftertreatment. For diesel engines especially modern high pressure injection systems, such as the application of <b>distributor</b> <b>pump</b> and common rail have been applied successfully. However, internal mixture formation, ignition and combustion for this new systems are not completely understood so far. Optical measurement techniques offer {{the possibility of the}} in-situ investigation of the combustion process. An appropriate method for soot measurements, which is without source of interference also applicable to technical systems, is given by laser-induced incandescence (LII). The principle of this technique is to heat up the soot particles by a highly energetic laser pulse to temperatures well above ambient temperature and to detect the resulting thermal radiation. For appropriate experimental conditions, the signal can be shown to be proportional to the soot mass concentration within the detection volume. In this work, basic features of the technique are discussed in detail, especially with respect to the application within diesel engines.

40|$|A {{production}} distributor-type fuel-injection {{system for}} diesel engines has been extensively investigated via computer-assisted simulation and experimentation. The investigation was mainly aimed at assessing and validating a sophisticated computational model of the system, developed with specific attention given to the pump and to some important aspects concerning the injection pressure simulation, such as the dynamic effects of the injector needle lift, the flow unsteadiness, and compressibility effects on the nozzle-hole discharge coefficient. The pump delivery assembly was provided with a valve of the reflux type. This presented a flat in the collar, forming a return-flow restriction with the seat, and had no retraction piston. A single-spring injector, with a reduced sac volume, was fitted to the system. The numerical analysis of transient flow phenomena linked to the mechanical unit dynamics, including possible cavitation occurrence in the system, was performed using an implicit finite-difference algorithm, previously set up for in-line injection equipment. Particular care was exercised in modeling the <b>distributor</b> <b>pump</b> so as to match {{the dynamics of the}} delivery-valve assembly to the pressure wave propagation in the distributor and its outlets. The so-called minor losses were also taken into account and it was ascertained that sudden expansion and contraction losses were significant for the type of pump examined.
