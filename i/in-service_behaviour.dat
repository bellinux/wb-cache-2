The main aim of this manuscript is to analyze the <b>in-service</b> dynamic <b>behaviour</b> of a semi-rigid moment-resisting dowel-type connection between timber beam and column. For this purpose, two laboratory tests have been performed, the first on a connection and another one on a portal frame. The results are used to validate a numerical model of the simple portal frame, analyzed in OpenSees. The obtained relationships are also discussed and compared with Eurocode rules.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an action {{research}} study conducted {{with teachers and}} pupils in one Irish primary school. It focuses on human rights education {{as a framework for}} a whole-school approach to participative learning that promotes citizenship, justice, and equality, in the classroom. As the principal teacher in the school, the author sought to develop a more effective, inclusive and democratic learning environment for children. The study was a response to opportunities presented for human rights education both in international human rights law, and in the Irish primary school curriculum. The needs analysis generated research aims that focused on developing a human rights school, monitoring its impact, and evaluating the outcomes. The process included the development of policies, programmes, and methodologies to achieve the identified aims. The change process ran over the course of one year, during which the children were engaged in participative learning about, in and for human rights. The praxis based implementation model involved a series of cumulative stages of action and reflection. Monitoring and evaluation methodologies included questionnaire based longitudinal cohort studies, formal and semi-formal meetings, and the use of teachers' diaries. The resultant data was analysed and interpreted with the participants, and resulted in findings across four areas: • The role and function of the school leadership in facilitating, and implementing a whole-school approach to human rights education. • Aspects of the curriculum, and the hidden curriculum, including participation, time, and evaluation. • Professional development, including pre-service, and <b>in-service</b> training. • <b>Behaviour,</b> and the framework for accountability, decision-making, transparency, and responsibility in the school. The resultant recommendations point to the need for the school partners to consolidate the human rights approach through the ongoing provision of resources and time to participative methodologies, and the responsibility on the Department of Education and Science to facilitate and support schools seeking to encourage democratic education.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years there has been an {{increasing}} interest in the study and development of processes that make it possible to obtain ultra-fine grained materials. Although there exists a large number of published works related to the improvement of the mechanical properties in these materials, {{there are only a few}} studies that analyse their <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> (fatigue and wear). In order to bridge the gap, in this present work, the fatigue and wear results obtained for connecting rods manufactured by using two different aluminium alloys (AA 5754 and AA 5083) previously deformed by severe plastic deformation (SPD), using Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP), in order to obtain the ultrafine grain size in the processed materials are shown. For both aluminium alloys, two initial states were studied: annealed and ECAPed. The connecting rods were manufactured from the previously processed materials by using isothermal forging. Fatigue and wear experiments were carried out in order to characterize the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the components. A comparative study of the results was made for both initial states of the materials. Furthermore, Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations were used in order to compare experimental results with those obtained from simulations.

40|$|Learner {{discipline}} {{has become}} a major concern in South African schools. A society of entitlement has been bred over the past 20 years. The school is an open system that influences its environment and is being influenced by it too. The most challenging concern, at least for teachers, is to create and to maintain a form of order and structure at schools. The troublesome situation has an impact on teachers as they have to spend more time addressing challenging behaviour instead of spending that time on teaching a set curriculum and syllabus. Unfortunately, teachers report feelings of being ill-prepared to deal effectively with the challenging behaviour of learners in schools. Hence it is imperative to consider strategies to foster school discipline to manage and modify challenging behaviour in schools. To date, most researches have shown a major paradigm shift from the punitive disciplinary measures of the past towards a rather preventive and more positive approach. It became inevitable that learner discipline should be correctional and educational – especially after the abolishment of corporal punishment in South African schools. An increase attention has started to concentrate on early identification and prevention of challenging behaviour and on strategies to resolve such behaviour at its earliest appearance. Some of the guiding determinants for this positive approach are vested in maintaining a safe, harmonious and orderly environment that is conducive to teaching and learning. The outcry is to promote and encourage discipline amongst learners. An approach that has been termed school-wide positive behaviour intervention and support seems to address most of the challenging behaviours. Through the use of document analysis, observation and group interviews school-wide positive behaviour intervention and support was embraced. The findings further revealed that through proper planning, implementation strategies, and <b>in-service</b> training positive <b>behaviour</b> approach can be implemented in schools as framework for school discipline in primary schools. School-wide positive behaviour intervention and support will contribute successfully in managing and modifying challenging behaviour, fostering discipline in schools, and to educate learners in the habit of accountability and responsibility for their actions without using punishment following specified rules. Doing so some of the critical and developmental outcomes of education in South Africa will be realized. Although research in this area is limited, there are encouraging signs that a coordinated adoption of validated practice could substantially reduce challenging behaviours and thereby enhance the social and emotional well-being of learners in today’s society...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this {{research}} suggests the importance of manufacturing variables and their influence {{on the behavior of}} super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) alloy when exposed to corrosive aqueous environments. Studies show that SDSS alloys have many applications due to their good physical, mechanical and corrosion resistance properties. However, {{there are a number of}} cases of in-service failures of SDSS alloys, such as pitting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and environmentally assisted cracking failures. The root cause of these failures was due to the impact of one or more manufacturing variables such as surface finish, microstructure defects or deficiencies after deformation. From this concept, a detailed study into the effect of manufacturing variables on the corrosion resistance of a UNS S 39274 super duplex stainless steel has been carried out. The manufacturing variables studied are as follows: Effect of surface condition; The corrosion resistance of stainless steel components is very sensitive to the final surface condition. The effect of surface condition on the corrosion resistance was investigated by measuring the critical pitting temperature (CPT) and the pitting potential (Epit) of in-service UNS S 39274 super duplex stainless steel tubular sections with three different surface roughness values of Ra = 2. 8, 3. 2 and 3. 5 m. Experimental results confirmed that the surface roughness parameter Ra is a useful parameter as a general and basic guideline of surface texture but it’s not sufficient on its own to predict the likely effect of surface roughness on the <b>in-service</b> corrosion <b>behaviour</b> of SDSS materials. The manufacturer of super duplex stainless steel products should include the electrochemical corrosion evaluation such as the CPT or Epit values beside the surface roughness average value Ra and PRENs in SDSS alloy assessment. Effect of microstructure; The thermo-mechanical handling of super duplex stainless steels is an important factor in their performance. This is due to the complex nature of the material which is highly alloyed with Cr, Ni, Mo, and N. Exposure to certain temperature ranges leads to undesired secondary phases formation. The presence of intermetallic phases has been found to be harmful to super duplex stainless steel properties. A study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of thermal exposure of a solution annealed UNS S 39274 super duplex stainless steel to temperatures of 850 C, 1000 ºC and 1300 ºC on its microstructure and its localised corrosion resistance. Heat treatment at 850 ºC and 1000 C caused formation of intermetallics such as sigma () and chi () while at 1300 C caused precipitation of secondary austenite and enlarged grains and percentage of ferrite was observed. The formation of intermetallics of sigma () and chi () had a drastic effect on the corrosion resistance of the super duplex stainless steel. Electrochemical measurements confirmed that the intermetallics affected the corrosion resistance by reducing the pitting potential by around 80 % in the active direction. Evaluation of the corrosion morphology using SEM revealed depletion at the ferrite/austenite interfaces created intergranular corrosion path with preferential attack of the ferrite phase. The present results confirmed that PRENs is not suitable for corrosion assessment of SDSS after exposure to intermetallic temperature ranges. Effect of cold work; Cold work introduces metallurgical changes like dislocations and deformation bands which affect the corrosion resistance of stainless steel components. Cold work is still a complicated phenomenon for ferritic/austenitic alloys such SDSS. The effect of cold work (0 %, 4 %, 8 %, 12 % and 16 % plastic strain) on the pitting corrosion behaviour of UNS S 39274 SDSS was evaluated. The Ferrite phase of the material exhibits greater degrees of plastic deformation under straining providing a greater number of initiation sites than the austenite phase. The hydrogen embrittelement of the cold worked specimens was investigated after 48 hours cathodic charging in 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4. Experimental results indicated that the increase in cold work caused reduction in mechanical properties such as elongation and strain to failure. The depth of embrittlement increased as the degree of cold work increased and revealed brittle surfaces of cleavage fracture mode. Manufacturer and users should consider the degree of plastic strain when cold worked SDSS components going to work in corrosive environments or hydrogen containing environments. The main conclusion of the work is that the interactions between corrosive environments and SDSS components containing one or more of the manufacturing variables evaluated must be considered if reductions in in-service life are to be avoided.

40|$|Composite one-way {{concrete}} floor slabs with profiled steel decking as permanent formwork {{are commonly used}} in the construction industry. Despite their common usage, relatively {{little research has been}} undertaken on the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of such slabs and little guidance is available to practising engineers. Most previous experimental studies of composite slabs incorporating steel decking have involved short-term load tests that have concentrated on the strength, ductility and failure mode of the slabs. Long-term testing to study the time-dependent service load behaviour and in particular, the effects of creep and shrinkage of the concrete in this increasingly popular form of construction have been largely neglected. There exists an urgent need for research on the serviceability of composite slabs, as excessive deflection is often the critical design consideration, especially in long-span slabs. The situation has been exacerbated in recent years with the advent of high strength materials (both concrete and steel) without significantly higher stiffness, {{and the development of a}} wide range of new and innovative decking profiles. Serviceability rather than strength is often the governing limit state in the design of concrete elements, particularly in shallow deflection-sensitive elements such as floor slabs. The research in this thesis is the first detailed study of the effects of creep and shrinkage on the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of composite slabs. Laboratory experiments have been conducted on composite slabs to measure: the distribution of shrinkage strain through the thickness of the slabs; shrinkage-induced deflections in the slabs and time-dependent deflections and cracking under sustained loads. Analytical models have been developed and calibrated to predict these effects and reliable design guidance has been presented for the construction industry and practising design engineers. The change in the bond-slip relationship between profiled steel decking and concrete slab with time due to creep and shrinkage was not identified previously. The time-dependent effects of creep and shrinkage on the bond-slip characteristics for slabs with profiled decking during extended periods under sustained service loads have also been investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of chert or flint in aggregates used for concrete manufacture {{has long been}} a source of concern in the context of alkali-silica reactivity. The global in-service performance of chert and flint-bearing aggregates, however, varies from innocuous to deleterious. This could be due to variations in the degree of crystallinity of the silica, which influences potential reactivity. Chert occurs in significant Irish sources of aggregate used for concrete, yet no cases of deleterious expansion {{have been reported in the}} Republic of Ireland to date. Many of these sources fail to conclusively demonstrate innocuous behaviour in the laboratory expansion tests despite satisfactory <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A previous X-ray diffraction study, employing quartz crystallinity index, had indicated a significant difference between Irish Carboniferous cherts and English Cretaceous flints. This paper reports a further study of crystallinity, correlated with mortar bar expansion tests, but employing both quartz crystallinity index and domain size in the characterisation of crystallinity. The influence of chert content was also studied. Twenty-three Irish aggregate sources were sampled, and petrographic analysis revealed that 17 of these contained chert. Three flint-bearing aggregates, from sources in England that had demonstrated alkali-silica reactivity, were also sampled. Chert and flint were extracted from the aggregate samples by a petrographer experienced in the field of concrete technology. Twenty-six distinct samples were successfully extracted from 13 of the Irish and the three English sources. X-ray diffraction testing confirmed the previous findings (using the quartz crystallinity indices) that the Irish cherts are,more crystalline than the English flints. Domain size determination, however, showed that the difference in crystallinity of the national sets was less than that anticipated. The influence of chert content is advanced as a hypothesis to explain the apparent reactivity of Irish cherts in screening tests. The potential value of combining domain size and chert content determination in helping to classify aggregate reactivity is advanced for cases where <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> is in significant conflict with findings from standard laboratory tests...|$|E

40|$|Welding, surface treatment, {{plastic forming}} and other {{manufacturing}} processes generate residual stresses and introduce distortion in engineering components and assemblies.

Inertia friction welding between Ni-base superalloy components was considered in the present study.

Inverse eigenstrain framework was used for the interpretation of neutron diffraction measurements in order to find the underlying eigenstrain distributions.

Moreover, the way the deformable material behaves may lead to malfunctions and damages of the overall structure. To this end we have used a tool, named SoftWorld that permits to model and simulate the behaviour of non-rigid materials, in our case the sunroof fabric, taking into account material properties. SoftWorld adopts a particle-based model by which an object can be represented by a set of particles connected by forces describing the objects mechanical behaviour.

Their strong heterogeneity and multiscale microstructure make {{the study of the}} mechanical properties and the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> very challenging: new techniques are required by industrial research to better investigate these aspects. In this work a novel technique based on statistical nanoindentation is exploited to obtain results about the microstructure build-up and the mechanical properties. An innovative high-speed nanoindentation method is here combined and compared with a standard nanoindentation procedure in order to get highly consistent statistical results. Combining the high-speed nanoindentation, the statistical deconvolution and SEM/EDS investigations, the main phases present in the tested hydrated cement paste have been characterized. High-resolution maps of the mechanical properties are in good agreement with SEM-EDS results. The evolution of the mechanical properties has been tested over the time and in particular after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days of hydration. It was found that the nano-mechanical properties were almost constant during the hydration time and the evolution of the bulk mechanical resistance properties of the cement paste is found to be due to a variation of the volume proportions between the three principal phases (low-density, high-density and ultra-high-density C-S-H) ...|$|E

The present Chapter is concerned with one significant load-bearing component, namely the suspension push-rod. These push-rods exist at the four corners of a car and link the monocoque, engine and gearbox casing to a racing track and, as such, they are subject to severe inertial forces and dynamic compressive and flexure forces. The design, manufacture and <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of carbon/epoxy push-rods are discussed in the present Chapter. Both uniform and tapered layups of unidirectional and woven cross-ply prepreg have been used to manufacture pushrods of aerofoil cross-sections. These structural components have been loaded to catastrophic failure and the identified damage mechanisms were seen to includefibre micro buckling, fibre kinking and fibre fracture. A comparison has been made between the actual and theoretically predicted failure strains and it is seen that buckling was the ultimate cause of failure in all cases. The ultimate strength of the carbon/epoxy composite material was greater than the compressive strength of the push-rods and consequently, scope exists for improving the performance of the present design of composite push-rods...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, dynamic {{effects on}} bridge decks {{brought about by}} moving vehicle loads, {{are taken into account}} by {{increasing}} the static loads by an impact factor. Recent researchers have found that actual impact factors can be much higher than the recommendations given in various bridge design codes of practice and hence the subject needs investigation. This paper describes the formulation of a computer based bridge-vehicle system to study the dynamic behaviour of bridge-vehicle interaction. The modelling of the bridge itself is using finite element formulation of quadrilateral flat shell elements with eccentric beam stiffeners. The vehicle is modelled as a rigid body with two-axle and four-wheel sprung load units. Because of the effect of interleaf friction in the suspension system of the vehicle, the load-deformation relationship for the spring is represented by a hysteretic bi-linear diagram. In addition, the surface roughness of the bridge pavement is considered as a stationary random process characterized by a power spectral density function. The results of the model are compared with other similar works. The verification processes for the theoretical bridge-vehicle interaction system has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} model <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> and to achieve results which are quantitatively as well as qualitatively descriptive of actual performance. The developed computer based model can further be used for parametric studies to investigate the cause of high impact factors...|$|E
40|$|Blanking of {{sheet metal}} is an {{important}} forming process in the automotive industry for the manufacture of mechanical components. The final component shape, obtained {{at the end of}} bending or deep-drawing processes, often has sharp edges due to the blanking operation. Concerning passenger safety components, like seat belt anchors, rounding of the edges by punching is necessary to avoid cutting the belt material. In addition to removing the sharp edges, the punching results in work hardening of the material in the rounded zones which results in an increase in the local resistance of the material. In this study, a high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA S 500 MC) has been tested with the aim of quantifying the blanking and edge rounding operations. The mechanical behaviour of test specimens is investigated by means of tensile tests and the material is characterised in terms of Vickers micro-hardness. Numerical simulations of the edge rounding process are developed using previously identified material behaviour laws. The residual stress fields are characterised and compared to experimental results. This is done so that numerical simulation can be done in the future to prediction the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the component. Specimens with rounded edges are compared to specimens that were not submitted to the rounding operation. It is shown that Edge Rounding by Punching improves the component resistance, therefore justifying the use of this process in the manufacture of automotive safety components...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calculation methodology for failure analyses of jointing {{systems such as}} weldlines submitted to dynamic crash loading. The numerical analysis of automotive welded component integrity requires {{to take account of}} the complex multi-physical phenomena involved during the manufacturing process in order to provide a better understanding of its <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Indeed, weldlines are one of the main jointing element within aluminium structures due to the robust process technology and to good durability and crashworthiness results. The assessment of weldline properties is still a problem, especially in complex crash loading, where weldlines are one of the main items of full car crash behaviour prediction. This is the motivation for an investigation on a methodology combining both welding process and crash simulations. We first present the calculation methodology, based on local/global approach, taking account of the physical phenomena involved during welding, computed locally, to predict the global crack initiation of automotive components and the way it propagates. The theoretical models used for the simulation of the interactions between heat transfer, metallurgy and mechanics as well as the micro-mechanical damage model used for failure are then briefly recalled before describing the way {{to take into account the}} metallurgical transformations and the induced plasticity due to welding process during crash calculation. The second part of the paper deals with toughness assessment of aluminium T-joints made of extruded profiles submitted to a bending moment. Two joint configurations are calculated and results are then compared with experiments. This investigation was conducted in the framework of a European project called IMPACT for Improved Failure Prediction for Advanced Crashworthiness of Transportation Vehicles.

40|$|P 92 {{steel is}} a high alloy steel that has been {{specifically}} designed for operating at high temperatures (6000 C - 650 °C) and has found wide use in the power generation industry, particularly since 2005. For the successful installation and use of this advanced steel, all aspects of its behaviour, {{in terms of both}} metallurgy and <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour,</b> must be Investigated. Investigating all the relevant material aspects {{is beyond the scope of}} a single PhD, and so the Supergen consortium funds a number of projects working on different material aspects. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate, and seek a greater understanding of, the behaviour of welds in P 92 steel so that their <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> may be better understood particularly the response of the material to post-weld heat treatments (PWHT), the optimum weld consumable composition and the microstuctural development during creep-rupture. This understanding has been achieved through a combination of microstructural characterization, thermodynamic modelling and mechanical testing. Specifications for weld metals define a range of compositions; thermodynamic modelling has enabled a better understanding of how the composition affects the final microstructure of P 92 weld metal (given that this work is based upon thermodynamic predictions, the understanding developed here is applicable to both parent and weld metal). Precipitation strengthening is important to the creep resistance of P 92 and the modelling has revealed how precipitate levels vary based on composition. Using this knowledge, quality checks on P 92 used by industry can better ensure the fitness for service of a material if an accurate composition is known; furthermore, this understanding will enable manufacturers to further tailor compositions to produce the strongest possible material. Following welding with P 92 fillers, post-weld heat treatment is carried out, and there is a desire to perform this heat treatment close to the AII temperature of the materials involved. As such, it is important to accurately know the Al temperature of the materials being heat treat ed. A combination of thermodynamic modelling, experimental thermal analysis and microstructural characterization was used to investigate the key transformation of ferrite to austenite. This investigation focused on the effect of composition on the transformation temperature, AI, and the rate at which austenite could form during PWHT. An equation to predict the Ae 1 temperature of P 92 is produced and validated. The knowledge of how composition affects the Al temperature is useful for both welds and parent material, enabling the design and selection of P 92 material that will not undesirably transform during heat treatments. It is proposed that the equation for Ae 1 allows the determination of maximum safe heat treatment temperatures and will reduce the likelihood of poor quality material entering service. Experimental work has demonstrated that during PWHT (or parent material tempering), equilibrium conditions are approached, confirming that Ae 1 should be used to determine maximum heat treatment temperatures instead of the AC 1 temperatures which are currently employed. Creep testing of three different weld consumables was carried out to determine which had the best properties for use in service, and to understand the microstructural features which controlled creep behaviour of these weld metals. Creep testing of weld metal has identified that δ-ferrite causes early failure as the resulting precipitate-free zones (PFZs) are creep weak. The presence of localized S-ferrite is caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of ferrite stabilizers, particularly tungsten within the weld metal, resulting in greater stability of S-ferrite and its retention in the weld. Using this knowledge, alloy specifications of weld consumables and corresponding welding procedures can be improved to ensure a homogeneous distribution of elements so that localized weaknesses in a weld can be avoided. There is tentative evidence that tungsten plays an important role in the creep ductility of P 92 and that variations in tungsten and silicon could lead to an optimization of creep strength. The outcomes of this thesis facilitate a better understanding of P 92 parent metal and welds and provide results that are immediately applicable and useful to the power generation industry.

40|$|Defects and {{imperfections}} are intrinsically {{generated by}} casting processes, due to several reasons. The final properties and <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of castings are always related to microstructural features and to defects and imperfections: both microstructure and defects/imperfections {{are the results}} of process stages, alloys properties and dies & tools design. As an example, it should be considered that in HPDC filling stage extreme conditions are established: complexity of components leads to complex dies, and the high production rates required (up to 120 shots/h) lead to very high filling velocities for the molten alloy (up to 40 m/s) with strong generation of turbulence in the flow. Solidification takes place in few seconds, and the die is first in contact with a molten alloy at more than 700 °C and, after 30 - 40 seconds, with a sprayed lubricant at room temperature. For these reasons HPDC (as well as other Aluminium alloys casting processes, such as permanent mould casting process) {{can be considered a}} “defect generating process”. Not only an average 5 - 10 % scrap is typically produced, but the type, size and severity of defects and imperfections are varying. From these considerations, it seems that the potential of high-pressure die-casting and permanent mould casting processes will be completely exploited only when the quality level will be perfectly optimised. In this regard, the analysis of defects and imperfections allows the foundry to monitor the products quality respect to a quality standard. Further, the analysis of defects and imperfections provide to the foundry useful correlations between their type/distribution and their origin, so that it could be possible to define process modification for improving the quality. One of the current targets of the StaCast project is the compilation and dissemination of common tools to allow foundries to define a proper, comparable, quality standard. The first tool to be proposed is a common basis of language, i. e. a terminology and classification of defects and imperfections in order to help die-casting foundries to face with increased confidence and ability the defect-related issues, to assure quality and reliability of their products...|$|E
40|$|The {{significantly}} {{high energy}} consumption and greenhouse (GHG) emissions {{associated with the}} production of primary aluminium has become of paramount concern to the aluminium industry. The production of one tonne semi-fabricated aluminium, from bauxite mining to semi-fabrication, produces 9. 7 tonnes of CO 2 -equivalents (CO 2 e). As a primary CO 2 e contributor, and a component within {{the control of the}} anode producer/smelter, consumable carbon anodes have been spotlighted as the key to increasing energy efficiency and minimising GHG emissions. Presently there exist four major fields of research concerning anode improvement technologies: oxidation resistant treatments, pitch-free carbon composites, incorporation of alternative raw materials and inert anodes. The present study seeks to develop the foundations for the complete or partial replacement of either petroleum coke or coal tar pitch with waste polymeric material. Pilot scale laboratory anodes were produced according to a standard commercial recipe that was modified in order to assess the effect of polymer replacement on bulk anode properties and in-service performance. Five standard recipe anodes were produced in order to serve as the benchmark for property assessment. Polymer modified anodes were produced with 10, 20 and 30 % replacement of either carbon aggregate or coal tar pitch. Polymers investigated were Bakelite, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a standard polymeric waste blend. Anodes were assessed in three stages. The first stage comprised the assessment of basic microstructural, mineralogical and thermal degradation characteristics of anodes. The second evaluated bulk anode properties utilising the same methods that are used for commercial quality control. The final stage was an assessment of in-service anode behaviour. The study determined that the overall impact of polymer replacement on the properties and <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of anodes was negative. The replacement of carbon aggregate with Bakelite yielded anodes with low bulk density and high porosity. Bakelite anodes had poor bulk properties and experienced excessive carbon consumption during electrolysis. Replacement of coal tar pitch with HDPE, PET or the waste blend yielded similar outcomes. Thermoplastics were observed to increase the graphitisation of anodes; however at a bulk level porosity negated any positive effects that increased graphitisation would have on properties...|$|E
40|$|Fusion welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods for joining metals. This method has largely been {{developed}} by experiments, i. e. trial and error. The problem of distortion and residual stresses of a structure in and around a welded joint is important to control. This is especially important in the aerospace industry where the components are expensive and safety and quality are important issues. The safety requirements and the high costs of performing experiments to find different manufacturing routes is the motivation to increase the use of simulations in design of component as well as its manufacturing. Thus, in the case of welding, one can evaluate the effect of different fixtures, welding parameters etc on the deformation of the component. Then it is possible to optimise a chain of manufacturing processes as, for example, the welding residual stresses will affect the deformations during a subsequent heat treatment. The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to develop an efficient and reliable method and tool for simulation of the welding process using the Finite Element Method. The simulation tool will then be used when designing and planning the manufacturing of a component, so that introduction of new components can be made with as little disturbance as possible. In the same time the developed tool will be suitable for the task to perform an optimal design for manufacturing. Whilst this development will also be valuable in predicting the component's subsequent <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the key target is to ensure that designs are created which are readily manufactured. If this understanding is captured and made available to designers, true design for manufacture will result. This will lead to right first time product introduction and minimal ongoing manufacturing costs as process capability will be understood and designed into the component. When creating a numerical model, the aim is to implement the physical behaviour of the process into the computer model. However, it may be necessary to compromise between accuracy of the model and the required computational time. Different types of simplifications of the problem and more efficient computation methods are discussed. Methods for alleviating the modelling, and in particular the creation of the weld path, of complex geometries is presented. Simulations and experiments have been carried out on simple geometries in order to validate the models. Godkänd; 2003; 20070216 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Detonation gun coatings of tungsten carbide have been widely recognised {{as one of the}} most effective anti-wear coatings for oilfield applications. However, very little fundamental tribological information exists for the material, which hinders coating development and the evolution of correct specifications. This study redresses this problem by conducting adhesive, abrasive and erosive tests upon the coating and relating the findings to the coated microstructure. The intention has been to simulate the <b>in-service</b> <b>behaviour</b> of parallel gate valves, which are used primarily to control flow in remote locations where reliability and freedom from maintenance are essential. Although problems with such valves are rare, costs associated with replacement are exceptionally high and therefore a high research priority has been placed on valves of this type. Currently, new designs of valve are tested using a pipe loop rig at BP Research Centre. However, such tests are both expensive and time consuming and with the increasing desire to bring products to market more quickly an alternative is sought. Probably, the area offering most scope for improvement is in material specification of the sealing surfaces and this work sets out to produce a first stage selection procedure for candidate materials. Uniquely, the study has taken one component, systematically categorised its failure mechanisms using non-destructive replication techniques and then reproduced them in the laboratory. The failure analysis has pointed to three-body abrasion, erosion and adhesion being the dominant failure modes and therefore, a suite of tribo-test methods have been developed to replicate them These are namely reciprocating diamond-on-flat, slurry erosion and reciprocating pin-on-plate tests. The material studied was a proprietary detonation gun coating of tungsten carbide, LW 45, which is currently the most popular seal facing material specified for gate valves. A conformal contact geometry was chosen for the reciprocating pin-on-plate tests and problems with alignment were overcome by using a pre-test running-in procedure with 1 μm metallographic paste. Wear of LW 45 occurring during the pin-on-plate test was not affected by test speed over the range selected, but was highly dependent upon load. Four different categories ranging from minimal wear to catastrophic wear have been identified. Extensive post test analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy has further classified the failure that occurs into two groups, termed mild and severe. In the mild regime wear occurs by preferential removal of the binder phase, which is minimised on further sliding by protruding carbide particles. Eventually sufficient binder is removed for carbide fall-out to occur, upon which the cycle is repeated. A greater wear volume is produced by the severe wear mechanism which is caused by the interlinking of cracks present within the microstructure of the coating. To ensure operation in the mild regime, continuous sliding under operating pressures of above 7. 84 MPa should be avoided. Abrasive wear simulated by the diamond-on-flat test increased with load. However, the failure mechanisms produced were independent of load and consist of a combination of plastic deformation and brittle fracture with plastic deformation representing the rate controlling step in the wear process. Slurry erosion tests have shown that LW 45 wears by a brittle erosive mechanism and is therefore best able to resist erosion at low impingement angles. The volume loss per particle impact for LW 45 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the impinging particles. The failure mechanism involved the growth of cracks in the microstructure by a fatigue action eventually leading to crack interlinking and material fall out. For all wear conditions, it is suggested that the removal of microcracking from the coating microstructure will lead to significant improvements in wear performance. A simplified design guide has been produced that gives a weighted importance to the various failure modes attributable to the respective tests. A significant improvement in performance was recorded by LW 45 in comparison to typical substrate materials such as AISI 410 and Ferralium F 255 stainless steels. SER...|$|E
