5|$|Food {{politics}} are the political {{aspects of the}} production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food. The politics can {{be affected by the}} ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations.

5|$|Food power <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the {{politics}} of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power {{has been used as a}} weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Canada {{has been}} {{influenced}} by British, French, and indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity. During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. Canadian humour <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Many Canadian comedians have archived international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.|$|E

Even after the family partition, Rudok continued {{to be part of}} Ladakh. Maryul meaning lowlands <b>was</b> <b>a</b> name given to a part of Ladakh.

5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway numbers <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the {{designation}} and included on the diamond-shaped reassurance markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and {{continues to this day}} in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{designed}} for a pre-school audience, featuring five performers who educate and entertain through music, movement and play. Music <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the series with the band's pop appeal resonating in the program. The segments of the show are based on an educational model. The original cast was composed of Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. This line-up had been completely phased out {{by the end of}} 2008 and were replaced with a new line-up of performers. Hi-5 received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program.|$|E
5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the narrative; the best {{examples}} being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and Oriya (East India) renditions of the Ramayana, but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E

5|$|Meditation <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the rosary. This mode of {{meditation}} {{is the process}} of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice {{of meditation}} during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} Kerala is {{composite}} and cosmopolitan {{in nature and}} it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of Indian culture. It is synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people. It has been elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala {{from the rest of}} the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E

5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties {{are more susceptible to}} persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Saint Lucia {{is home to}} many vibrant oral and folk traditions {{and is based on}} {{elements}} derived from the music of Africa, especially rhythmically, and Western Europe, dances like the quadrille, polka and waltz. The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, especially a four-stringed banjo called the bwa poye. Celebratory songs called jwé show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril. Music <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia, and the country's popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.|$|E
