5|$|After {{retiring}} <b>from</b> <b>Congress,</b> Hastert made occasional {{public appearances}} on political programs. He also made some endorsements of political candidates; in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, he endorsed Mitt Romney {{instead of his}} predecessor as Speaker, Newt Gingrich.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett <b>from</b> <b>Congress.</b> The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E
5|$|By 2008 many Democrats were {{considering}} this approach {{as the basis}} for healthcare reform. Experts said that the legislation that eventually emerged <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dan Boren (D-OK-2) retired <b>from</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{therefore}} {{making the}} seat vacant. This district, which covers most of Little Dixie, is the Democrats' best {{region of the}} state, and has been represented by a Democrat for a dozen years. Republican Markwayne Mullin won the election, making the state's congressional delegation entirely Republican.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, after Hastert had {{departed}} <b>from</b> <b>Congress,</b> the highway project was killed after federal regulators retracted the 2008 approval {{of an environmental}} impact statement for the project and agreed to an Illinois Department of Transportation request to redirect the funds for other projects. Environmentalists, who opposed the project, celebrated its cancellation.|$|E

5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> the following year.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired <b>from</b> <b>Congress,</b> so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> party membership. He did not {{disagree with}} the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would {{get a chance to}} make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E

On February 8, 2013, Jackson admitted to violating federal campaign law by using campaign funds to make personal purchases. Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013, to one count of wire and mail fraud. On August 14, 2013, he was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 1777, {{money from}} the Continental Congress arrived in Trenton and the men were paid. Washington also {{received}} a series of resolves <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> including one that gave Washington powers {{similar to those of}} a military dictator. Washington decided that he would stand and fight at Trenton, and ordered General John Cadwalader, who was at Crosswicks with 1,800 militia, to join him in Trenton. On December 31 Washington learned that an army of 8,000 men under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1787, the Second Continental Congress {{passed the}} Northwest Ordinance, {{creating}} the Northwest Territory which included Michigan. In 1805, the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory, with Detroit as its territorial capital. Michigan first applied for statehood {{as early as}} 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, a 468-square mile (1,210km²) area that included the important port city of Toledo. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> to do so. The state's boundaries included the contested area.|$|E

5|$|On May 13, 1800, President John Adams {{appointed}} Harrison as {{the governor}} of the newly established Indiana Territory, based on his ties to the west and seemingly neutral political stances. Harrison, caught unaware, was reluctant to accept the position until he received assurances from the Jeffersonians {{that he would not be}} removed from office after they gained power in the upcoming elections. After Harrison's governorship was confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he resigned <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> to become the first Indiana territorial governor in 1801.|$|E
5|$|On {{that date}} 48 bombers, under secret {{orders from the}} president, crossed into Cambodian {{airspace}} and delivered their payloads in Operation Breakfast. During the next 14 months this operation was followed by Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Dessert, and Supper as American bombers flew 3,630 sorties and expended 100,000 tons of ordnance on the Base Areas in {{what came to be}} called Operation Menu. During this time frame, the entire program was held as a closely guarded secret <b>from</b> <b>Congress,</b> the American people, and amazingly, from the Air Force itself.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force {{changed the}} program to full weapon {{development}} and awarded a contract for an XB-70 prototype and 11 YB-70s in August 1960. In November 1960, the B-70 program received a $265million appropriation <b>from</b> <b>Congress</b> for FY 1961. Nixon, trailing {{in his home state}} of California, also publicly endorsed the B-70, and on 30 October Eisenhower helped the Republican campaign with a pledge of an additional $155million for the B-70 development program.|$|E
