2500|$|After {{the award}} had been given, the L.A. Timess Bob Sipchen, who opposed Iversen, {{then went on}} to extract quotes from {{precisely}} the five students his paper had awarded, even though none of those students had ever met Iversen, getting one ex-Wolfpacket staffer to say that Iversen was [...] "exaggerating everything that happened and blatantly lying about his experience." [...] The only student Sipchen interviewed who actually knew Iversen said that the book was “dead on.” [...] Sipchen came under attack for his journalistic integrity with this technique, leading pundit Dr. Blogstein to write, “Butter up your sources with prizes and then get quotes to support your opinion. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> legal?” Shortly thereafter, Sipchen was bought out by Times management to quit and departed to work at the Sierra Club newsletter, of which exit 39-year Times veteran Ken Reich wrote, “Not such a loss is Bob Sipchen, whose ill-informed educational column was the latest in a whole series of assignments he had filled unsuccessfully.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 83rd minute, {{with the}} score at 1–1, referee Roberto Rosetti called a foul against Spain's Carles Puyol. France's Thierry Henry went down holding his face, {{although}} Puyol appeared {{to hit him}} in the chest. Patrick Vieira scored from the resulting free kick and France won the match 3–1. [...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong." [...] Spain coach Luis Aragonés also called the foul [...] "non-existent". But Henry said, [...] "Puyol came up to me afterwards and apologised so <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cheating?" [...] He also told reporters, [...] "Look at the replay, their left-back was going to take the ball and Puyol came across me and blocked me. If that's basketball that's a good block, but we're not playing basketball. In my head I'm not a guy who does go down or cheats." [...] Television announcer and former Netherlands international Ruud Gullit said of the play, [...] "I am a little bit disappointed. It shows that cheating works." ...|$|E

5000|$|Phenomenology is a {{philosophical}} method of inquiry of everyday experience.
