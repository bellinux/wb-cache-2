Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of <b>grout.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E

500|$|Ralph P. Locke, in {{his study}} of Carmen's origins, draws {{attention}} to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. <b>Grout,</b> <b>in</b> his History of Western Music, praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: [...] "Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head." [...] Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; [...] "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique.|$|E

60|$|No {{doubt there}} are many people who will be deeply {{interested}} to know that Rossetti was once chased round his garden by an infuriated zebu he was trying to exhibit to Mr. Whistler, or that he had a great affection for a dog called 'Dizzy,' or that 'sloshy' was one of his favourite words of contempt, or that Mr. Gosse thought him very like Chaucer in appearance, or that he had 'an absolute disqualification' for whist-playing, or that he was very fond of quoting the Bab Ballads, or that he once said that if he could live by writing poetry he would see painting d---d! For our part, however, we cannot help expressing our regret that such a shallow and superficial biography as this should ever have been published.

Better, after all, that we knew a painter only through his vision and a poet through his song, than that the image of a great man should be marred and made mean for us by the clumsy geniality of good intentions.

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{complication}} of <b>grouting</b> process <b>in</b> soil, design of fracture grouting works is still mainly based on empirical considerations and experiences from past projects. Based {{on the theory}} of particle flow, the domain of flow is defined by using Fish language implemented in PFC and the formulas for flow and pressure are put forward respectively. Combined with above study, the process of fracture <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> soil is simulated with particle flow code (PFC 2 D) from micro-viewpoint under coupling environment. In addition, the emergence and development of crack and <b>grouting</b> pressure <b>in</b> soil is analyzed under different grouting pressure and soil properties. The research results show that pressure {{plays a key role}} in consolidating the soil by fracture <b>grouting,</b> but <b>in</b> fact it should be kept in a reasonable value in order to forming grouting slurry net entirely. Filed test indicates that fracture grouting greatly increases the bearing capacity of weathered rock in Xiamen Xiang’an subsea tunneling and the conclusions of numerical simulation agrees well with the field test and grouting theory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{experimental}} research on compensation <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> sand. It is investigated in model tests, how {{the shape of}} the grout bodies made during injection depends on the grout properties, the density of the sand and the way the tubes are installed. The shape of the grout body affects the necessary injection pressure and whether heave is localised to one injection point or distributed over a wider area. An analytical model is developed that shows the influence of various parameters. The evaluation of field measurements shows the influence of soil disturbance. Soil disturbance in a layer of sand may lead to a decrease in density of the sand and compensation <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> such a layer will have a lower efficiency (a lot of grout has to be injected to create some heave) and long term settlements are possible.

40|$|One of way {{to fulfill}} of water {{requirements}} is build of dam. Soil or rocks of dam based foundation {{are not always}} comply with criteria of planning. To complete the criteria of planning, so improvement the weak zones must be done for stronger/stable foundation and no leakage in foundation. One of method to improvement soil/rock is grouting.

Effective Depth of <b>grouting</b> should known <b>in</b> order to perform <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> effective, efficient and economic. Data of field observation which used in determination for effective depth, are drill log, core drill log, permeability test, and section along dam.

Data of grouting depth and leak debit used to create a graphic. Based on relationship graphic of grouting depth and leak debit identified that effective depth of curtain <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> case study of Gonggang dam is 35 meter with leakage debit is 2, 21 liter/second After the safety number for leakage to each profile counted, actually, there are many profile with safety number are less one.

For safety or the safety numbers are more than one, then the most effective and efficient way that is decrease permeability coefficient value (k) after grouting from the initial k< 5, 71 x 10 - 5 cm/second to be k  2 x 10 - 5 cm/second. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{feature of}} the Pembrokeshire style of roof {{are a number of}} {{prominent}} vertical ridges {{on the outside of the}} roof. These are caused by barbed wire being stretched over the roof before grouting. The wire can be firmly attached to the structure and the barbs on the wire act as a mechanical key to retain the <b>grout</b> <b>in</b> place. Over time and repeated re-grouting, the wires are lost beneath ridges that build up. Barbed wire was used because it was conveniently available to remote farming communities and performed well. It was not manufactured until the 1870s and so this style of roof is newer than the first use of grouting, even with cement.|$|E

40|$|Coal-measure {{mudstone}} is {{a typical}} dual-porosity media, and <b>grouting</b> <b>in</b> a matrix system is dominantly controlled by the imbibition effect for silica sol. This paper studies the imbibition effect using mudstone in the Huaibei mining area and silica sol as grouting material as an example. Groutability, driving force, and diffusion difficulty affecting the imbibition effect were tested by a mercury porosimeter, nanoparticle size analyzer, optical contact-angle measuring device, surface tension meter, and rotary viscosity meter. After finely grinding a mudstone sample, a pressureless imbibition process was conducted through nuclear magnetic resonance equipment for 216 h to study colloid spontaneous migration and phase characteristics. Results show that silica sol absorption rate follows a power function and that the spectrograms of T 2 are distributed in a triple peak pattern, with a tendency {{to move to the}} right of vertex time.
