5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, one <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it, {{and that was}} the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E

500|$|Loves of a Blonde {{sold out}} in theaters {{throughout}} Czechoslovakia, and its extraordinary success has been attributed, at least in part, to its {{being one of the}} first eastern European films to include an extended sex scene that involved nude performers.

Forman was later to say: [...] "The award from the first communist president of the land and a legendary boozer was more of an embarrassment than anything else.

There {{are just going to}} be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something.

500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date. The complete album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the Internet.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dancehall Queen" [...] was {{directed}} by Diplo, Red Foxx and Pomp It premiered on 29 November 2010 via Robyn's official YouTube account. Ryan Staake of Pomp referred the video to as a [...] "really weird VHS/karaoke video". The video resembles a faded karaoke tape with occasional sing-along lyrics {{on the bottom of}} the screen. Robyn does not appear in the video. Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is [...] "complete with awkward/sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life". Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip, stating, [...] "We’re guessing Robyn didn’t want the “hassle” of appearing, so instead we’re treated to—seemingly—random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women as the words of the chorus appear karaoke-style on the screen. We can say one <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the flick, if you were confused about the song’s lyrics, they’re fairly easy to read." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the novel's publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stunning Lee. It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962. Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned that attention she received bordered {{on the kind of}} publicity celebrities sought. Since then, she declined talking with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: [...] "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble." ...|$|E

500|$|King {{has since}} been {{critical}} of his performance, which he describes as his [...] "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as [...] "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he [...] "didn't participate as much because of that". [...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but the <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> having two guitar players that can write music {{is that you are}} never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels [...] vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and [...] "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: [...] "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E

Sarah Wyland of Great American Country felt that Aldean was professional in handling the technical problem by continuing to sing the song with Clarkson. However, Natalie Maines, the lead vocalist of the Dixie Chicks, lambasted Aldean's performance in her Twitter account, writing [...] "Well the <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> his mic going out is suddenly the song got a lot more in tune."

You'll get tired just watching it." [...] Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that the <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the DVD is that it has a [...] "wider range of songs", nevertheless {{they do not have the}} same [...] "rump-rattling power" [...] of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, for instance [...] "Bootylicious". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that although Beyoncé showed an emotional side of herself during the DVD, [...] "Still, the shows go on in their high-heeled, wonderfully choreographed glory." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Amos {{formed a}} musical group called Y Kant Tori Read, named for her {{difficulty}} sight reading. In addition to Amos, {{the group was}} composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. The band went through several iterations of songwriting and recording; Amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time. Finally, in July 1988, the band's self-titled debut album, Y Kant Tori Read, was released.

We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively.
