5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} laid out around a large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the buttery and <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E
25|$|In the west, {{the outer}} wall was {{immediately}} {{adjacent to the}} inner moat and comprised five small bastions. The castle was entered through a gatehouse in the northern outer wall, comprising a guardhouse west of the gateway {{that led to the}} courtyard, and the stables in its eastern part, where also a well was located. A second drawbridge, made from copper according to legend, spanned the outer moat in front of the gatehouse. Two other separate buildings stood on the courtyard - a chapel to the south and a <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The castle was finished in 1579.|$|E

25|$|The Hetton Silver Band Hall {{opened in}} 2013, and {{features}} displays reflecting the role colliery bands played in mining life. Built in 1912, it was relocated {{from its original}} location in South Market Street, Hetton-le-Hole, where it {{was used by the}} Hetton Silver Band, founded in 1887. They built the hall using prize money from a music competition, and the band decided to donate the hall to the museum after they merged with Broughtons Brass Band of South Hetton (to form the Durham Miners' Association Brass Band). It {{is believed to be the}} only purpose built band hall in the region. The structure consists of the main hall, plus a small <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear; as part of the museum it is still used for performances.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to {{a member of the national}} committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E

[...] Behind the parlor is an office space where Sergeant would have met with Indians. [...] A diversion from the typical Georgian plan is the presence of a second entrance {{on the right side of}} the house, and a narrow hallway running from that entrance to the office. [...] This made it possible for Sergeant's Indian visitors to reach his office without passing through the front of the house. [...] The front door is adorned with a remarkably well-preserved specimen of a Connecticut River valley front door pediment.|$|E

Julia's Kitchen was a restaurant inside the Copia building that focused on seasonal dishes and was named for honorary trustee Julia Child, who loaned part of her <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restaurant, a wall of 49 pans, pots, fish molds, and other tools and objects. Within a year of the center's closing, the items {{were sent to the}} Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, where they are included in the Julia Child's kitchen exhibit, which up until that point was only missing that portion. The restaurant had a [...] dining room (for 180 seats), an outdoor seating area (...) and a [...] kitchen.

This group had been meeting informally since 1905, but was officially established in 1911.

2500|$|In 1900 Edward Bok of the Curtis Publishing Company, bent on {{improving}} American homes, invited architects to publish designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, the plans of which readers could purchase for five dollars.

The Carver bowed so often that I truly think that during the feast he bowed at least 3,000 times." ...|$|E
