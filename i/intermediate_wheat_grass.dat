MethodsMemory impairment was induced by aluminum chloride (4. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) for 28 d. Memory function was assessed by Morris water maze test. To study the activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (100 mg/kg, p. o.), Wistar rats were administered it for 28 d along with aluminum chloride. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were estimated in brain after the treatment. ResultsThe major {{finding of this study}} is that aluminum enhanced oxidative stress. <b>Wheat</b> <b>grass</b> showed a significant improvement in reduction of this oxidative stress by reduction of malondialdehyde levels and enhancement of superoxide dismutase and catalase levels. ConclusionsThe present study clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> that shows good antioxidant properties, and this remarkable effect of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> may act as a key to treat Alzheimer's disease...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{increases}} in multidrug-resistant pathogens {{has become a}} challenge to the researcher to develop newer natural and active components to combat these problems in future. Hence this study was undertaken to determine the anti-microbial activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Triticum aestivum) extract against Gram-positive bacteria. Materials and Methods: Experimental design, in vitro study, lab setting. <b>Wheat</b> <b>grass</b> powder (T. aestivum) was obtained from the pharmacy in Belgaum city. Ethanolic extract of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> powder was prepared by cold extract method. The extract was then diluted by inert solvent, dimethyl formaldehyde, to obtain different concentration of extract. The extract, along with the concentrations of range 1 - 10, was then subjected to microbiological investigation to determine which concentration of the extract will give a wider inhibition zone against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Results: Minimum inhibitory concentration by broth dilution method was found to be 5 % of extract for S. mutans and 1. 25 % for Lactobacillus spp. Conclusion: <b>Wheat</b> <b>grass</b> extract demonstrated anti-microbial activity against S. mutans and Lactobacillus spp...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of the research, we {{determined}} selenium and dry matter content of 35 <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and 35 <b>wheat</b> seed samples. The selenium content of the preparation plant probes was measured by spectrofluorimetric determination (λexcitation = 380 nm, λemission = 519 nm) of the resulted piazselenol complex. It was established that between the selenium content of the <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and <b>wheat</b> seed the correlation coefficient was 0. 36 at p = 0. 05 level, which indicates a medium-close correlation. Similarly, there was a medium-close correlation between the selenium content of the <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> calculated on dry-matter basis and total selenium content of the wheat, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 40 at p = 0. 02 level. Afterwards, beside the selenium content, we measured the selenomethionine content by ion-exchange chromatography and highperformance liquid chromatography, and the organic selenium content was calculated. A very close correlation was established between the total selenium, selenomethionine and calculated organic selenium content of wheat (the correlation coefficients were between 0. 92 and 0. 99 at p = 0. 01 level). The correlation between the selenomethionine content of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and <b>wheat</b> seed was very weak (r = 0. 23) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{crude enzyme}} extract of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> was heated at 60 degrees C for 30 min, {{followed}} by ammonium sulfate fractionation and isoelectric chromatofocusing on Polybuffer exchanger (PBE 94) for purification. The purified peroxidase was then characterized for its catalytic characteristics. It {{was found that}} AgNO 3 at a concentration of 0. 25 mM and MnSO 4 and EDTA at concentrations of 5 mM significantly inhibited the activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> peroxidase. However, KCl, NaCl, CuCl 2, CaCl 2, ZnCl 2, and MgCl 2 at concentrations of 5. 0 mM and HgCl 2 at a concentration of 0. 25 mM enhanced enzyme activity. Chemical modification significantly influenced the activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> peroxidase. Particularly, N-bromosuccinimide (5 mM) inhibited 16 % of the enzyme activity, whereas N-acetylimidazole (2. 5 mM), diethyl pyrocarbonate (2. 5 mM), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (2. 5 mM) enhanced by 18 - 29 % of the enzyme activity. Such results implied that tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, and serine residues are related to enzyme activity. The pH optima for <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> peroxidase to catalyze the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD), catechol, pyrogallol, and guaiacol were 5. 0, 4. 5, 6. 5, and 5. 0, respectively. The apparent K-m values for OPD, catechol, pyrogallol, and guaiacol were 2. 9, 18. 2, 2. 5, and 3. 8 mM, respectively. Under optimal reaction conditions, <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> peroxidase catalyzed the oxidation of OPD (an aromatic amine substrate) 3 - 11 times more rapidly than guaiacol, catechol, and pyrogallol (phenolic substrates containing one to three hydroxy groups in the benzene ring) ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the immune}} system of shrimps is not {{comparable}} to that of vertebrates, shrimps can acquire protection against pathogenic challenge by building up immunity. In this study, formalin-inactivated virus (FIV) was administered by injection, bath-immersion, or orally to determine levels of vaccination-mediated protection against the pathogenic white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Diets supplemented with alfalfa, methyl sulfonyl methane (MSM), or <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> were provided with or without FIV. Shrimp injected with FIV and challenged 3, 15, or 30 days after vaccination had cumulative and relative survivals of 83 %, 67 %, and 33 %, respectively. Survival of shrimp challenged by bath-immersion 3 - 45 days after vaccination by immersion was significantly higher than in the unvaccinated control. Orally vaccinated shrimp challenged by bath-immersion were partially protected up to 45 days after vaccination (cumulative survival 63. 7 %, relative 61. 7 %) but not til 60 days after vaccination (cumulative 8 %, relative 3. 2 %). Survival of unvaccinated shrimp challenged by bath-immersion improved when shrimp were fed a diet supplemented with <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> or MSM, but not alfalfa.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of trinexapac ethyl concentrations (0, 250 and 500 g/h) and traffic stress (traffic and non traffic) treatments on <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> physiological and morphological traits, an experiment was conducted on research farm of Isfahan University of Technology in 2011 - 2012 as factorial in completely randomized designs with three replications. The studied traits involved plant height and plant density, shoot dry weight and fresh weights, tillering, chlorophyll level, roots and shoot dissolved carbohydrates. Results showed that Trinexapac ethyl reduced plant height, fresh weight and dry weight of cut parts significantly. Application of 250 and 500 g/h Trinexapac ethyl decreased plant height by 21. 23 percent and 31. 85 percent respectively. Application of Trinexapac ethyl improved plant height, tillering and chlorophyll level. In contrast, chlorophyll level was decreased substantially under traffic treatment and this treatment did not affect <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> density and tillering significantly. Under 500 g/h Trinexapac ethyl treatment, tillering was increased by 36 percent compared with under control condition one.

40|$|Many {{profound}} changes in mid-continental grasslands {{have resulted from}} the recent extended drought. In the prairies of eastern Nebraska, Kansas and South Dakota, the earlier continuous stands of bluestem (Andropogon scoparius and A. furcatus) have often been greatly fragmented and now occur as relict patches a few square feet to many square rods in extent. Loss of approximately 95 per cent of little bluestem has left the prairie cover very open. Over large areas, except for weeds and a few surviving grasses and forbs, the soil was bared (Weaver, Stoddart and Noll, 1935; Weaver and Albertson, 1939). Grasses more xerophytic than the bluestems have greatly increased, notably needle grass (Stipa spartea), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis) and western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Agropyron smithii). The <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> has entirely replaced other grasses in many prairies and is such a vigorous competitor for water that its invasion into countless relict areas of weakened bluestems has gradually resulted in their disappearance together {{with most of the}} accompanying forbs...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) is a {{potential}} soil contaminant {{in many parts of}} the world where it can pose a health risk to livestock and wildlife. Phosphate ore mining in Southeast Idaho has resulted in numerous waste rock dumps revegetated with forages to stabilize the dumps and support grazing. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), and western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve] are the dominant forage species on these lands. To demonstrate the feasibility of using sulfur (S) as a soil amendment to restrict plant Se uptake, 3 kg pots containing 50 : 50 w/w soil and waste shale were uniformly mixed with 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 Mg ha− 1 S as either elemental S or gypsum. Pots were seeded with alfalfa or western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass.</b> Dry mass and tissue Se were monitored over several clippings. Soils were sampled at the conclusion of the study and analyzed for water-soluble, oxalate-extractable, and total Se. Sulfur amendments as either elemental S or gypsum at 1. 0 Mg ha− 1 or greater equally suppressed Se uptake over 60 % in both forage species. Alfalfa accumulated more Se than western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass.</b> Plant removal via successive clippings resulted in lower tissue Se accumulation over time than the use of S soil amendments alone. Alfalfa-planted soils contained lower water-soluble and oxalate-extractable Se than did the non-planted controls while western wheat grass-planted soils contained lower water-soluble Se. Applying S to these shale-based soils may be an economically viable option for treating Se-impacted, revegetated lands...|$|R

In the protected area, aside from non-vegetated badlands, the primary vegetation cover is dry mixed grassland, with the dominant species being needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comate) and blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis). Other grassland species associated with the area include northern <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Agropyron dasystachyum), western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Pascopyrum smithii), prairie june grass (Koeleria macrantha), sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) and various sedge species.

40|$|Native {{pastures}} {{in eastern}} Nebraska and adjacent states have undergone profound changes {{as a result}} of drought. Bluestems (Andropogon) and associated grasses have been thinned and weakened, although recovery has been marked since 1941. In many pastures they were replaced by western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Agropyron smithii) or other invading species. In nearly all, <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> now occurs in considerable abundance. Kentucky bluegrass (Paa pratensis), into which many overgrazed native pastures had degenerated, was almost completely killed by the drought, or greatly damaged as in western Iowa. Despite these widespread changes, few studies have been made on the relative yields, preferences of stock, and consumption of forage in these several grazing types, and none where all three occurred in the same range or pasture. Consequently, in the fall of 1942, when a native bluestem pasture was found with a part of it degenerated into a good bluegrass sod and other portions covered with <b>wheat</b> <b>grass,</b> the present study was planned. Practical information on pastures, pasture grasses, and utilization of forage is much in demand. As pointed out by Allred (1941), the importance of livestock production at present assumes the deepest significance of historic time. A large part of livestock products must come from operators of native grasslands. The task of maintaining these grazing lands in a high state of productivity is fundamentally based upon a knowledge of the vegetation; in fact, a knowledge of native plants and forage conditions is vital to the successful management of pasture or range. Conservation of range land can be accomplished only by attention to correct grazing. Native prairie has been the home of grazing animals for untold centuries. Prairie plants are eminently adapted to grazing, and conservative grazing is little or no more harmful to native pastures than is total protection. But to maintain production, moderate grazing must be practiced. Forage production from a pasture in good condition may be several times as great as from one in an advanced degree of degeneration. Poor pastures, like poor crops, are expensive. (80 pages...|$|R
