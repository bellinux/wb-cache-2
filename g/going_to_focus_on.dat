Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was.

IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show.

500|$|The article {{revealed}} that early scripts {{for the movie}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was [...] "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," [...] and elaborating that, [...] "We {{wanted to see her}} struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory." [...] The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had [...] "creative" [...] and [...] "licensing" [...] walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: [...] "What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" [...] and further stated that [...] "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" [...] and at the end, Nintendo [...] "felt uncomfortable with our team [...] being the ones to propose those answers" [...] which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating {{at the end of the}} IGN interview that [...] "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" [...] and he {{revealed that}} [...] "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
