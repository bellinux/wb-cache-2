5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that {{was as close as}} they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2011, Challinor {{signed for}} Kettering's Conference Premier rivals York City on a {{contract}} until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a position in which he displayed composure {{and an ability to}} start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area.|$|E

5|$|Originally budgeted at $400million, the new South Ferry station cost a {{total of}} $530million, {{with most of the}} money being a grant from the Federal Transit Administration {{earmarked}} for World Trade Center reconstruction. In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, with a new free transfer to between the 1 and the N, R, and W trains at the older Whitehall Street station. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E

Feyenoord made it 2–0 seven minutes later when Van Hooijdonk, scored a free kick <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, his eighth goal {{over the course}} of the season's competition.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.|$|E

5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E
5|$|Young was {{released}} by Halifax while they were enduring financial difficulties and on 4 January 2008 signed for Altrincham as a semi-professional on a contract {{until the end of}} 2007–08. He made his debut a day later as a 60th-minute substitute in a 4–0 defeat away to Oxford United and his full debut came after starting in a 2–1 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers on 8 January 2008. His only goal of the season came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area in a 2–1 defeat away to Burton Albion on 8 April 2008. He finished the season with 22 appearances and 1 goal for Altrincham and signed a new two-year contract in the summer of 2008.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city at Yonkers to 14th Street.

The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Stevenage, Byrom joined League One side Preston North End, then {{managed by}} Graham Westley, who had {{previously}} signed him for Stevenage. He signed on a free transfer. Byrom made his competitive debut for Preston in the club's 2–1 away victory over Bury, coming on as a second-half substitute. It took Byrom just three games to open his goalscoring account, scoring the first goal in the club's 5–0 win over Hartlepool United at Deepdale. In the club's following match four days later, on 22 September 2012, he netted in a 3–1 away defeat to Walsall, arriving unmarked {{in the area to}} give Preston an early lead in the match. His third and final goal of the campaign came at the beginning of November 2012, scoring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area in Preston's 3–0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town. Byrom made 27 appearances, eleven of which as a substitute, during his first season with the club, scoring three times.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{in both of}} Stevenage's opening fixtures of 2011–12, Charles signed a contract extension on 11 August 2011, keeping him contracted to the club until 2013. Two days later, Charles scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a close range header in a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield. Charles' appearances were sporadic throughout the remainder of 2011, with the player suffering from a knee injury. He made his first start in nearly two months in Stevenage's 1–0 away victory against Reading at the Madejski Stadium in the FA Cup on 7 January 2012, with Charles scoring the winning goal in the first-half with a finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. Charles' season ended prematurely after he suffered a hamstring injury in Stevenage's 1–1 draw with Wycombe Wanderers on 31 March 2012, with the injury ruling him out of action for up to six weeks. He made 34 appearances during the season, scoring five times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he came straight back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water {{and seemed to}} be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance {{and seemed to be}} pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time that season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Clásico, this time at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the {{historic}} match 2–6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0–5. On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule. On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time. Three days later, Real Madrid lost a league match and Barcelona was crowned La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
