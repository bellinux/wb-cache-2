Subjects and methods We studied 48 subjects: 12 (6 males) untreated AGHD (AGHDnt), 20 (10 males) treated AGHD (AGHDt) and 16 healthy subjects (8 males) as control group (CG). We measured urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (6 -SM) in total (24 h samples), nocturnal (6 -SMn) : 1800 - 0800 and diurnal samples (6 -SMd) : 0800 - 1800.

This enabled estimation {{of the importance of}} source water and of environmental factors at the ecosystem scale on variations of the isotopic composition of sedimentary n-alkanes. The ice core records from Dasuopu, Puruogangri and Rongbuk glacier of the past 1000 years recording the source water isotopes show a continuous deuterium enrichment indicating a warming trend or decreased precipitation. Sedimentary n-alkane <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> also represent the same general tendency to enrichment in heavier isotopes.

40|$|Stable {{hydrogen}} isotope ratios (<b>delta</b> D <b>values)</b> of methoxyl {{groups in}} lignin and pectin {{from a variety}} of plant types from different locations have been shown to mirror <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of precipitation, with a mean uniform isotopic fractionation. Since delta D in precipitation is mainly influenced by climatic conditions, including temperature, evaporation and precipitation amount, methoxyl groups of organic matter have been proposed as a potential palaeoclimate proxy. Here, we measured the <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of the methoxyl groups of sedimentary organic matter derived from sediment core segments of Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Germany). The sediment core covers the entire Holocene and part of the Late Glacial (until 13, 650 years BP). Since the sedimentary organic matter was indicated by organic source proxies of predominantly phytoplanktonic origin, we considered the <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of the methoxyl groups as a proxy for the <b>delta</b> D <b>value</b> of the lake water. Presently and probably during most of the Holocene, the <b>delta</b> D <b>value</b> of precipitation was primarily controlled by temperature (2 - 4. 5 parts per thousand/degrees C) as well as in isotopic equilibrium with the <b>delta</b> D <b>value</b> of the lake water. We used these modern temperature sensitivities of the Eifel region together with the measured <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of the methoxyl groups of the sedimentary organic matter to evaluate temperature changes recorded for the Holocene. The resulting mean temperature variance was found to be consistently less than 1. 8 - 4 degrees C and is broadly in line with that reported from the NGRIP ice core for the same period. The transition from the Holocene to the Late Glacial period was accompanied with more negative <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of the methoxyl groups (similar to 13 parts per thousand/for the Younger Dryas). Besides the association with temperature we assumed a higher susceptibility of the <b>delta</b> D <b>value</b> of Lake Holzmaar to evaporative enrichment during the Younger Dryas which could serve as an explanation for discrepancies reported for existing palaeoclimate/-hydrology records of the Eifel region. Our findings indicate that the <b>delta</b> D <b>values</b> of methoxyl groups have great potential for assisting with palaeoclimate and palaeohydrology, particularly when the organic matter is well characterized and of uniform origin.

50|$|PE files {{normally}} {{do not contain}} position-independent code. Instead they are compiled to a preferred base address, and all addresses emitted by the compiler/linker are fixed ahead of time. If a PE file cannot be loaded at its preferred address (because it's already taken by something else), the operating system will rebase it. This involves recalculating every absolute address and modifying the code {{to use the new}} values. The loader does this by comparing the preferred and actual load addresses, and calculating a <b>delta</b> <b>value.</b> This is then added to the preferred address {{to come up with the}} new address of the memory location. Base relocations are stored in a list and added, as needed, to an existing memory location. The resulting code is now private to the process and no longer shareable, so many of the memory saving benefits of DLLs are lost in this scenario. It also slows down loading of the module significantly. For this reason rebasing is to be avoided wherever possible, and the DLLs shipped by Microsoft have base addresses pre-computed so as not to overlap. In the no rebase case PE therefore has the advantage of very efficient code, but in the presence of rebasing the memory usage hit can be expensive. This contrasts with ELF which uses fully position-independent code and a global offset table, which trades off execution time against memory usage in favor of the latter.|$|E

Categorization {{of the site}} of right bun-dle branch injury as proximal or distal was made by determining the V-RVA interval. In 11 of the patients, the V-RVA interval was prolonged (> 35 msec), indicating proximal right bundle branch injury {{and in the other}} eight it was normal (< 35 msec), indicating distal bundle branch injury. Within 24 hours of the study, all patients were studied by M-mode echocardiography. Measurements were made of the tricuspid valve closure, mitral valve closure and the difference between the two, or the <b>delta</b> <b>value.</b> All but one patient with distal bundle branch injury had delta values of less than 40 msec (range 8 - 38 msec), while 10 of 11 patients with proximal bundle branch injury had delta values greater than 40 msec (range 41 - 116 msec).

Samples of complete feed, spray dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and corn dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed (5 g/sample) into scintillation vials and inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV. Samples were incubated at room temperature for up to 56 days. Aliquots were removed at various time points followed by preparing serial 10 -fold dilutions and inoculating in cell cultures to determine the amount of surviving virus. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model, which estimates a <b>delta</b> <b>value</b> indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. Delta values of various ingredients were compared and analyzed as to their nutrient composition. Soybean meal had the greatest <b>delta</b> <b>value</b> (7. 50 days) for PEDV (P < 0. 06) as compared with all other ingredients. High delta values (P < 0. 001) were observed in soybean meal for PDCoV (42. 04 days) and TGEV (42. 00 days).

The delta O- 18 and <b>delta</b> C- 13 <b>values</b> of soil carbonates from Spain and Crete show a strong degree of co-variance suggesting that they are being controlled by the same environmental factor. This is suggested to be aridity. <b>delta</b> O- 18 <b>values</b> are controlled by soil moisture evaporation whilst <b>delta</b> C- 13 <b>value</b> is controlled by soil moisture degassing, vegetation abundance and possible C- 3 /C- 4 vegetation inputs. The paper concludes by highlighting the fact that, although currently under-utilised, the delta O- 18 and <b>delta</b> C- 13 <b>values</b> of soil and groundwater carbonates have a huge potential for providing important palaeoenvironmental information from sites across Europe.
