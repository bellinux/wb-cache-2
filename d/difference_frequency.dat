25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. <b>Difference</b> <b>frequency</b> mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E

If the idler wave is given from the outside along with the pump beam, then the process is called <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> generation (DFG).

50|$|Intermodulation (IM) or {{intermodulation}} distortion (IMD) is the amplitude modulation of signals containing {{two or more}} different frequencies, caused by nonlinearities in a system. The intermodulation between each frequency component will form additional signals at frequencies that are not just at harmonic frequencies (integer multiples) of either, like harmonic distortion, but also at the sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the original frequencies and at multiples of those sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to stabilizing the carrier–envelope offset frequency is to cancel it completely {{by use of}} <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> generation (DFG). If the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> of light of opposite ends of a broadened spectrum is generated in a nonlinear crystal, the resulting frequency comb is carrier–envelope offset-free since the two spectral parts contributing to the DFG share the same carrier–envelope offset frequency. This was first proposed in 1999 [...] and recently demonstrated using an erbium fiber frequency comb at the telecom wavelength. This simple approach has the advantage that no electronic feedback loop is needed as in conventional stabilization techniques. It promises to be more robust and stable against environmental perturbations.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, difference-frequency {{generation}} (DFG) can be used. From {{light of}} {{opposite ends of}} the broadened spectrum the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> is generated in a nonlinear crystal, and a heterodyne beat between this mixing product and light at the same wavelength of the original spectrum is measured.

50|$|Also, the {{animation}} contains both up- and down-converted spectra, which {{is due to}} a frequency mixer producing both sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The local oscillator feedthrough is due to the imperfect isolation from the IF signal path in the mixer.|$|R
2500|$|Armstrong {{realized}} that this was a potential solution to the [...] "short wave" [...] amplification problem, since the beat frequency still retained its original modulation, but on a lower carrier frequency. To monitor a frequency of 1500kHz for example, he could set up an oscillator at, for example, 1560kHz, which would produce a heterodyne <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> of 60kHz, a frequency that could then be more conveniently amplified by the triodes of the day. He termed this the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] often abbreviated to [...] "IF".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the virtues}} of {{heterodyne}} detection is that the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> is generally far removed spectrally from the potential noises radiated {{during the process of}} generating either the signal or the LO signal, thus the spectral region near the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> may be relatively quiet. Hence, narrow electronic filtering near the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> is highly effective at removing the remaining, generally broadband, noise sources.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{point of}} {{contrast}} is the expected bandwidth {{of the signal}} and local oscillator. Typically, an RF local oscillator is a pure frequency; pragmatically, [...] "purity" [...] means that a local oscillator's frequency bandwidth is much {{much less than the}} <b>difference</b> <b>frequency.</b> With optical signals, even with a laser, it is not simple to produce a reference frequency sufficiently pure to have either an instantaneous bandwidth or long term temporal stability that is less than a typical megahertz or kilohertz scale <b>difference</b> <b>frequency.</b> For this reason, the same source is often used to produce the LO and the signal so that their <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> can be kept constant even if the center frequency wanders.|$|E
50|$|The {{harmonic}} mixer and subharmonic mixer are a type {{of frequency}} mixer, which is a circuit that changes one signal frequency to another. The ordinary mixer has two input signals and one output signal. If the two input signals are sinewaves at frequencies f1 and f2, then the output signal consists of frequency components at the sum f1+f2 and <b>difference</b> f1&minus;f2 <b>frequencies.</b> In contrast, the harmonic and subharmonic mixers form sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies</b> at a harmonic multiple {{of one of the}} inputs.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for the {{determination}} of optical frequencies in the near infrared {{that is based on}} the nonlinear generation of the optical sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies</b> of two near-infrared lasers followed by the comparison of the sum and <b>difference</b> <b>frequencies</b> with standards in the visible and in the far infrared, respectively. We also address questions of practicability and discuss some examples open to the method. The impressive stability exhibited by lasers locked to atomic and molecular standards has created a set of frequency fixed points, and some of these frequencies have been tied to the Cs-based def-inition of the second through the use of intri-cate frequency-transfer chains. Because of the complexity of such measurements, there is ample motivation both to exploit the standard frequen-cies already established by them and to find sim-pler frequency-measurement techniques applicable to general frequency targets.

5000|$|The {{amplitude}} of the down-mixed <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> can {{be larger than}} the {{amplitude of}} the original signal itself. The <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> signal {{is proportional to the}} product of the amplitudes of the LO and signal electric fields. Thus the larger the LO amplitude, the larger the difference-frequency amplitude. Hence there is gain in the photon conversion process itself.The first two terms are proportional to the average (DC) energy flux absorbed (or, equivalently, the average current in the case of photon counting). The third term is time varying and creates the sum and difference frequencies. In the optical regime the sum frequency will be too high to pass through the subsequent electronics. In many applications the signal is weaker than the LO, thus {{it can be seen that}} gain occurs because the energy flux in the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> [...] is greater than the DC energy flux of the signal by itself [...]|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} is spectral inversion, typically of speech; a carrier frequency is {{chosen to be}} above the highest speech frequencies (which are low-pass filtered at, say, 3 kHz, for a carrier of perhaps 3.3 kHz), and the sum frequencies from the modulator are removed by more low-pass filtering.

50|$|The CARS {{process can}} be {{physically}} explained by using either a classical oscillator model or by using a quantum mechanical model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) harmonic oscillator with a characteristic frequency of ωv. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> (ωp-ωS) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low combination tone when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> of two optical waves. When the <b>difference</b> <b>frequency</b> ωp-ωS approaches ωv, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ωp-ωS. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the probe beam. When the probe beam is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ωpr will now get modified to ωpr+ωp-ωS, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the probe beam, and can be detected in a separate direction.|$|E
