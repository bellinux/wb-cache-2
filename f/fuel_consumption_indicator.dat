Furthermore, in terms of objective functions mono-criterion or multi-criteria may be adopted. In this paper the coordination approach is implemented considering the multi-criteria optimisation at single junctions and mono-criterion optimisation at network level whereas the synchronisation is implemented considering the mono-criterion optimisation. The main purpose of {{the paper is the}} evaluation of the performances of two strategies not only considering indicators such as the total delay, the queue length etc. but also considering other indicators such as the emissions and the fuel consumption. The methodological framework is composed by three stages: (i) the decision variables (green timings and offsets) computation through optimisation methods; (ii) the implementation of optimal signal settings in a microscopic traffic flow simulator (“Simulation of Urban MObility”-SUMO); (iii) the estimation of emissions and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>indicator...</b>|$|E

40|$|Todayx 2019;s air {{transportation}} industry {{is faced with}} the challenge of maintaining a viable economic position in the face of unparalleled increase in fuel costs in combination with the ever-present threat of fuel supply shortages. The rapid increase of air traffic makes the problem regarding aviation fuel challenging. The aviation fuel prices comprise an important expenditure for the airliners. Hence, aircraft <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> becomes a relevant issue in the planning and analysis of aviation operations. The key elements that have major effect on <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> are aircraft design and operating methods. Another element that makes a major impact on the aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> is the aircraft delay caused by air traffic congestion. It is necessary to minimize aircraft delays in air and on ground and thereby minimize aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> This paper presents a method for the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation, which has fuel efficient trajectory as one of the interesting by-products. The method presented in this paper, uses <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information directly from the flight manual provided by the aircraft manufacturer to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> accurately using neural network approach. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information is collected from the pilotx 2019;s flight manual and segregated with respect to the different phases of flight like climb, cruise and descent.

40|$|Landscape fires {{occur on}} a large scale in (sub) {{tropical}} savannas and grasslands, affecting ecosystem dynamics, regional air quality and concentrations of atmospheric trace gasses. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> per unit of area burned is an important but poorly constrained parameter in fire emission modelling. We combined satellite-derived burned area with fire radiative power (FRP) data to derive <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates for land cover types with low tree cover in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia. We developed a new approach to estimate <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> based on FRP data from the polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in combination with MODIS burned-area estimates. The <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates based on the geostationary and polar-orbiting instruments showed good agreement in terms of spatial patterns. We used field measurements of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> to constrain our results, but the large variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> in both space and time complicated this comparison and absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates remained more uncertain. Spatial patterns in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> could be partly explained by vegetation productivity and fire return periods. In South America, most fires occurred in savannas with relatively long fire return periods, resulting in comparatively high <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> as opposed to the more frequently burning savannas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strikingly, we found the infrequently burning interior of Australia to have higher <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> than the more productive but frequently burning savannas in northern Australia. Vegetation type also {{played an important role in}} explaining the distribution of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> by affecting both fuel build-up rates and fire return periods. Hummock grasslands, which were responsible for a large share of Australian biomass burning, showed larger fuel build-up rates than equally productive grasslands in Africa, although this effect might have been partially driven by the presence of grazers in Africa or differences in landscape management. Finally, land management in the form of deforestation and agriculture also considerably affected <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> regionally. We conclude that combining FRP and burned-area estimates, calibrated against field measurements, is a promising approach in deriving quantitative estimates of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Satellite-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates may both challenge our current understanding of spatiotemporal <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> dynamics and serve as reference datasets to improve biogeochemical modelling approaches. Future field studies especially designed to validate satellite-based products, or airborne remote sensing, may further improve confidence in the absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates which are quickly becoming the weakest link in fire emission estimates...|$|R
