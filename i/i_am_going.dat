5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to do some serious things.|$|E
5|$|The story <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to tell is {{a horrible}} one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, as {{to making}} fun of you, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say--" [...] Mavering began, and after a pause he broke off with a laugh. [...] "I forget what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{took refuge}} in a silly, muttering sulkiness. It was nothing to me, he mumbled. I had told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> home. And since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> home he didn't see why he should. [...] .|$|R
50|$|A Lombard {{language}} {{tongue twister}} plays on Nàe being both {{the name of}} the town and a past tense of the verb nà (English to go, Italian andare): en dè ke nàe a Nàe go 'nkontràt el prèt de Nàe, 'l ma dìt endò ke nàe me go dìt ke nàe Nàe, which can <b>be</b> translated as: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Nave when I met the priest of Nave, he asked me where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> and <b>I</b> told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Nave.|$|R

25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} letter, to Blumentritt – Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am {{innocent}} {{of the crime}} of rebellion. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal {{is believed to be the}} first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown Litoměřice (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Miss Morse," [...] the Inspector said quietly, [...] "to {{find you}} so unsympathetic. Had I found you {{differently}} disposed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to ask you}} to put yourself in my place. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to ask you to}} look at these two tragedies {{from my point of view}} and from your own at the same time, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to ask you whether any possible motive suggested itself to you, any possible person or cause, which might be benefited by the removal of these two men." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the hall}} I met Quincey Morris, with a {{telegram}} for Arthur {{telling him that}} Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill, but <b>was</b> now <b>going</b> on better, and that Van Helsing and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> with her. <b>I</b> told him where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> and he hurried me out, but as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> said, ...|$|R
5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If my baby <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die, then I decided I {{would have to}} die, too. But if he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to grow up, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to see him grow up, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives." ...|$|R
25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think this}} ends the feud. But {{this is my}} warning—and {{this is not a}} threat, this is a promise! If either Stewart or Colbert {{mentions}} this again in any way, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> over to their tiny little studio, and I am kicking some Comedy Central ass!" ...|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned—if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned—if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to ask you}} about, Dave. I don't want to {{have that}} fellow bothering me. I told you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to turn over a new leaf." [...] And now for once in his life, Nat Poole looked Dave and then Ben {{squarely}} in the face.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 August 2010, de Marco gave an {{interview}} with Maltese newspaper The Times of Malta, in which he said: [...] "When I came round from the coma I no longer felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die. <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to remain. I'm here to stay ... for now at least." ...|$|R

500|$|At first Ezarik was {{considering}} producing a video {{series for the}} technology audience {{because they had been}} the most captive audience for online video series. She stated that she did not intend to broadcast what she considers private moments, noting [...] "That shouldn't be a problem. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to try as much as I can to do 24/7." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to speak on the class struggle and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. [...] But there {{has got to be a}} good deal of force to this thing of taking." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935 Kanae {{settled in}} Tokyo and {{returned}} to painting full-time. [...] He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery. [...] The show was well received and attended, and in a dinner that followed Kanae proclaimed, [...] "I shall live until May of my eighty-fifth year. [...] Therefore, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to sit back now, and drink sake, and paint to my heart's content." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother." [...] Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: [...] "Did {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to let him}} suppose we were piqued at his not coming? Did you suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to let him patronize us, or think {{that we were in}} the least {{dependent}} on his favor or friendship?" ...|$|R

500|$|Three {{months before}} he died, Hergé stated that [...] "Unfortunately I cannot say much about this {{forthcoming}} Tintin adventure because, though I started it three years ago, I have not had much {{time to work on}} it and still do not know how it will turn out. I know very roughly where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going...</b> I am continuing my research and I really do not know where this story will lead me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away." ...|$|E
500|$|When I told Gilbert he was {{so angry}} that I don't think he ever quite forgave me; he would not accept my health as an excuse, he was unreasonable, as, alas, he often was! 'You are a little fool!' he said. [...] 'I have often heard you say you don't like old women,' I retorted. [...] 'I shall soon be old. [...] Will you provide for me? [...] Will Sir Arthur? [...] Will Carte? [...] No, of course you won't. [...] Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to marry a man who will.' ...|$|E
5000|$|English translation: [...] "The it {{went out}} again and watched. I raised my hand. And the gentleman said: I've never seen a dog like this.

6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to observe, my dear Madam,"--here the {{resolute}} Clump {{once more}} interposed with a bland air--"what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to observe when you gave utterance to sentiments {{which do you}} so much honour, <b>was</b> that <b>I</b> think you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind friend, and sacrifice your own health too prodigally in her favour." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} week (9 November 2009), {{during an interview}} with Mary Hanafin, Alan O'Brien (who has a conviction from 2006 for incitement to hatred), {{a member of the}} audience, spent three minutes accusing Kenny of [...] "pontificating and moralising" [...] people on social welfare, despite being in receipt of a €600,000 salary. Then referring to a previous court case involving Kenny, he concluded by saying, [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to sue an old woman for a field because I feel I might make a million or more." [...] After being removed by security, the programme continued.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Beecham {{returned}} to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now (after his help in 1939) a self-governing co-operative, attempted to hire him {{on its own}} terms as its salaried artistic director. [...] "I emphatically refuse", concluded Beecham, [...] "to be wagged by any orchestra ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to found one more great orchestra to round off my career." [...] When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.|$|E
500|$|After Harrison's {{death in}} November 2001, McCartney {{said he was}} [...] "a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a {{wonderful}} sense of humour". He went on to say, [...] "We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together– that's what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother." [...] On {{the first anniversary of}} his death, McCartney played Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] on a ukulele at the Concert for George. He also performed [...] "For You Blue" [...] and [...] "All Things Must Pass", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".|$|E
5000|$|Fenn has {{described}} {{many of these}} early films as sexploitation films [...] "where directors tried to convince her to appear naked after the contract was signed." [...] In a February 1993 interview she explained,Still, I {{did a lot of}} movies instead of waitressing or that kind of thing at the beginning, and it wasn't as if I even took acting very seriously when <b>I</b> started. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in California for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to clubs, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> here, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> there, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> skipping acting classes when I could. Luckily, I had an agent who really believed in me and she just kept pushing me, thinking something would happen.|$|R

It would have needed something more than sea-sickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising.|$|R
