40|$|As {{mnemonic}} utilization {{deficit in}} older adults associates with age-related decline in executive function, {{we hypothesized that}} memory strategy <b>training</b> combined with <b>executive</b> function <b>training</b> might induce larger training effect in memory and broader training effects in non-memory outcomes than pure memory training. The present study compared the effects of combined cognitive <b>training</b> (<b>executive</b> function <b>training</b> plus memory strategy training) to pure memory strategy training. Forty healthy older adults {{were randomly assigned to}} a combined cognitive training group or a memory strategy training group. A control group receiving no training was also included. Combined cognitive training group received 16 sessions of training (eight sessions of <b>executive</b> function <b>training</b> followed by eight sessions of memory strategy training). Memory training group received 16 sessions of memory strategy training. The results partly supported our hypothesis in that indeed improved performance on executive function was only found in combined training group, whereas memory performance increased less in combined training compared to memory strategy group. Results suggest that combined cognitive training may be less efficient than pure memory training in memory outcomes, though the influences from insufficient training time and less closeness between <b>trained</b> <b>executive</b> function and working memory could not be excluded; however it has broader training effects in non-memory outcomes.
