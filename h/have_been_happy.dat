5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{an injury}} to pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> for England to continue batting so that his top order {{would not have to}} bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E
5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though he would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E

5|$|In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is {{not known}} what the boy's name was, but he died in {{childhood}} in 83. Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of Augusta upon Domitia, while their son was deified, appearing as such on the reverse of coin types from this period. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly exiled Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. By 84, Domitia {{had returned to the}} palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the amphitheatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her. It {{is not known}} whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Zewditu had two further marriages, both brief, before marrying Ras Gugsa Welle. Gugsa Welle was {{the nephew}} of Empress Taytu, Zewditu's stepmother. Zewditu had already been on good terms with Taytu, but the {{establishment}} of a direct tie between the two helped cement the relationship. Unlike her prior marriages, Zewditu's marriage to Gugsa Welle is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E

Carrie, too, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy,</b> but Mrs. Winter imagined she <b>was</b> not <b>happy</b> now. Although the girl had grit and would play her part well, Mrs. Winter did not mean to let her wait for Jim's wedding.|$|R

Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E

25|$|The Bengals {{were also}} a team on the rebound. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, quarterback Boomer Esiason and head coach Sam Wyche had openly feuded, and the team {{finished}} with a miserable 4–11 record. A lot of Bengals fans would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to see them both leave the team, but they worked out their differences in the offseason, and Esiason ended up having the best season of his career en route to Super Bowl XXIII. During the regular season, he threw for 3,572 yards and 28 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions, while also rushing for 248 {{yards and a touchdown}} on 43 carries. Esiason's performance made him the top-rated quarterback in the league with a 97.4 passer rating and earned him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, {{and even then}} {{he appears to have}} taken this step at the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. The object of his choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, the daughter of a Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy,</b> though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E

25|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia {{brought up}} her {{children}} with simplicity and more freedom than she received from her parents, and would {{keep a close}} relationship with them. She spoke French to her husband and English with her children. She was a keen tennis player, with her own tennis court at the Villa Wenden. She loved Italian music, particularly the operas of Puccini, and the theater. Her extant letters reveal a warm, caring person, who always seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> about life. She frequented many other European royals who stayed at the Riviera; her parents and brothers were also frequent visitors. Her mother {{died of a heart attack}} in 1891, and Anastasia remained very close to her widower father and her brothers, particularly the two eldest Nicholas and Michael. Anastasia spent lavishly from the Grand Duke's income and her own dowry, for which she was widely criticized, but she loved to shock people who condemned her. She liked society and became a frequent visitor to the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, losing a large sum of money at the casino; but in spite of her extravagances, she never lost her husband's affection.|$|E

500|$|Simpson in his {{adolescence}} {{was described}} as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, {{he would come back}} on the descent. Simpson's risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: [...] "When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes ride up the advertising boards {{at the top of the}} bankings, Wall of Death-style, to please the crowds." [...] Simpson's death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a near-death experience during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: [...] "He said he felt peace of mind and wasn't afraid to die.

500|$|The {{final section}} was {{dedicated}} at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 15, 2010, which marked the official opening to traffic. Final work was {{continued through the}} end of that month to complete the Hurricane River Bridge. Since the road was completed, traffic has increased. After paving, the new road has reduced travel times between Munising and Grand Marais from 90 to 45minutes. Not all residents <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> with the updated H-58; thousands of nails have been scattered along the road, and have led to flat tires on many vehicles. Police said at the time they believed it was intentional, but had no motive for the vandalism. Since the thoroughfare has re-opened, motorcyclists now frequent the highway, and a local group has named H-58 [...] "one of the top five motorcycling roads in Upper Michigan", and it has been promoted by the American Motorcyclist Association in their guidebooks; riders enjoy the 198curves and scenic vistas along the road.|$|E
500|$|Jane Guildford {{was born}} in Kent in about 1508/1509, the only {{daughter}} of Sir Edward Guildford and Eleanor West, daughter of Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr. Her schooling occurred at home together with her brother Richard and her future husband, who was her father's ward from 1512. In 1525, at about 16, she married Sir John Dudley, who was 20 or 21 years old. The match had been arranged by their parents some years before. Jane Dudley gave birth to 13 children, eight boys and five girls. In most cases {{it is impossible to}} establish their birthdates exactly. An exception is Robert, the future favourite of Elizabeth I; he {{was born in}} 1532 as the fifth son, and possibly after the eldest daughter Mary, who became the mother of the courtier-poet Philip Sidney. The family life of John and Jane Dudley seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> and was free from any scandals; around 1535 a poem praised the [...] "love and devotion" [...] of their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Having {{admired her}} {{performance}} in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page {{in the lead}} role, saying that when he read the screenplay {{for the first time}} he pictured her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had [...] "in mind right from the start" [...] were Olivia Thirlbywho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Junoand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: [...] "This is a movie that’s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn’t make sense." ...|$|E
