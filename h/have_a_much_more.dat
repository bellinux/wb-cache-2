Eleven of the 21 species {{exist in the}} wild only in Australia, while seven species occur only in the islands of the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Interestingly, no cockatoo species are found in Borneo (despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi) or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand, Dacians have {{a significant role in}} creating a history of an ethnically pure origin for Romanian people. However, at the same time, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> relegated role in describing Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation, less so than Romans do.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend {{to remain in}} shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Himalayas <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{sophisticated}} geomorphic {{history and}} pervasive topographic features than the Central Himalayas.

Most of the Sub-Himalayas are in Nepal; a small portion reaches into Sikkim, India and a fragment is in the southern half of Bhutan.|$|E
25|$|The exact set of GCC {{optimizations}} {{varies from}} release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as loop optimization, jump threading, common subexpression elimination, instruction scheduling, and so forth. The RTL optimizations are of less importance {{with the addition}} of global SSA-based optimizations on GIMPLE trees, as RTL optimizations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> limited scope, and have less high-level information.|$|E

25|$|Quite {{differently}} {{designed by}} Piermarini in 1787 was the Porta Orientale, later renamed the Porta Venezia. Its two customs houses were completed by Rodolfo Vantini in 1828. Characterized by three Doric portals {{on the outer}} side facing the ramparts, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> monumental look than the other customs houses in Milan and are also far more ornate. The decorations include Carrara marble statues and bas-reliefs with scenes {{from the history of}} Milan sculpted by various artists including Pompeo Marchesi and Gaetano Monti.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small surfactant molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents. It {{is important to know}} the difference between these two systems. The major difference between these two types of aggregates is in the size of their building blocks. Surfactant molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block copolymers are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block copolymers can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to surfactant molecules.|$|E
25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult time}} negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model {{does not apply}} to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements {{especially in light of the}} fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E

25|$|Other {{than their}} {{inability}} to hear music, which is most likely due to a genetic defect, the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is {{on the ability to}} tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a notable}} trend in Canadian radio {{has been the}} gradual {{abandonment}} of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that cable companies which offer cable FM services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for {{a small percentage of}} radio listeners in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe alnea and I.ochracea, {{regarded}} {{by some as}} the same species, can also be distinguished from I.saliceticola {{by the presence of}} protruding nodules on the spores. DNA analysis confirmed that they were separate from I.saliceticola, and, in any case, it is possible that they do not grow in association with willow. I.hirculus has been recorded growing near I.saliceticola, but can be differentiated both macroscopically and microscopically; the mushrooms of I.hirculus <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> [...] cap, and the stem does not join a bulb, while the spores are larger. Macroscopically, I.rivularis, which could grow in similar habitats to that of I.saliceticola, produces larger mushrooms and has powder only towards the top of the stem. It also differs microscopically.|$|E

500|$|In March 2013, Boycott and {{his partner}} Rachel Swinglehurst {{purchased}} the Grade II listed Boston Hall in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, citing {{a desire to be}} closer to family, friends, and Yorkshire County Cricket Club. They later married, and have a daughter. Later in 2014 he released a book entitled Geoffrey Boycott: The Corridor of Certainty with Simon & Schuster. ESPNcricinfo reviewed the piece in October, commenting on Boycott's more amiable personality since his recovery from cancer: [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rounded and nuanced book, full of self-awareness and a willingness, even eagerness, to acknowledge errors, failings and regrets... This a complex, driven man, whom we all recognise and admire for his achievements, revealing aspects of his life and survival that have hitherto been kept close to his chest." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{critics have}} {{described}} True Colours upon its release {{as a single}} as [...] "the most brutal thing Gallows has done." [...] Andrew Ford of Hit The Floor Magazine considered it a [...] "36 second middle finger {{to all those who}} have suggested {{this is the end of}} the road for the Watford lads." [...] Something which both critics and Wade MacNeil himself have acknowledged is his distinct tone of voice from Frank Carter even to the point in which their fan base could be divided over the decision to have Wade in the band. Wade wanted the EP and the future lyrics of Gallows records to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> global view. Believing that the band's second studio album Grey Britain had too much of a British perspective.|$|E
500|$|Telopea oreades grows {{as a large}} shrub or narrow tree [...] {{high with}} a trunk {{reaching}} [...] in diameter. Greyish brown, the trunk is thin {{in relation to the}} tree's height and not buttressed. Its surface is smooth with horizontal lenticels and warty protuberances. Smaller branches are more brown and smooth. Young plants <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> erect habit than other members of the genus Telopea and their stems have a distinct reddish tinge. The shiny dark green leaves are arranged alternately along the stems. The leaves are narrow- to , and measure [...] long and [...] wide. They have a sunken midrib on the upperside (and corresponding ridge on the underside) with four to six pairs of lateral veins visible at a 45degree angle to the midline. They veer and converge to form an easily seen vein that runs around [...] inside the leaf margin. The undersurface is paler and greyer. When dried, the leaves appear to have a granular texture.|$|E

500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Australia's {{involvement}} in the Battle of Normandy has also been commemorated through memorials and official state visits. Many of the RAAF squadrons that fought in the campaign were awarded battle honours after the war in recognition of their contribution. [...] "Normandy" [...] {{is also one of}} the 47 battle sites recorded on the Australian War Memorial, London, which was dedicated in 2003. In 2004, Australian Prime Minister John Howard attended the ceremonies in France that marked the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. The French Government also awarded the Legion of Honour to ten of the surviving Australian veterans of the landings to commemorate this anniversary. In 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and a party of seven Australian veterans of the campaign attended ceremonies held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. When the Mémorial de Caen opened in 1988, the flagpoles outside the museum commemorating the countries that participated in the battle did not include an Australian flag. Former No.453 Squadron fighter pilot Colin Leith campaigned to have an Australian flag added, and this was achieved on 1 May 1998. Despite these commemorations, there is only limited awareness among modern Australians of their country's role in the fighting in Normandy, and the campaigns fought in the Pacific <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> prominent place in the public memory of World War II.|$|E
