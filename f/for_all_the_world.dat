[...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame.

[...] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: [...] "illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay." [...] Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: [...] "America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to see." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{parents died}} {{within a few}} months of each other in 1797 and he gave up his house in Picadilly, where he had moved from Old Bond Street, to set up his studio in the family home in Greek Street. By now, {{to keep up with the}} demand for replicas of his {{portrait}}s, he was making use of studio assistants, most notable of whom would be William Etty and George Henry Harlow. The early years of the nineteenth century saw Lawrence's portrait practice continue to flourish: amongst his sitters were major political figures such as Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, whose wife Lady Caroline Lamb was also painted by Lawrence. The king commissioned portraits of his daughter-in-law Caroline, the estranged wife of the Prince of Wales, and his granddaughter Charlotte. Lawrence stayed at the Montague House, the residence of the princess in Blackheath, while he was painting the portraits and thus became implicated in the [...] "delicate investigation" [...] into Caroline's morals. He swore an affidavit that although he had on occasion been alone with the princess, the door had never been locked or bolted and he had [...] "not the least objection <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to have heard or seen what took place". Expertly defended by Spencer Perceval, he was exonerated.|$|E
2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For {{those of us who}} believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this any way I can get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue. Rather, it was {{that we were going to}} get massacred".|$|E
