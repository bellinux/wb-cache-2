25|$|Between 1955 and 1959 {{the timber}} {{deck of the}} rail level was {{replaced}} by steel, and ballasted track was substituted for the earlier waybeam track structure, adding 150 tons of <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> to each span of the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Three {{kinds of}} forces operate on any bridge: the <b>dead</b> <b>load,</b> the live load, and the dynamic load. <b>Dead</b> <b>load</b> {{refers to the}} weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a {{tendency}} to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.|$|E

25|$|A {{parabolic}} dome is {{a unique}} structure in which bending stress due to the uniformly distributed load of its <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> is zero. Hence it was widely used in buildings in ancient times, {{before the advent of}} composite structures. However, if a point load is applied on the apex of a parabolic dome, the bending stress becomes infinite. Hence it is found in most ancient structures, the apex of the dome is stiffened or the shape modified to avoid the infinite stress.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, the {{southern}} {{half of the}} structure was taking shape. However, preliminary calculations made early {{in the planning stages}} were never properly checked when the design was finalized, and the actual weight of the bridge was far in excess of its carrying capacity. The <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> was too heavy. All went well until the bridge was nearing completion in the summer of 1907, when the QBRC site engineering team under Norman McLure began noticing increasing distortions of key structural members already in place.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other <b>dead</b> <b>load,</b> live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>loads</b> {{are those}} {{representing}} the self {{weight of the}} building; their magnitude can be estimated {{on the basis of}} material densities and component sizes.|$|R

25|$|The {{additional}} constructions {{carried out}} during the subsequent Sikh and British rules of Punjab {{on the top of}} Sheesh Mahal added to the <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> that made the structure vulnerable to collapse. In 1904-05, the plaster from the ceiling of main veranda fell apart, exposing the decay of internal wooden beams and the corroding roof. At this stage, the building was listed by the department of archaeology of British India in 1927 and the repair work was carried out. Similar problems arose in 1960s and were resolved through minor repairs. In 1975, Sheesh Mahal was listed as a protected monument under the Antiquities Act by Pakistan's Department of Archaeology whereas in 1981, as part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it became inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was not until 2006 that the problems of the ceiling were comprehensively resolved and the structure was restored.|$|E
25|$|The load a {{skyscraper}} experiences {{is largely}} from {{the force of the}} building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the <b>dead</b> <b>load,</b> the load of the structure, is larger than the live load, the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The Empire State Building's setbacks are actually a result of the building code at the time (1916 Zoning Resolution), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, John Hancock Center's shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.|$|E
500|$|Remarkably, {{the support}} {{line of the}} structure's <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> is almost {{identical}} with {{the curve of the}} vault arch. The statical analysis of the bridge proves the structure's great load capacity: ...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} design an OWSJ, engineers consider the joist span between bearing points, joist spacing, slope, live <b>loads,</b> <b>dead</b> <b>loads,</b> collateral loads, seismic loads, wind uplift, deflection criteria and maximum joist depth allowed. Many steel joist manufacturers supply economical load tables {{in order to}} allow designers to select the most efficient joist sizes for their projects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>loads</b> are static {{forces that}} are {{relatively}} constant for an extended time. They can be in tension or compression. The term can refer to a laboratory test method or to the normal usage of a material or structure.|$|R
500|$|The {{design of}} the bridge differs {{slightly}} from other bridges, which are of live load composite construction. The difference is in the <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the intermediate trestle. The deck is designed with a grid structure of girders. One set of girders are {{at the end and}} another set in the middle, which are braced by girders spaced on an average at [...] centre to centre.|$|E
2500|$|Erecting the {{structure}} demanded precise calculations. The standards for cable structure construction {{required that the}} engineers create a strategy of execution, documenting each step, prior to construction. In order for {{the structure}} to be erected, much shoring and preliminary bracing was done to relieve the <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> from the gravity columns prior to cable installation. Geiger Engineers devised a plan in which the perimeter columns were erected first, after which the concrete planks and roof framing were placed, followed by the erection of the masts, and lastly the installation of each cable. The concrete planks on the roof sit on steel framing, including the large longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the roof. These girders were fabricated with W36x300s {{in the middle of}} the W27x194s at the sides. All of the wide flange shapes and masts were fabricated form ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel, while the diagonal roof bracing were A 500 Grade B. [...] Due to the precisely choreographed steel design, the Flushing Meadow Natatorium received the 2009 Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steel award. (IDEAS2). The IDEAS2 awards recognize outstanding achievements in engineering and architecture on structural steel projects around the country. The project was judged on structural steel innovation, with an emphasis on creative solutions to project requirements. The form was directly derived from the structural requirements of the program.|$|E

50|$|Buildings will {{be subject}} to loads from various sources. The {{principal}} ones can be classified as live loads (loads which are not always present in the structure), <b>dead</b> <b>loads</b> (loads which are permanent and immovable excepting redesign or renovation) and wind load, as described below. In some cases structures may be subject to other loads, such as those due to earthquakes or pressures from retained material. The expected maximum magnitude of each {{is referred to as the}} characteristic load.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Utilizing general {{finite element}} {{software}} ANSYS, the finite element computing {{model of the}} steel spatial tubular joint is built, {{which is used to}} analyze the mechanical properties under <b>dead</b> <b>loads</b> through changing its design parameters. According to the obtained and compared consequences, the different design parameters including stiffening ring thickness, cross-shaped ribbed plate thickness and stiffening ring length exert different influence on ultimate bearing capacity of the steel spatial tubular joint. Specifically, the ultimate bearing capacity under <b>dead</b> <b>loads</b> is affected by setting stiffening ring and changing cross-shaped ribbed plate thickness significantly. In contrast, if the thickness and length of stiffening ring are changed, the impact is insignificant. The results and conclusion can provide reference which is useful to optimize the design of steel spatial tubular joint in such category...|$|R

50|$|A {{curtain wall}} system is an outer {{covering}} {{of a building}} in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep the weather out and the occupants in. As the curtain wall is non-structural {{it can be made}} of a lightweight material, reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall faÃ§ade does not carry any <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> weight from the building other than its own <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> weight. The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and seismic forces acting on the building, and its own <b>dead</b> <b>load</b> weight forces.|$|E

Historically, pre-engineered building manufacturers have developed pre-calculated tables for different structural elements {{in order to allow}} designers to select the most efficient I beams size for their projects. However, the table selection procedures are becoming rare with the evolution in computer-aided custom designs.|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in the human {{expansion}} into space consists of the construction of a human-tended base on the Moon. Establishment of a lunar base depends upon the development of a structure capable of accomodating human life and activities in a shirt sleeve environment. Design and construction of a structure on the Moon require addressing a host of issues and loads that are not encountered on Earth. A lunar structure is essentially a pressure vessel since the internal pressure is the dominating load. The external pressure is effectively an absolute vacuum and the <b>dead</b> <b>loads</b> from both the material mass and a protective regolith layer are quite small due to low lunar gravity. An inflatable structure made of a thin membrane integrated with an inflated supporting frame is highly efficient in resisting the internal pressure <b>loading</b> and the <b>dead</b> <b>loads.</b> Preliminary design computations for a generic lunar inflatable structure are presented...|$|R
