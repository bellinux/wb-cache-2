A novel attacker localization mechanism, called Access Point Coordinated Localization (APCL), is proposed for IEEE 802. 11 networks. APCL ac-tively forces the attacker to reveal its position information by combining access point (AP) coordination with the tradi-tional range-free localization. The optimal AP coordination process is calculated by modeling it as a finite horizon dis-crete Markov decision process, which is efficiently solved by an approximation algorithm. The performance advantages are verified through extensive simulations...|$|R

50|$|Scott resumes {{his search}} for {{the author of the}} script in order to confirm the date of submission, thereby proving his client’s case that Creel had <b>intentionally</b> <b>hidden</b> it from his partner. Scott discovers that the real author died before the script was produced, yet an “author” {{continues}} to receive royalty checks, addressed to Willard Thorne, a fabricated name. Scott begins to suspect that Creel, impersonating the author, was receiving royalty checks as well as revenues from the produced play. Gladys, Creel’s former secretary who tells Scott the true identity of the author, is found strangled the day after he speaks with her, and Scott begins to fear for his own life. Scott and Lieutenant John Nola, a police detective, although unable to find a solid link between Creel and the murders acknowledge that the circumstances seem to indicate his guilt, and they decide to question him, hoping to back him into a corner. When they arrive, they find Creel dead, stabbed with a knife belonging to Hildegard; Hildegard said that the knife had been stolen the night before. The knife was an heirloom passed down to Hildegard from her uncle Julian. Scott notices that the hilt opens, revealing a hollow tube and remembers a photograph found in Creel’s apartment curled like a scroll to a roll the width of a pencil. The image is a wedding photograph of Julian and Eva St George, and Scott notices that the photo shows Julian to be definitely shorter than Eva, whereas the Julian he knows is very tall. Julian St George was receiving substantial annuity payments every month, and since his father had set up the policy for him long before he was married, upon Julian's death, the policy would be terminated, and his wife Eva would no longer receive anything. Scott, upon seeing the height discrepancy, realizes that the real Julian St George had died years ago, but to continue receiving the annuity, Eva had gotten an impersonator, someone who looked exactly like Julian except for the unfortunate difference in height. Creel had discovered the photograph concealed in his wife’s knife heirloom and was blackmailing the St Georges, extorting thousands of dollars and forcing them to receive checks as Willard Thorne in order to give him the money once the checks were cashed. In an effort to destroy the one piece of evidence remaining of the former Julian St George, the impersonator had stolen the knife. Wanting to remove the remaining witness to their scheme, he had killed Nicholas Creel. When Scott confronts the St Georges with his theory, the impersonator draws a gun, planning to kill Scott as well. Lieutenant Nola enters just in time to save Scott, starting a gunfight in which the impersonator is shot and killed.|$|E

As a result, achieving satisfactory application performance demands an adaptation of the respective parallel algorithm to such systems. This, in turn, requires knowledge about the actual hardware structure even at the application level. However, the prevalent Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (at least in its current version 2. 1) <b>intentionally</b> <b>hides</b> heterogeneity from the application programmer in order to assure portability. In this paper, we introduce the MPIXternal library which tries to circumvent this obvious semantic gap within the current MPI standard. For this purpose, the library offers the programmer additional features that should help to adapt applications to today’s hierarchical systems in a convenient and portable way. 1...|$|R
