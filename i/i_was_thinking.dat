25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while.

I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E

In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my head and I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing.

500|$|Shearsmith {{identified}} [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] {{as one of}} his two favourite {{episodes of}} the series, along with [...] "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords.

It began as a '{{before and after}}' record, but it's become an 'after' record". The ballad [...] "I'd Do It All Again" [...] was written by Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: [...] "When I started writing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked…' But I had to".

[...] R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, [...] "I love a good science fiction story; just tell me in advance." [...] He gave the film a B-. Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was [...] "'Well, holy shit.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'" ...|$|E

Merengue is a type of music and dance originating in the Dominican Republic, and after being referred to Bello by Pitbull, Shakira travelled to the country and began recording sessions with him in his [...] "tiny" [...] studio in Santo Domingo. Bello talked about his collaboration with Shakira, saying [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> that this little studio was going to be in the world’s vision at this time, I wouldn't believe it".|$|E

When Da'Rel Scott was eight years old, his parents had a falling out, which prompted his father to leave the family. Thereafter, Lee Scott, Sr. was no longer involved in raising his sons and would often miss scheduled visits. Da'Rel Scott said, [...] "He just kept letting me down.

Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b> Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories.

Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, {{she told me she}} had never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At the end of the performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E

Gilligan stated that he named the episode [...] "Box Cutter" [...] mainly because [...] "it just sounded like a cool title", but also because he was concerned that {{the climax of the}} episode took so long to build to that, by calling it [...] "Box Cutter", [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> on some level, 'We'd better let the audience know that there's something at the end of this.'" [...] Although the Breaking Bad staff always intended for Gale to be killed, the audience reaction to [...] "Full Measure" [...] made Gilligan and the Breaking Bad writing staff reconsider whether their plans were the best ones. However, Gilligan said they instead decided to follow their original plan, saying [...] "At the end of the day, the choice we made for how to press forward was the choice we felt was the most honest, and the one that would best continue the story." ...|$|E
