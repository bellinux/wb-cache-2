50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the enrollees {{in the first year}} high school for the next school year, an additional classroom was built. Through the efforts of Fr. Leon Hugo, Sor Cristina and Sor Joaquina, the La Consolacion Academy Parents-Teachers Association known as LACAPTA was organized. This association launched a fund-raising campaign and made possible the construction of the building.Meantime, gradually the school’s population increased and by 1954, La Consolacion Academy turned out its first batch of exclusive female high school graduates. Since then, with Sor Esperanza Molina, OSA, Sor Consolacion Alvarez, OSA and Sor Adelina Segismundo, OSA, as the respective Schoolheads, the school year’s 1954-1955 to the early 60’s were devoted to the improvement of the school’s physical structures and the acquisition of the basic school facilities and needs. These years also witnessed the active participation of the school in the prestigious Bicol Association of Catholic Schools (BACS) Meet and in holding grandiose annual plays.Sor Victorina de la Providencia’s term witnessed the beginning of the WAS and the majorettes. 1966-1967 and the immediate years that followed featured the victory of the Scouting Movement and the Drum and Bugle Corps in regional competitions. Furthermore, to answer the immediate needs of Iriga for a private sectarian school for boys, La Consolacion Academy opened its doors for a co-educational setting in high school in the school year 1970-1971.La Consolacion Academy celebrated its Silver Jubilee in the school year 1973-1974. With Sister Esperanza Magana, OSA as Schoolhead, again the school launched a fund-raising drive through the Mr. and Ms. Silver Jubilee.School year 1974-1975 featured the start of new programs such as the LCA Credit Cooperatives, the Guidance Program and the Christian Neighborhood Communities. With Sister Constancia Benares, OSA as the Schoolhead, the school carved its name in the division and regional competitions on academics and literary-musical activities where both the public and the private schools merged under the new MECS structure. The years that followed under Sister Consolata Dalisay, OSA and Sister Florina Lacuarta, OSA witnessed the continuance of the new programs.It was in the school year 1979-1980 with Sister Adelina Segismundo, OSA as Schoolhead when the Parents’ Homeroom Organization began.With Sister Ma. Celia Bayona, OSA as Schoolhead, 1981-1982 featured the start of the Catholic School Systems Development Program or the CS-SD with Mr. Feliciano Jimenez as Consultant. Aside from the development of persons and structures, the new program’s main contribution was the decentralization of authority in school where for the first time lay administrators were appointed to the school’s varied offices.In answer to the ever-growing population and through a loan, a new concrete building was constructed just behind the templete in the school year 1983-1984. The school likewise experienced its first external evaluation via the Congregational <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Visit</b> or CEV in February 1984. Given the signal to apply for external accreditation, La Consolacion Academy underwent a Pre-Survey by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) in the grade school and high school departments in March, 1987.Sister Ana Isabel Marcelo, OSA acted as the Principal in school year 1987-1988. With Sister Editha Zerna, OSA as Schoolhead in 1988-1989, the school celebrated its Ruby Anniversary. Massive fund-raising drives were held to support the school’s on-going construction plan. Alongside this growth in physical structures was the school’s academic growth. In April, 1991 the Grade School was granted its initial accreditation status by PAASCU while the High School followed suit in April, 1992. With both the grade school and the high school fully accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), the school ventured on the opening of collegiate courses. In response to the city’s need for a private sectarian college, the following initial courses were offered in school year 1992-1993: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education, Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education, two-year courses in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Tourism and Computer Technology. Thus, in September, 1992 from La Consolacion Academy, the school has become La Consolacion College. In school year 1994-1995, Sister Esperanza Magana, OSA became President and Schoolhead. Answering the call for lay empowerment, the first Lay Principal for the Basic Education Department - Dr. Gloria C. Pasco was appointed in the same school year. The school’s option for the poor was made more concrete {{with the opening of the}} Free High School for the indigents. Meantime, alongside the school’s on-going construction were the PAASCU re-accreditation surveys. The Grade School was Re-Surveyed in January, 1995 and was granted a five-year PAASCU re-accreditation status. The High School had its Re-Survey in October, 1996 and was likewise given a five-year PAASCU re-accreditation status. The school had its first college graduates in March, 1995. In preparation for the school’s Golden Jubilee in 1999, La Consolacion College undertook some projects as the school’s gift to the community on its fiftieth (50th) year. It offered free pilinut seedlings for planting. It conducted tree-planting activities at Maryhill Settlement in San Pedro, Iriga City. It adopted a new barangay - San Vicente Sur, Iriga City for its outreach program and a cooperative was formed in San Vicente Nabua, Camarines Sur. Moreover, free medical missions were conducted and in April, 1997 a Free Summer Nursery class began.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to provide a descriptive and critical analysis of the function of evaluation teams in regional accreditation of senior colleges and universities [...] how evaluators perceive their roles, how they spend their time on site, and how they make decisions. The objectives of the study were (1) {{to determine the extent to}} which regional accrediting visits do what they are purported to do in regional policy and procedure statements, and (2) to determine the strengths and weaknesses in the onsite evaluation process as perceived by regional evaluation team members. The methodology involved a three-step process: (1) a content analysis of regional policy statements regarding the <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit,</b> (2) a survey of evaluators from five of the six regional associations, and (3) a review and comment on the draft findings by professional staff of the participating regional commissions. An overall response rate of 82 percent was obtained from the sample of 349 evaluators [...] without the use of follow-up mailings. Regional cross tabulations of evaluator responses, together with Chi-square statistics and standard errors of the percentages, provided the basis for the analysis. Major conclusions of the study were: (1) The lack of clear specification of the purpose of the evaluation team visit rendered it difficult to determine whether the purported purposes of the visit were being met. (2) The major strengths of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit</b> lay in the expertise and dedication of the volunteer evaluators, and in the willingness of the commissions to adapt their procedures to changing needs and new technologies. The major weakness in the <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit</b> was the lack of an evaluation framework or model to guide the work of the evaluation team. The researcher's recommendations included (1) the regional commissions should clearly specify the intended purposes of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit</b> in light of the overall purposes of regional accreditation, and (2) the regional commissions should utilize a coordinating group such as the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation and the evaluation expertise within academe to develop a framework, or genre, to guide team members in accomplishing the purposes of the visit...|$|E

In these cases, correction of implant-associated facial volume loss may be achieved by using injectable poly-L-lactic acid. Injectable poly-L-lactic acid has been used successfully and safely for restoration and/or correction of the signs of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy) in people with human immunodeficiency virus. Here, the author reports the off-label use of injectable poly-L-lactic acid for the correction of facial volume loss following removal of malar cheek implants to yield a cheek lift and correction of prominent nasolabial fold wrinkles in a man with no significant medical problems. A total of three treatments using two vials of injectable poly-L-lactic acid per treatment were administered over the course of 16 weeks. Photographs were taken at baseline, during the 16 -week injection period, and at a post-treatment <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit</b> 35 days after the final treatment (21 weeks after the initial injection). Although the patient has since been lost to follow up, he was very satisfied with the aesthetic results at the <b>evaluation</b> <b>visit</b> five weeks after the last treatment and expressed a desire to be treated with poly-L-lactic acid in the future. Injectable poly-L-lactic acid may be a good option for the correction of facial volume loss due to reasons other than human immunodeficiency virus-related lipoatrophy...|$|E
