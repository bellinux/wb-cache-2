25|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{are commonly used}} in business valuation: the <b>income</b> <b>approach,</b> the asset-based approach, and the market approach. Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining {{the value of a}} business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the <b>income</b> <b>approach</b> with the market approach.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>income</b> <b>approach</b> relies {{upon the}} {{economic}} principle of expectation: {{the value of}} business {{is based on the}} expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine fair market value by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into present value. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or cash flows, discounted future cash flows ("DCF"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the <b>income</b> <b>approach</b> is generally the fair market value of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies. [...] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is similar}} to using the market {{approach}} in the <b>income</b> <b>approach</b> instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach. [...] The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) {{is a relatively new}} concept. [...] It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory. [...] Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} speed of convergence [...] {{the rate at which}} a country's per capita <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> its steady state relative to its distance from its steady state [...] have started from the assumption that it is constant. In contrast, neoclassical models of capital accumulation usually predict that the speed of convergence decreases as <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> its steady state. Estimating a flexible functional form which allows the speed of convergence to vary suggests that the speed of convergence actually increases as <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> its steady state. An increasing speed of convergence calls into question structural interpretations of coefficients on conditioning variables in cross-sectional growth regressions. Instead, excluding initial income from cross-sectional growth regressions allows coefficients on exogenous variables to be interpreted as measuring changes in underlying structural relationships. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I discuss {{the pros and}} cons of using net income vs. gross income in gross income-shares states. It is argued that the “standardized net ” {{approach}} is the best approach in determining child support awards based on the combined principles of equity and accuracy. However most states use gross <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> for the sake of simplicity. Such gross <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> can generate biases in support awards. Using 2004 tax structures and taking into consideration Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit, I estimate the direction, magnitude, and distribution of such biases under three different scenarios of “gross <b>income</b> ” <b>approaches.</b> Results show that these biases can be either positive or negative depending on the particular assumptions made in the gross-to-net income conversion process. In some income combination cases, the biases can be quite substantial. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{narrative}} appraisal report {{is to determine the}} market value of a single-family, one story residence, based on the principles espoused by the National Association of Independent Free Appraisers (N. A. I. F. A.). Three approaches will be utilized to determine the market value of this residence. The comparable sales, cost and <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> are the viable alternatives in determining the fair value of a residence in the market place. All three of these approaches will be included in the value analysis of this property. These three approaches should provide a more accurate determination of value than the typical real estate agent's "windshield appraisal". Nevertheless, some subjective opinions of the appraiser must be inserted into the report; however, the final determination of value will be based on the outcomes of these three approaches. The value of propertymay best be described as the present worth of future benefits resulting from the ownership of the property. Value, which is constantly changing, is dependent on time, use and demand. For this reason the comparable sales, cost and <b>income</b> <b>approaches</b> are used to provide a check and balance indication of value. 1.) The value to replace or reproduce a building less the loss in value caused by deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence, plus the value of the land. 2.) The value by comparison to the selling prices similar to properties in comparable areas with adjustments for time, location, and conditions of sale. 3.) The value in comparison to the economic rental of similar properties. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
