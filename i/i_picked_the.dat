500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E
500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} {{anything out of the}} game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland had a chance to win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team and <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> team and sorted the tactics so I have no problem taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stoner {{suffered}} a broken right scapula and a fractured left tibia {{as a result}} of the accident. Stoner commented on the crash, [...] "I didn't have enough time to engage the clutch [...] <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> bike up to try to slow down but I was heading towards the wall so I decided to lay it over and hit the barrier. Unfortunately the barriers were a lot harder than they looked and we came out of it with broken bones." [...] Honda investigated the bike and discovered that the throttle mechanism had been defective and was stuck open at 26 degrees before the crash. Honda officially apologised to Stoner for the mechanical failure.|$|E

6000|$|... 'For God's sake do {{not treat}} it so unkindly,' I cried, {{springing}} down from my horse and laying my hand upon my companion's arm.

60|$|When {{we entered}} the narrow strait, under full sail and gripped by a {{tremendous}} tide, the rugged headlands of Tierra del Fuego dashed by with dizzying swiftness. Close we were to them, and close we were to the jagged coast of Staten Island on the opposite shore. It was here, in a wild bight, between two black and precipitous walls of rock where even the snow could find no lodgment, that Captain West paused in a casual sweep of his glasses and gazed steadily at one place. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> spot up with my own glasses and was aware of an instant chill as I saw the four masts of a great ship {{sticking out of the}} water. Whatever craft it was, it was as large as the Elsinore, and it had been but recently wrecked.|$|E

There was others wanted me besides him. Bless you, I had my pick. Why not? When you have a trifle of money left you that you didn't expect, if that don't make a lady of you, what does? Isn't a lady to have her pick? I had my trifle of money, and I had my pick, and <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> captain--I did. He was the smartest and the shortest of them all. He took care of me and my money. I'm here, the money's gone. Don't you put that towel down on the table--he won't have that! Don't move his razors--don't, please, or I shall forget which is which. I've got to remember which is which to-morrow morning. Bless you, the captain don't shave himself! He had me taught. I shave him. I do his hair, and cut his nails--he's awfully particular about his nails. So he is about his trousers. And his shoes. And his newspaper in the morning. And his breakfasts, and lunches, and dinners, and teas--" [...] She stopped, struck by a sudden recollection, looked about her, observed the tattered old book on the floor, and clasped her hands in despair. [...] "I've lost the place!" [...] she exclaimed helplessly. [...] "Oh, mercy, what will become of me! I've lost the place." ...|$|E

I niver could find in me heart to consociate wid them consaited commissioners--though there was wan or two of 'em as was desarvin' o' the three stripes. But I niver took kindly to sodgerin'. It was in the Howth militia I was. Good enough boys they was in their way, but I couldn't pull wid them no how. They made me a corp'ral for good conduct, but, faix, the great review {{finished}} me; for I got into that state of warlike feeling that I loaded me muskit five times widout firin', an' {{there was such a}} row round about that I didn't know the dirty thing had niver wint off till the fifth time, when she bursted into smithereens an' wint off intirely. No wan iver seed a scrag of her after that. An' the worst was, she carried away the small finger of Bob Riley's left hand. Bob threw down his muskit an' ran off the ground howlin', so <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> wipon up an' blazed away at the inimy; but, bad luck to him, Bob had left his ramrod in, and I sint it right through the flank of an owld donkey as was pullin' an apple and orange cart.

6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} it," [...] said Dupin. [...] "I am not sure of it. Here, however, is {{a small piece of}} ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is {{peculiar}} to the Maltese. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> ribbon up {{at the foot of the}} lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement--about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus:--'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value--to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself--why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne--at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault--they have failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.'" ...|$|E
