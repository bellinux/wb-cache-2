40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the ecology of moulds and their toxic {{potential}} during the pre-ripening or ripening of San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham.</b> Three different facilities and their products were investigated. These facilities were chosen {{on the basis of}} their production capacity: one for industrial production, one for semi-industrial production and one for handicraft production. The mould microflora was predominantly represented by 2 genera, which were found either on the surface of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> or in the air of the production rooms. The identified species were quite similar among the three facilities. Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. were the main genera isolated during the duration of pre-ripening and ripening. The toxic potential of the isolated strains and the presence of Ochratoxin A (OTA) on the surface of or in San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> were also investigated. No OTA was found either on the surface (mould slime) or in the meat of the investigated hams. Moreover, no OTA-producing moulds, with the exception of Aspergillus niger, were isolated. However, different yeast and mould strains were tested for the ability to inhibit the growth of OTA producing moulds. Penicillium nalgiovense, Candida guilliermondii and Endomycopsis fibuliger prevented the growth of co-inoculated OTA producing moulds, and no OTA was detected on the surface of the <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham.</b> Thus, it appears that San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> does not represent a health hazar...|$|E

40|$|Ochratoxin A and L. monocytogenes in San Daniele dry cured ham: occurrence, {{reduction}} and prevention. The fungal {{population of the}} plants and of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> of San Daniele is varied and complex. However, {{it does not seem}} to be formed from species producing ochratoxin A (OTA), in contrast to that observed by other authors. Nevertheless we wanted to evaluate "in vitro" for the production of OTA in all species of Aspergillus and Penicillium, isolated from ripening rooms and <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham.</b> None has shown the ability to synthesize OTA. Consequently, based on what is observed it can exclude the presence of this mycotoxin on surfaces or in the meat of San Daniele ham. Furthermore, the use of a starter consisting in Penicillium nalgiovense, Candida guilliermondii or Saccharomycopsis fibuliger, prevents the development of micotossigenic mold in ham during the pre-curing and aging. The antilisterial activity of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) bacteriophage Listex P 100 (phage P 100) is demonstrated in broths and on the surface of slice of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> and pork skin against 19 strains or serotypes (i. e. 2 a, 1 / 2 a, 4 b) of Listeria monocytogenes. In a broth model system, phage P 100 completely inhibited either 2 log CFU/cm 2 or 3 log CFU/cm 2 of L. monocytogenes growth at 30 °C at phage concentrations equal or upper than 7 log PFU/ml. The temperature (4, 10, 20 °C) seemed not to influence the phages activity, nevertheless at 4 °C it was possible obtained the best results. On <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham</b> slices, a phage concentration from 5 to 8 log PFU/cm 2 was required to obtain significant L. monocytogenres reduction. In particular at 4 °C an inocolum of 8 PFU was required to eliminate completely a concentration of 2 log L. monocytogenes/cm 2 and to reach 0 tolerance according USA food law. At 10 and 20 °C the reductions were less significatives and yielded 3. 0 and 2. 4 log CFU/cm 2.

Mites are very small (1 / 2 mm long), feed on the surface of dry cured meat and follow the seam fat to the interior of the bone and interior of the hams. Mites cannot fly, but they can crawl around extensively and may be carried from one spot to another by humans and other insects.

A higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in respect to the non-smoked product was also observed. This latter result, associated to a lower acidity index and peroxide value, {{could be attributed to}} the antioxidant properties of some smoke compounds. Smoking affected also the textural properties of the <b>cured</b> <b>hams</b> (i. e. hardness and elasticity) whilst no effect was observed on the colour. Limited differences were evidenced in the microbial quality of the differently treated hams apart from a significantly higher mesophylic count in the non-smoked ones. In the smoked products a higher concentration of biogenic amines and in particular of triptamine, 2 -pheniletilamine and spermine was also observed. However, in all cases, the concentration of 2 -pheniletilamine resulted below the toxicity limit (30 mg kg- 1). [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{name of the}} Bachelor's {{thesis is}} the Technology of {{production}} and quality evaluation of hams, and it focuses primarily on cooked hams. Nevertheless, other types are characterized and described, too, especially the <b>dried</b> <b>cured</b> <b>ham,</b> which is popular abroad. All issues connected to the product are included, from its classification with the meat products, definition, ingredients, and technology of production, to the evaluation of its quality using laboratory methods. The Prague ham is now the most famous Czech ham, typical for its ingredients and technology of production. Nowadays, some attempts develop {{to put it on}} the list of guaranteed traditional specialities. The source rump plays the most important role in the production of soft smoked ham, while its quality is influenced not only by the feedstuff of the livestock, but also by manufacturing of meat itself. Moreover, the appropriate ratio of additives plays a significant role, together with the proper storage in the right temperatures. These aspects then affect the resulting quality of the product, which is checked by sensory analysis and laboratory methods...|$|R
