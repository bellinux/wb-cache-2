5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of <b>deforestation</b> of prime timberland; to avoid excessive <b>deforestation,</b> the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|Large {{parts of}} Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with {{abundant}} wildlife. <b>Deforestation</b> and poaching {{has reduced the}} amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and <b>deforestation,</b> due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.|$|E
5|$|Tourism was an {{important}} industry for the country, but has been failing in recent years. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and <b>deforestation.</b> The report warns {{that the loss of}} life combined with widespread <b>deforestation</b> is potentially disastrous for the tourist industry.|$|E
5|$|As for fruit trees, mangos {{and oranges}} {{are the most}} populous. Prickly pears, flamboyants, and {{colourful}} bougainvilleas brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations {{have contributed to the}} <b>deforestation</b> of the island.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} has generally benefited the American goldfinch. It is {{often found in}} residential areas, attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas. <b>Deforestation</b> also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Nigeria had {{the highest}} rate of <b>deforestation</b> in the world, {{according}} to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In 2005 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual <b>deforestation</b> rate of 2.38%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its forest cover, or around 6,145,000 hectares.|$|E
5|$|In both Myanmar and Thailand, <b>deforestation</b> {{and other}} {{economic}} factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves {{as well as economic}} and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.|$|E
5|$|Many {{localized}} {{areas are}} subject to human-made pollution {{of the air and}} water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, <b>deforestation,</b> desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Pushkar Lake and its precincts {{has become increasingly}} degraded {{in the last few}} decades. The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the <b>deforestation</b> of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of <b>deforestation</b> there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant <b>deforestation</b> witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming a leader in the voluntary Forest Stewardship Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid <b>deforestation</b> for agriculture and illegal logging.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans, an {{estimated}} 80% of the land was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive <b>deforestation</b> occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared {{to make room for}} pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E
5|$|Extensive <b>deforestation</b> has {{resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the main}} reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 migratory species were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat has been largely lost to agriculture, and forest species, as <b>deforestation</b> for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Ucu {{collaborated with}} Dinata again on Batik: Our Love Story, a {{documentary}} on the traditional textile batik. Dinata directed, while Ucu served as screenwriter. , Ucu is working on three documentaries: Knocking The Door, about the Indonesian Bill for Public Information; Thank You for Loving Me, about <b>deforestation</b> in Indonesia; and Where Did You Go My Love, about kidnap victims.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused <b>deforestation,</b> causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{are raised}} {{throughout}} the country. Fishing employs 5,000 people and provides over 100,000 tons of seafood each year. Bushmeat, long a staple food for rural Cameroonians, is today a delicacy in the country's urban centres. The commercial bushmeat trade has now surpassed <b>deforestation</b> {{as the main}} threat to wildlife in Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of <b>deforestation,</b> the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. <b>Deforestation</b> is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal use in Indonesia {{was also}} {{recorded}} in the 1930s, and was more recently reported in modern-day Ghana. A report for the 2005 Commonwealth Forestry Conference examining the possible effects of <b>deforestation</b> in southern Ghana on medicinal and edible fungi found that A.auricula-judae was in use as a blood tonic.|$|E
5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but <b>deforestation</b> in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} they were said to damage crops {{probably}} contributed to them being hunted. The French settlers began to clear forests using the slash-and-burn technique for <b>deforestation</b> in the 1730s, which in itself would have had a large effect on the parrot population and on the other animals that nest in tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{consumed}} up to 1000cords {{of firewood}} every {{year during the}} 180-day navigation period, a quantity so great that it led to <b>deforestation</b> {{of most of the}} Kõpu peninsula. A team of six was on guard every night, but storms extinguished the fire often. A rule passed in 1652 decreed that the fire must be strong and a fathom (~) high.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{threats to}} red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, {{competition}} with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and <b>deforestation</b> resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The {{relative importance of}} these factors is different in each region, and is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and <b>deforestation.</b> As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
5|$|Tourism and <b>deforestation</b> in the {{surroundings}} {{have taken a}} heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as <b>deforestation</b> and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered <b>deforestation,</b> erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of insensitive tourist development and <b>deforestation</b> on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and <b>deforestation</b> may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face <b>deforestation</b> due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deforestation</b> {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{blackbuck}} numbers declined sharply due {{to excessive}} hunting, <b>deforestation</b> and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially {{where they are}} sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by <b>deforestation,</b> over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and <b>deforestation,</b> and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, <b>deforestation</b> and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{he founded}} {{a mission to}} work with the Asháninka due to <b>deforestation</b> caused by settlers. He {{maintained}} the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E
