The {{effect of}} enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>bag</b> {{composition}} and freezing and thawing upon {{the stability of}} riboflavin and vitamins A and E in an enteral feeding solution was tested. Feeding bags composed of either polyvinyl chloride or polyeth-ylene were filled with an enteral feeding solution.

Samples for vitamin analysis were obtained prior to freezing, upon thawing, and at 12 hr after thawing. No significant differences in vitamin stability due to bag composition or time were seen. These results support {{the viability of the}} concept of mixing large batches of enteral feeding solution, and freezing aliquots in individual feeding bags for later use.

40|$|SUMMARY Enteral feeding {{solutions}} can {{be contaminated}} by bacterial micro-organisms already {{present in the}} ingredients, or introduced during preparation or transport, or in the hospital ward. During jejunostomy feeding without pump or filter, ascending bacterial invasion of the <b>feeding</b> <b>bag</b> is possible. In patients with lowered immune response contaminated feedings can cause serious septic clinical problems. The progressive loss of the nutritional value of the enteral feeding solution by bacterial contamination has {{to be considered for}} all patients. One of the best known and clinically important complications of parenteral nutrition is catheter related sepsis. This is usually caused by exogenous bacterial contamination of the feeding system. ' As a consequence, we have learnt of the importance of using strictly aseptic techniques during preparation and administration of parenteral nutrition solutions. Most enteral feeding solutions also represent an ideal growth medium for bacterial micro-organisms. Various bacteria have now been isolated and cul-tured from enteral diets.

40|$|Using Low Fidelity Human Simulation to Develop Clinical Reasoning Skills in DPT Students in the Intensive Care Unit Lynda Ross, PT, DPT, DHS Introduction Managing {{patients}} {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) requires fast, accurate clinical decisions while monitoring physiological responses to movement. Simulation, an active instructional tool, replicates the ICU environment so students can practice these skills without risk to actual patients. Post-simulation debriefing reveals students’ frames of reference that drive their underlying clinical decisions and actions adding the critical element of reflective practice. Purpose To describe a simulation experience used to cultivate doctor of physical therapy students’ clinical reasoning skills in managing complex {{patients in}} the ICU. Description of Innovation DPT students performed a supine to sit transfer on a simulated mechanically ventilated patient in the ICU. A low fidelity mannequin was connected to the ventilator, multiple intravenous therapy bags, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy <b>feeding</b> <b>bag,</b> and Foley catheter. A simulated patient monitor application was used to display and control the patient’s blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO 2, and respiration rate. Post-simulation debriefing was performed. Students wrote a reflection and action plan paper after the experience. Outcomes Several themes emerged from students’ reflections: 1) overall students were satisfied with performance, 2) communication with team members needed improvement, and 3) coursework prior to simulation enhanced success. Discussion Simulation is an active learning strategy in combination with coursework that prepares DPT students for highly complex patient care.

40|$|The {{closed system}} of enteral feeding {{involves}} the use of a sterile feeding container that is spiked with a feeding set. Formula is infused to the patient without further manipulation of the system. Closed systems were preceded by open systems that are administered via the decanting of canned liquids or reconstituted powders into empty plastic feeding containers. These containers are reopened periodi-cally to add more formula. Closed-system feedings may be another way to improve efficiencies and patient outcomes via nutrition practice. Enteral Feeding Contamination Enteral feeding solutions support the growth {{of a wide variety of}} microorganisms, creating an under-appreciated risk factor for many patients. The microorganisms in contaminated feeding containers are those commonly isolated from the hospital or home environment. Food contamination is defined in Table 1, based on the 1995 Food and Drug Admin-istration guidelines for medical foods. ' Formulas become contaminated with microorgan-isms due to faulty handling during mixing, trans-port to the patient floor, transfer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>bag,</b> storage, or administration. Water used to dilute or reconstitute formula may also contain significant amounts of gram negative organisms such as Esch-erichia coli, Pseiidomonas, and Enterobacter. Most open-system feeding containers are filled with enough formula to hang for 4 to 12 hours and are refilled with formula as needed. Some facilities man-date the rinsing of formula containers before refill-ing. Rinsing has not been found to be effective for eliminating bacteria: allowing for a continuous cul-ture to reside in the feeding reservoir. The use of food blenders and the addition of nutrient modules and food coloring to formulas have also been impli-cated in enteral feeding c ~ n t a m i n a t i o n. ~-...|$|E

40|$|Background: Dairy farming work {{involves}} {{frequent use}} of poor postures. These postures may {{increase the risk of}} developing musculoskeletal disorders among dairy workers. Objective: To assess postural load during performance of various tasks related to dairy farming. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a dairy farm in Iran. In order to assess postural load, tasks related to dairy farming were divided into 3 categories: feeding, milking, and manure disposal. Each task was then divided into its constituent work subdivisions (tasks). Finally, the working posture for each work subdivision was evaluated using Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). Results: Based on the results from the REBA score, the poorest risk scores (risk level 4) were associated with the following tasks: (1) manure disposal, (2) filling <b>feed</b> <b>bags,</b> and (3) pouring milk into a bucket. Other tasks such as filling corn containers, pouring corn into the milling machine, preparing the feed, pouring food into mangers, attaching the milking machine, and pouring milk from a bucket into a tank imposed high risk (risk level 3).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the post-ruminal effects of feeding ruminants different concentrations of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) in low crude protein diets using the long-term rumen simulation method (Rusitec) followed by in vitro abomasum and ileum digestibility technique. The experiment contained four treatment groups: (1) high protein, without RPM supplementation (HP); (2) low protein, without RPM supplementation (LP); (3) low protein supplementation with low RPM (LPLM); and (4) low protein supplementation with high RPM (LPHM) mixed per 20  ± 0.04 g basal diet in every fermenter. The results showed that the LPLM and LPHM groups had significantly higher disappearance of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the abomasum and ileum than the HP treatment (P[*]<[*] 0.05) and were the same as the LP group (P[*]>[*] 0.05). The proportions of short-chain fatty acids and total volatile fatty acids in the abomasum and ileum were the same between the LPHM and HP groups (P[*]>[*] 0.05); however, the LPLM group was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the HP group and similar to the LP group (P[*]>[*] 0.05). Rusitec pH before or after changing <b>feed</b> <b>bags</b> and daily ammonia nitrogen production in the abomasum and ileum were non significantly (P > 0.05) different among all groups. In conclusion, RPM supplementation with low crude protein diets promoted post-ruminal digestibility and production of volatile fatty acids.|$|R

Auchiah first studied art at St. Patrick's Indian Mission School in Anadarko, Oklahoma, under Sister Olivia Taylor, a Choctaw nun. His love for art was such that in elementary school, he was caught painting in class. As punishment, the teacher made him finish his painting instead of eating dinner. The young Auchiah said in response that was fine with him, [...] "I would rather paint than eat."The skills of several young Kiowa living near Anadarko, Oklahoma had caught the eye of a government field matron, Susan Peters, in 1920.

Recognizing the talent of some of the young artists, Peters convinced Swedish-American artist, Oscar Jacobson, director of the University of Oklahoma's School of Art, to accept the Kiowa students into a special program at the school.They were coached and encouraged by Edith Mahier.|$|R
