5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another.

5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design.

5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E

5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Later in the decade, Millwall {{established}} {{a record of}} 59 home games without defeat (43 wins and 16 <b>draws)</b> <b>from</b> 22 August 1964 to 14 January 1967. During this spell, Millwall played 55 different teams, kept 35 clean sheets, scored 112 goals and conceded 33. This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the foundations, and Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray's side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association. The record was eventually broken by Liverpool, who were unbeaten for 63 games at home between 1978 and 1981.|$|E
5|$|Musically, Animal <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> the electropop genre, while {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} dance-pop in its production and beats.

Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on Canadian Albums Chart, US Billboard 200 and IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. Animal was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies to the United States and has sold over two million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{survival}} horror game {{can be traced back}} to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Cthulhoid Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.|$|E

5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the Manchester City job, but the offer was {{withdrawn}} after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Ironically Newcastle then also {{had a change of}} owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £13million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (£6million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (£5.5million), left-back José Enrique (£6.3million), right-back Habib Beye (£2million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3–1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> the opening nine league games. However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run-up to Christmas, and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge {{starting}} on 10 June with ten wins and two <b>draws</b> <b>from</b> twelve tour matches, with eight innings victories. It was thought that Bradman would play a specialist leg spinner, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston, a left-arm paceman and orthodox spinner, was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. This was the only change from the teams that Australia had fielded in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour, as the surface of the pitch had become moist following overnight rain, assisting seam bowling. Australia's selection policy meant that their reserve opener Brown would bat out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, while Neil Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E
