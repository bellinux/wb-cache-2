40|$|G 18. 93 - 0. 03 is a {{prominent}} dust complex within an 0. 8 deg long filament, with the molecular clump G 18. 93 /m being <b>IR</b> <b>dark</b> from near IR wavelength up to 160 mu. Spitzer composite images show an IR bubble spatially associated with G 18. 93. We use GRS 13 CO and IRAM 30 m H 13 CO+ data to disentangle the spatial {{structure of the}} region. From ATLASGAL submm data we calculate the gas mass, while we use the H 13 CO+ line width to estimate its virial mass. Using HERSCHEL data we produce temperature maps from fitting the SED. With the MAGPIS 20 cm and SuperCOSMOS Halpha data we trace the ionized gas, and the VGPS HI survey provides information on the atomic hydrogen gas. We show that the bubble is spatially associated with G 18. 93, located at a kinematic near distance of 3. 6 kpc. With 280 Msun, the most massive clump within G 18. 93 is G 18. 93 /m. The virial analysis shows {{that it may be}} gravitationally bound and has neither Spitzer young stellar objects nor mid-IR point sources within. Fitting the SED reveals a temperature distribution that decreases towards its center, but heating from the ionizing source puts it above the general ISM temperature. We find that the bubble is filled by HII gas, ionized by an O 8. 5 star. Between the ionizing source and the <b>IR</b> <b>dark</b> clump G 18. 93 /m we find a layered structure, from ionized to atomic to molecular hydrogen, revealing a PDR. Furthermore, we identify an additional velocity component within the bubble's 8 mu emission rim {{at the edge of the}} infrared dark cloud and speculate that it might be shock induced by the expanding HII region. While the elevated temperature allows for the build-up of larger fragments, and the shock induced velocity component may lead to additional turbulent support, we do not find conclusive evidence that the massive clump G 18. 93 /m is prone to collapse because of the expanding HII region.

40|$|The Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G 028. 23 - 00. 19 hosts {{a massive}} (1, 500 Msun), cold (12 K), and 3. 6 - 70 um <b>IR</b> <b>dark</b> clump (MM 1) {{that has the}} {{potential}} to form high-mass stars. We observed this prestellar clump candidate with the SMA (~ 3. 5 " resolution) and JVLA (~ 2. 1 " resolution) in order to characterize the early stages of high-mass star formation and to constrain theoretical models. Dust emission at 1. 3 mm wavelength reveals 5 cores with masses < 15 Msun. None of the cores currently have the mass reservoir to form a high-mass star in the prestellar phase. If the MM 1 clump will ultimately form high-mass stars, its embedded cores must gather a significant amount of additional mass over time. No molecular outflows are detected in the CO (2 - 1) and SiO (5 - 4) transitions, suggesting that the SMA cores are starless. By using the NH 3 (1, 1) line, the velocity dispersion of the gas is determined to be transonic or mildly supersonic (DeltaV_nt}/DeltaV_th ~ 1. 1 - 1. 8). The cores are not highly supersonic as some theories of high-mass star formation predict. The embedded cores are 4 to 7 times more massive than the clump thermal Jeans mass and the most massive core (SMA 1) is 9 times less massive than the clump turbulent Jeans mass. These values indicate that neither thermal pressure nor turbulent pressure dominates the fragmentation of MM 1. The low virial parameters of the cores (0. 1 - 0. 5) suggest that they are not in virial equilibrium, unless strong magnetic fields of ~ 1 - 2 mG are present. We discuss high-mass star formation scenarios in a context based on IRDC G 028. 23 - 00. 19, a study case believed to represent the initial fragmentation of molecular clouds that will form high-mass stars.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies {{in terms of}} mass accretion and matter transport is still an open topic in research. My thesis consists of two parts that are bridged by a common theme: {{the properties of the}} interstellar medium interstellar matter (ISM) and star formation in centers of galaxies, studied in the (sub-) mm wavelength regime. The first part of my thesis deals with the results from Submillimeter Array (SMA) ob- servations of molecular gas (low CO transitions) at sub-kpc (∼ 3 ′′) resolution of three Seyfert 1 galaxies from the ’low-luminosity quasi stellar object (LLQSO) sample’, which covers a redshift range of z ∼ 0. 01 - 0. 06. The goal of the LLQSO sample is investigate the signs of internal or external triggers enhanced activity (i. e., star formation and accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH)) in the centers of galaxies and their frequency with respect to the nuclear activity. Two sources, HE 0433 - 1028 and HE 1108 - 2813, were observed in 12 CO(2 – 1) and 13 CO(2 – 1) and the third, HE 1029 - 1831, in 12 CO(3 – 2) and HCO+(4 – 3) line emission. In- triguingly, in all three galaxies the molecular gas accumulates at the center within a radius 20 in the central region, indicating them to be warm and/or turbulent. Strikingly, also the 12 CO(3 – 2) /(1 – 0) line luminosity ratio in HE 1029 - 1831 suggests a higher excitation phase with r 31 ∼ 1, apart from the cold or diffuse gas phase implied by r 21 ∼ 0. 5 for all three of them. From this, together with the Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG) typical infrared luminosities of L_IR ≥ 10 ^ 11 L⊙, I conclude that the emission in the centers of these Seyferts is strongly affected by diffuse gas due to violent star formation. Indeed, the centers of these galaxies seem to contain a circumnuclear starburst with minimum molecular gas mass and starformation rate (SFR) surface densities around Σ_mol = 70 - 540 M⊙ pc− 2 and Σ_SFR = 1. 3 - 3. 8 M⊙ kpc− 2 yr− 1. Therefore, the galaxies’ ISM state is likely to be better described by a mass conversion factor typical for Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), as suggested by the dynamical and dust masses. My work on these data shows how much information {{on the state of the}} molecular gas can already be obtained from these medium spatial resolutions, i. e. on 0. 5 - 1 kpc-scales. The second part covers interferometric continuum and line emission data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of the inner 4 parsec (approximately 100 ′′) surrounding the SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), at the Galactic Center (GC). It is a region of extreme conditions not only in terms of intense IR to UV radiation from the nuclear stellar/star cluster (NSC) and X-ray emission from a population of stellar remnants and Sgr A*, but especilly in terms of turbulence and shocks due to stellar winds and tidal shear. Furthermore, it comprises several overlapping molecular and ionized structures that can be studied in term of feeding inflow and star formation potential. Its proximity makes the GC a unique laboratory for our understanding of galactic nuclei and galaxy evolution on the smallest accessible scales. I present serendipitous detections of line emission towards Sgr A* and its environment with ALMA in band 3, 6, and 7. This up to now highest resolution (< 0. 75 ′′) view of the GC in the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) domain shows molecular gas at projected distances 1 ′′ from the SMBH. Among the highlights are: the very first 340 GHz map of the minispiral, the very first and highly resolved detection of sub-mm molecular emission in the immedi- ate vicinity of the SMBH, and the highly resolved structures of circumnuclear disk (CND) features, especially of a region comprising a methanol class I maser closest to the SMBH. The emission in H 39 α and of the 100 GHz continuum imply a uniform electron temper- ature around Te ∼ 6000 K for the minispiral. Sgr A* has a spectral index (S ∝ ν^α) of α ∼ 0. 5 at 100 - 250 GHz and α ∼ 0. 0 at 230 - 340 GHz. The spectral indices of the luminous objects in the inner minispiral tend to - 0. 1 indication Bremsstrahlung emission, while the minispiral exterior shows the growing importance of the dust component with increasing frequency. The clumpy molecular gas distribution is represented best by the CS emission. Further species detected are H 13 CO+, HC 3 N, SiO, SO, C 2 H, CH 3 OH, 13 CS and N 2 H+. Most of the emission can be found at positive velocities and in a region limited by the sources IRS 3 and 7, and the minispiral Bar and Northern Arm. For some few regions in the field, the molecular emission appears at velocities of up to 200 km s− 1. Probably, this central association (CA) of clouds is an infalling group of clouds composed of denser cloud cores and diffuse gas. I cal- culated three times higher CS/X (X: any other observed molecule) ratios for the CA than for the CND which hints at a combination of higher excitation - by a temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping - and abundance enhancement due to UV- and/or X-ray emission. Assuming the NSC as the cause, CA must be closer to the center than the CND is to the center. Within the CND itself, I discerned two interesting regions: One region emits in lines of all molecular species and higher energy levels observed in this and earlier studies. Further- more, it harbours a methanol class I maser. The other region shows line ratios similar to the CA. Beyond the CND, I discover that the largest accumulations of traditionally quies- cent gas tracer N 2 H+ match the largest infared (<b>IR)</b> <b>dark</b> clouds in the field. The previously detected methanol class I masers in these infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) coincide with the methanol emission observed by ALMA. I conclude, that all of these special regions should be investigated in more detail in the context of hot/cold core and extreme photon dominated region (PDR) /X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry and consequent star formation in the GC. My work on these ALMA Cycle 0 data give a prospect on the many riddles to solve - and to discover - thanks to the superb resolution of the current ALMA facility...|$|E

40|$|Neurons synthesizing neurokinin B (NKB) and kisspeptin (KP) in the {{hypothalamic}} {{arcuate nucleus}} represent important upstream regulators of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurosecretion. In search of neuropeptides co-expressed in analogous neurons {{of the human}} infundibular nucleus (Inf), we have carried out immunohistochemical studies of the tachykinin peptide Substance P (SP) in autopsy samples from men (21 - 78 years) and postmenopausal (53 - 83 years) women. Significantly higher numbers of SP-immunoreactive (<b>IR)</b> neurons and <b>darker</b> labeling were observed in the Inf of postmenopausal women than in age-matched men. Triple-immunofluorescent studies localized SP immunoreactivity to considerable subsets of KP-IR and NKB-IR axons and perikarya in the infundibular region. In postmenopausal women, 25. 1 % of NKB-IR and 30. 6 % of KP-IR perikarya contained SP and 16. 5 % of all immunolabeled cell bodies were triple-labeled. Triple-, double- and single-labeled SP-IR axons innervated densely the portal capillaries of the infundibular stalk. In quadruple-labeled sections, these axons formed occasional contacts with GnRH-IR axons. Presence of SP in NKB and KP neurons increases the functional complexity of the putative pulse generator network.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in complex physical situations such as nucleate boiling, quenching and dropwise condensation is strongly {{affected by the}} presence of a liquid–vapor–solid triple contact line, where intense energy transfer and phase change occur. A novel experimental technique for the detection of the liquid–vapor–solid line in these situations is presented. The technique is based on high-speed infrared (IR) thermometry through an IR-transparent silicon wafer heater; hence the name DEPIcT, or DEtection of Phase by Infrared Thermometry. Where the heater surface is wet, the IR camera measures the temperature of the hot water in contact with the heater. On the other hand, where vapor (whose IR absorptivity is very low) is in contact with the heater, the IR light comes from the cooler water beyond the vapor. The resulting <b>IR</b> image appears <b>dark</b> (cold) in dry spots and bright (hot) in wetted area. Using the contrast between the dark and bright areas, we can visualize the distribution of the liquid and gas phases in contact with the heater surface, and thus identify the liquid–vapor–solid contact line. In other words, we measure temperature beyond the surface to detect phases on the surface. It was shown that even small temperature differences (∼ 1 °C) can yield a sharp identification of the contact line, within about 100 μm resolution. DEPIcT was also shown to be able to detect thin liquid layers, through the analysis of interference patterns. Korean Science and Engineering Foundation ((MEST) (No. 2010 - 0018761) ...|$|R
40|$|I will {{describe}} the scientific program anticipated for the James Webb Space Telescope and the progress in its construction. When the JWST was conceived in 1995 {{it was expected}} to make its greatest contributions {{in the study of}} the first objects to form after the Big Bang, in the evolution of galaxies, and in the formation and evolution of stars and planetary systems. Since then, the age-distance-redshift relation has become clear with the precise measurement of the Hubble constant, the discovery of the accelerating universe, and the remarkable agreement of CMBR calculations with direct measurements of the large-scale structure. So what is left and what has changed? Galaxy formation and growth is still mysterious, star formation is still hidden, the dark matter and dark energy are still unobservable, and the tools at hand may or may not help enough. But the JWST, as a general-purpose observatory, will be available for imaginative use, and is just what Simon White's polemic seems to request. As an example, the JWST should be quite capable of observing transiting exoplanets with remarkable precision, even though there was no requirement to do so, and its coronagraphs will be very good even without a monolithic primary mirror. The JWST mission has now been officially approved by NASA and is in the Federal budget. It is planned for launch in 2014. Flight instruments will begin to arrive at Goddard in mid- 2010, and the first flight mirror segments have already passed their first cryogenic tests.
