5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city,</b> she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} based on a real {{experience}} Carrier had as a child in Sainte-Justine, Quebec in 1946 as a fan of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its star player, Maurice Richard. Carrier and his friends all wear Canadiens' sweaters with Richard's number 9 on the back. When his mother orders a new sweater from the department store <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> after the old one has worn out, he is mistakenly sent a sweater of Montreal's bitter rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, instead. Carrier faces the persecution of his peers and his coach prevents him from playing.|$|E

That would not matter on the court as the Nats held their own {{finishing}} in 2nd place with a 41–31 record. However, in the playoffs the Nationals would fall {{in the first round}} as they lost a 3-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.|$|E

25|$|Each game in {{this series}} allows players {{to take on the}} role of a {{criminal}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city,</b> typically an individual who plans to rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also involved in the game.|$|E
25|$|When he was 15, {{a case of}} measles left young Hal {{with what}} doctors {{believed}} to be an early case of tuberculosis. His divorced mother moved with Hal and two brothers to {{the country for a}} year, {{while the rest of the}} family lived with his father in Philadelphia and attended school there. While his mother raced off to Wilmington every week to speak and organize literature sales, she being the Delaware state organizer for the Socialist Party, Hal seems to have taken fondly to rural life. Although he would return to school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city</b> the following year, his orientation towards the countryside was firmly established.|$|E
25|$|One of Simmel's {{most notable}} essays is The Metropolis and Mental Life (Die Großstadt und das Geistesleben) from 1903, which was {{originally}} given {{as one of}} a series of lectures on all aspects of city life by experts in various fields, ranging from science and religion to art. The series was conducted alongside the Dresden cities exhibition of 1903. Simmel was originally asked to lecture on the role of intellectual (or scholarly) life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city,</b> but he effectively reversed the topic in order to analyze the effects of the big city on the mind of the individual. As a result, when the lectures were published as essays in a book, to fill the gap, the series editor himself had to supply an essay on the original topic.|$|E

500|$|Comics scholar Jeet Heer called Rarebit Fiend [...] "perhaps {{the most}} bizarre {{newspaper}} feature in American history". [...] Merkl notes examples of the strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another woman out a window, as in Luis Buñuel's film L'Age d'Or (1930); and giant characters let loose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city,</b> climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in King Kong (1933). [...] Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child's bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 Ray Bradbury story [...] "The Veldt", and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a stretchable face, to Salvador Dalí's surrealist painting Soft self-portrait with fried bacon (1941) and the cosmetic surgeries in Terry Gilliam's Brazil. [...] Stephen R. Bissette compares a strip featuring elevators flying from buildings and other scenes to the 2005 Tim Burton take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, she portrayed an actress with a fatal heart {{condition}} in Walter Lang's Sentimental Journey. A commercially successful production, O'Hara {{described it as}} a [...] "rip-your-heart-out tearjerker that reduced my agents and the toughest brass at Fox to mush when they saw it". Critically it was poorly received, and was later declared by Harvard as the worst film of all time. One critic attacked O'Hara with saying [...] "just another one of those precious Hollywood juvenile products who in workday life would benefit from a good hiding", while Bosley Crowther dismissed the film was a [...] "compound of hackneyed situations, maudlin dialogue and preposterously bad acting". In Gregory Ratoff's musical Do You Love Me, O'Hara portrayed a prim, bespectacled music school dean who transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city.</b> She commented that it was [...] "one of the worst pictures I ever made". It frustrated her that she could not put her talents to good use, to not even sing in it.|$|E

Following this [...] "Oh What a Circus" [...] begins, where Banderas takes the lead vocals. Built on the uptempo melody of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", the song has rock influences and piano sounds. After a short interlude by Nail, [...] "On This Night of a Thousand Stars", a distorted electric guitar and bass heralds [...] "Eva and Magaldi / Eva Beware of the City". Here the lyrics talk about warning Eva from strangers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city.</b> The sound of train horns, Latin percussion, drums, and light guitars introduce [...] "Buenos Aires", talking about Eva finally arriving in the city. The melody finds Madonna singing in a higher range, and the song has a heavy composition in the middle with guitar, trumpets and [...] music. [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] begins with soft strummed guitar in broken chords, and consists of strings and acoustic guitar played in a subdued manner. Madonna sings about Eva moving from one home to another, portraying an image—the suitcase in the hall—"to express the nomadic nature of modern civilization".|$|E

500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>city,</b> ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
