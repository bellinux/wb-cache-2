5|$|<b>Demolition</b> and The Hart Foundation {{had faced}} each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988, where <b>Demolition</b> had {{successfully}} defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team. They announced on the March 31 episode of WWF Superstars {{that they wanted to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship after the WrestleMania match between The Colossal Connection and <b>Demolition.</b> After <b>Demolition</b> won the match, The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. <b>Demolition</b> interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of WWF Superstars, <b>Demolition</b> and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that <b>Demolition</b> having three members was evidence of cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was announced for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated {{that it would be a}} two out of three falls match and that only two members of <b>Demolition</b> would be allowed at ringside.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the <b>demolition,</b> mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the <b>demolition.</b> He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the <b>demolition.</b> Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were {{a major factor in the}} mob's behaviour.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of house <b>demolitions</b> as a deterrence has been questioned. In 2005 an Israeli Army commission to study house <b>demolitions</b> found {{no proof of}} effective deterrence {{and concluded that the}} damage caused by the <b>demolitions</b> overrides its effectiveness. As a result, the IDF approved the commission's recommendations to end punitive <b>demolitions</b> of Palestinian houses.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} a plausibly exogenous {{source of}} variation in housing assistance generated by public housing <b>demolitions</b> in Chicago to {{examine the impact of}} high-rise public housing on student outcomes. I find that children in households affected by the <b>demolitions</b> do no better or worse than their peers {{on a wide variety of}} achievement measures. Because the majority of households that leave high-rise public housing in response to the <b>demolitions</b> move to neighborhoods and schools that closely resemble those they left, the zero effect of the <b>demolitions</b> may be interpreted as the independent impact of public housing. ...|$|R

5|$|Following the pier's {{decommissioning}} on 12 November 2006, <b>demolition</b> work started amidst protests. The <b>demolition</b> {{was originally}} {{scheduled for the}} early part of 2007, but <b>demolition</b> was brought forward by 3 months, to 12 December 2006. The government ignored a nonbinding motion in September in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong urging it to retain the pier and clock tower.|$|E
5|$|In June 1990, {{while still}} {{working for the}} PNW, Adams debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Crush, the third member of the Tag Team Champions <b>Demolition.</b> With Adams joining <b>Demolition,</b> the trio {{exercised}} the Freebird Rule allowing any combination of the three to defend the tag team title, which allowed Crush to become a Tag Team Champion. He was brought in {{as a substitute for}} Ax to defend the titles with Smash. Crush debuted at a live event on June 5, where he and Smash successfully defended the titles against The Rockers. Crush made his televised debut with <b>Demolition</b> on the June 23 episode of Superstars, teaming with Smash in a quick victory over Paul Diamond and Joe Champ. On the July 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, Crush and Smash retained the titles against The Rockers, after Ax (who was the illegal man) clotheslined and pinned Shawn Michaels. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, <b>Demolition,</b> with new member Crush, lost the title to The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match with Crush getting pinned for the final fall to lose the title. After SummerSlam, <b>Demolition</b> shifted focus from the belts to their already incipient feud with The Legion of Doom which had intensified after the latter team interfered in the title change match. Adams continued to perform as part of <b>Demolition</b> until after WrestleMania VII where he and Smash lost to Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao. After WrestleMania, the WWF decided to disband <b>Demolition</b> as a team.|$|E
5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the <b>demolition</b> of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the <b>demolition</b> of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the <b>demolition</b> are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the <b>demolition</b> of the wall.|$|E
40|$|In November 2012, the Gauteng Provincial Government engaged on a {{programme}} {{to demolish}} houses that were illegally built on government land in Lenasia, a suburb located 30 kilometres south of Johannesburg. Over 50 homes were demolished with further <b>demolitions</b> being scheduled. The <b>demolitions</b> spurred various actors into action. Following a court interdict applied {{for by the}} South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) {{on behalf of the}} residents, the government was then forced to cease with the <b>demolitions.</b> Within the dispute various claims have been advanced and legitimation processes entered into. This study uses the case of the <b>demolitions</b> in Lenasia to investigate the nature of legitimation and the framing of claims. This is done through a consideration of the different actors in the <b>demolitions</b> and each of the claims advanced. The central claims of this work are that legitimacy is context-specific and in a state of constant formation. Furthermore, claims are used to express worldviews and they serve as strategic standpoints for access to various goods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether house <b>demolitions</b> are {{an effective}} counterterrorism tactic against suicide terrorism. We link original longitudinal micro-level data on houses demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces with {{data on the}} universe of suicide attacks against Israeli targets. By exploiting spatial and time variation in house <b>demolitions</b> and suicide terror attacks during the second Palestinian uprising, we show that punitive house <b>demolitions</b> (those targeting Palestinian suicide terrorists and terror operatives) cause an immediate, significant {{decrease in the number}} of suicide attacks. The effect dissipates over time and by geographic distance. In contrast, we observe that precautionary house <b>demolitions</b> (<b>demolitions</b> justified by the location of the house but not related to the identity or any action of the house’s owner) cause a significant increase in the number of suicide terror attacks. The results are consistent with the view that selective violence is an effective tool to combat terrorist groups, whereas indiscriminate violence backfires. ...|$|R

5|$|The Arch <b>demolition</b> was {{formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the <b>demolition</b> inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the <b>demolition.</b> Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. <b>Demolition</b> began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E

5|$|The seventh {{match of}} the night was for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Reigning champions <b>Demolition</b> (Ax and Smash), {{accompanied}} by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart, were challenged by The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). As soon as the bell sounded, The Hart Foundation attacked both members of <b>Demolition.</b> Their control was brief, as <b>Demolition</b> then gained the advantage over Neidhart. As Bret Hart was tagged into the match, <b>Demolition</b> got the advantage over {{him when he was}} whipped shoulder first into the turnbuckle, breaking Mr. Fuji's cane that he had placed there when the referee wasn't looking. After a few minutes of <b>Demolition</b> working over Hart's shoulder, a frustrated Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match. When all four men began fighting inside the ring, Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji, who was on the ring apron. At the end of the match, Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him a megaphone given by Jimmy Hart sneaking back to the ring. Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win.|$|E

5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the <b>demolition</b> {{funding was}} {{appropriated}} in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development Block Grant. According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for the <b>demolition</b> of the bridge, and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the <b>demolition</b> of the bridge was given to S Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge. The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal.|$|E

5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the <b>demolition</b> of the whole complex. Before the scheduled <b>demolition</b> in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the <b>demolition,</b> an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
