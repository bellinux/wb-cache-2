30|$|Explosion {{prevention}} {{is dependent on}} an ability to detect and identify potential threats. Only then {{is it possible to}} <b>document,</b> <b>register,</b> and evaluate the threats comprehensively. An effective preventive protocol involves making contingency plans for possible explosions. Each step of the above process requires consistent government spending and input, which may include policy incentives, financial support, and human resources. Governments may install fiscal incentive policies that promote work safety and explosion prevention. These policies might include tax cuts for technology firms that specialize in explosion hazards control. Governments need to increase fiscal spending on work safety and explosion prevention and put such spending into their budgets. Moreover, government entities at all levels should also manage work safety funds to raise their efficiency of use. It is necessary for governments not only to employ safety experts to provide training and consultation, but also to attract outstanding personnel to join the public administration sector. Governments can also set up special education programs to train personnel for industrial explosion hazards control.|$|E
