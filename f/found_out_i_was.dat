Then my agent says, 'Oh, The Simpsons want you in an episode.' Once you've gone yellow, you've made it. My ideal show would be where I have a cartoon relapse with Barney and Homer and get smashed {{out of my mind}} with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday {{is just a little}} bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck? This is so cool! Let's do something together!"" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death at 27, Cosby was working toward his {{doctorate}} in special education at Columbia University's Teachers College. He planned to set up a school for children with learning disabilities. He once wrote, [...] "The happiest day of my life occurred when I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dyslexic. I believe that life is finding solutions, and the worst feeling to me is confusion." [...] Ennis was recalled as friendly and outgoing, and he would greet people with, [...] "Hello, friend," [...] a greeting that became his legacy. His parents had the phrase put on a sign near his grave, and several months after his death, his father released a jazz collection titled, Hello, Friend: To Ennis With Love.|$|E

2500|$|Early into New York Islanders {{training}} camp, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, having {{played the}} previous {{season in the}} KHL, was deeply saddened by the news and {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I think I knew 80 percent of the team. Either I played with them or I played against them. You see each other in different tournaments. Some of them you're really close with, or some them you just say hi and have a couple of laughs with. [...] It struck me when I <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough. You have chills and you just hope that the families will find the strength to fight through something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You make me so darn tired, Hawk. You {{talk about}} my having to learn to chum with people in overalls. You've got to learn not to let people in evening clothes put {{anything}} over on you. That's your difficulty from having lived in the back-country these {{last two or three}} years. You have an instinct for manners. But I did notice that as soon as you <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the army you spent half the time disliking me as a militarist, and the other half expecting me to be haughty--Lord knows what over. It took you two weeks to think of me as Forrest Haviland. I'm ashamed of you! If you're a socialist you ought to think that anything you like belongs to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure! He's got a {{wife and}} two kids here in Boston. That was a twenty-one round knockout! Maybe I didn't have {{something}} to tell him when he blew into Hampton last Friday! But he said he couldn't help it--he loved me." [...] Lise sat up, seemingly finding relief in the relation of her wrongs, dabbing her eyes with a cheap lace handkerchief. [...] "Well, while he'd been away--this thing came. I didn't know what was the matter at first, and when I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared to death, I was ready to kill myself.

6000|$|It {{was only}} in the morning, over our coffee (Friday, September 27th), that this couple <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a heretic. I suppose I had misled them by some admiring {{expressions}} as to the monastic life around us; and it was only by a point-blank question that the truth came out. I had been tolerantly used both by simple Father Apollinaris and astute Father Michael; and the good Irish deacon, when he heard of my religious weakness, had only patted me upon the shoulder and said, [...] "You must be a Catholic and come to heaven." [...] But I was now among a different sect of orthodox. These two men were bitter and upright and narrow, like the worst of Scotsmen, and indeed, upon my heart, I fancy they were worse. The priest snorted aloud like a battle-horse.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's prejudice," [...] she objected, {{shaking her}} head. [...] "Nowadays {{there are few}} things a woman can't do.

6000|$|... "I {{am talking}} about Mr. Hemphill; Mr. Rupert Hemphill; who, about seven years ago, was engaged in the Philadelphia Navy-Yard, and who came to your house on {{business}} with your father. From {{what you told me}} of him I conjectured that he might now be my husband's Philadelphia secretary, for his name is Rupert, and I had reason to believe that he was once engaged in the navy-yard. When I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entirely correct in my supposition I had him sent here, and I looked forward with the most joyous anticipations to being present when you first saw him. But it was all a fiasco! I suppose some people might think I was unwarrantably meddling in the affairs of others, but as it was in my power to create a most charming romance, I could not let the opportunity pass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I wasn't on {{the landing}} a moment before he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there. He turned on me sharply, and I saw {{the face of an}} {{immature}} young man, a weak nose, a scrubby little moustache, a feeble chin. So for an instant we stood--he looking over his shoulder at me and regarded one another. Then he seemed to remember his high calling. He turned round, drew himself up, projected his face, raised his arms, spread his hands in approved ghost fashion--came towards me. As he did so his little jaw dropped, and he emitted a faint, drawn-out 'Boo.' No, it wasn't--not a bit dreadful. I'd dined. I'd had a bottle of champagne, and being all alone, perhaps two or three--perhaps even four or five--whiskies, so I was as solid as rocks and no more frightened than if I'd been assailed by a frog. 'Boo!' I said. 'Nonsense. You don't belong to THIS place. What are you doing here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There {{are plenty}} of spicy old women, who settled I was a bad bold thing. They <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the ‘gay’ line. They {{discovered}} I was known to the authorities. I am very well known all out West—I’m known from Chicago to San Francisco; if not personally, at least by reputation. I’m known to all classes. People can tell you out there. In New York they decided I wasn’t good enough. Not good enough for New York! What {{do you say to}} that?”—it rang out for derision. Whether she had struggled with her pride before making her avowal her confidant of this occasion never knew. The strange want of dignity, as he felt, in her grievance seemed to indicate that she had no pride, and yet there was a sore spot, really a deep wound, in her heart which, touched again, renewed its ache. “I took a house for the winter—one of the handsomest houses in the place—but I sat there all alone. They thought me ‘gay,’ me gay there on Fifty-Eighth Street {{without so much as a}} cat!” ...|$|E
6000|$|The other smiled. [...] "I've {{felt like}} that about risky jobs I took.
