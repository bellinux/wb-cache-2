30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the final results}} on the implementation, impacts, costs, and economic benefits of the UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) programme, which sought to improve the labour market prospects of low-paid workers and long-term unemployed people. The paper also highlights some of the methodological contributions of the demonstration, {{such as the use}} of cross-office analysis to learn from positive impacts in order to refine policy and, in time, raise overall effectiveness. Launched in 2003 in selected Jobcentre Plus offices, which administer Government cash benefits and employment services, the programme was envisioned as a ‘next step’ in British welfare-to-work policies. Participants in ERA had access to a distinctive set of ‘post-employment’ job coaching and financial incentives, which were added to the job placement services that unemployed people could normally receive through Jobcentre Plus. Once employed, ERA participants could receive at least 2 years of advice and assistance from an <b>employment</b> <b>adviser</b> to help them continue working and advance in work. Those who consistently worked full time could receive substantial cash rewards, called ‘retention bonuses’. Participants could also receive help with tuition costs and cash rewards for completing training courses while employed. The programme has been carefully evaluated though a large-scale randomised control trial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The UK Equality Act 2010 {{makes it}} {{unlawful}} for employers to ask health questions before making {{an offer of}} employment except in certain circumstances. While the majority of employers would prefer applicants to disclose a mental illness at the application stage, many people either wait until they have accepted the job and then disclose to an occupational health professional, or do not do so at all due to the anticipation of discrimination or a wish for privacy. However, non disclosure precludes the ability to request reasonable adjustments in the workplace or to make a claim of direct discrimination. Disclosure to employers is therefore a difficult decision. A recent pilot study by our group of the CORAL decision aid showed that it helped mental health service users clarify their needs and values regarding disclosure and led to reduction in decisional conflict. The present proof of concept trial aims {{to determine whether a}} full scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) is justifiable and feasible, and to optimise its design. Methods In this single blind exploratory RCT in London, a total of 80 participants (inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years, on the caseload of a specialist <b>employment</b> <b>adviser</b> working with people with mental illness; referred to the adviser either from primary care via Improving Access to Psychological Therapies or secondary mental health service; currently seeking or interested in either paid or voluntary employment, and a Decisional Conflict Scale score of 37. 5 or greater and stage of decision score 1 – 5) will be recruited from vocational advice services. After completing a baseline assessment, participants will be {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions (1) Use of the CORAL Decision Aid (DA) in addition to treatment as usual or (2) Treatment as usual. Those allocated to the DA condition will be given it to read and complete, and the researcher will be present to record the time taken and any content that causes confusion. Intervention participants may keep the decision aid but are discouraged from showing it to other service users to avoid contamination. Follow up interviews will be conducted at 3 months. Primary outcomes are: (i) stage of decision making score; (ii) decisional conflict scores and (iii) employment related outcomes. Secondary analyses will identify predictors of disclosure and qualitative analysis will explore the impact of the intervention. Discussion A reduction in decisional conflict regarding disclosure leading to more effective job seeking activity could have significant economic consequences for people with mental illness in terms of employment rates and productivity.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{was commissioned}} {{at the start}} of the Employment Advisor (EA) pilot in 2009. Its aim was to test the proposition that the provision of integrated mental health and employment advice services would reduce the incidence of health-related job loss, increase the likelihood of an earlier return to work following health-related absence and reduce the number of people accessing out-of-work benefits. The evaluation relies upon a quantitative and qualitative methodology by drawing upon administrative data from both the EA and Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services, a longitudinal survey of EA clients (summer 2010 and early 2011), in-depth interviews with a sample of EA clients and semi-structured interviews with employment advisers and other key personnel including IAPT therapists and commissioners. In 2009 we introduced the EA pilot programme to complement the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme in England, with the aim of helping individuals with mental health problems retain employment or return to work. Similar EA pilots were set up in Scotland and Wales. The IAPT EA pilots formed part of government’s Health Work and Wellbeing initiative, which included a number of proof of concept pilots that provided support for individuals, employers and healthcare professionals with the aim of reducing sickness absence and job loss and addressing the economic costs of ill health estimated as over £ 100 billion annually by Dame Carol Black in her 2008 review. The EA in IAPT evaluation has informed the development of the government’s response to the independent Sickness Absence Review, in particular consideration of the health and work advisory service. It provides new evidence of how employment advice can complement health support for employees with mental health issues, particularly where they are struggling at work or on sickness absence. This evaluation’s findings also complement those of the Fit for Work Service evaluation. Both pilots showed that when people have employment as well as health problems they value coordinated help from both employment and health services. This evaluation adds to the evidence base for early intervention to reduce the risk of health related job loss and flows onto benefits. It will be of interest to commissioners of psychological therapy services as it contributes to the case for commissioning employment advice alongside therapy for working age users of mental health services. Information from these pilots has already informed IAPT commissioning guidance and services are encouraged to make provision for one <b>employment</b> <b>adviser</b> to every eight therapists. In addition some Primary Care Trusts continue to fund Employment Support Coordinators whose role complements that of Jobcentre Plus’s District Mental Health Partnership managers...|$|E
40|$|A {{report of}} {{research}} {{carried out by}} the Institute for Employment Studies on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions This report presents qualitative findings from the study of the School Gates Employment Initiative. This mostly involved qualitative research in 13 of the 25 pilot areas which included interviews with school heads, Regional Development Agency (RDA) leads, Jobcentre Plus, local authorities (LAs) and devolved administrations, parents and parent support staff in schools. It also involved two semi-structured group discussions with local partners at two practitioner events in November 2010, as well as a review of evidence presented in the Management Information (MI) and the quarterly reports from the pilot areas. The findings of this report strongly support the notion that schools, Jobcentre Plus and LA <b>employment</b> <b>advisers</b> can play a potentially important role in moving parents from low incomes towards work. School Gates’ reach to potential second earners and parents on low incomes, many of whom are not on benefits and are new customers to Jobcentre Plus, has been a key strength of the pilot. Many parents engaged in the pilot were also lone parents, some of whom were also not in receipt of benefits. In this way, many school sites have provided a critical mass of families within these target groups for Jobcentre Plus and other LA <b>employment</b> <b>advisers</b> to engage with...|$|R

40|$|Every {{organisation}} in the UK {{is affected}} by mental distress and ill-health in the workforce. The first point of contact for most people with common mental health problems, such as mild to moderate anxiety or depression, is their general practitioner. The location of specialist <b>employment</b> <b>advisers</b> in GP surgeries is therefore a logical attempt {{to address the issue}} of people falling out of the workplace, through the provision of early intervention and combined vocational and psychological treatment packages. In 2007 the Richmond Fellowship, a national mental health charity, received a grant to provide four employment advisors to work with GP surgeries in Eastern England. The aim was to help people with mental health problems gain work (Regain clients) or retain their current employment (Retain clients). In this study a realistic evaluation framework was applied to address the question of what works, for whom and in which contexts through interviews with key stakeholders including 22 clients of the project, five primary health care staff and the four <b>employment</b> <b>advisers.</b> The interventions that Retain clients found most helpful were careers guidance (including psychological profiling) and developing strategies to negotiate and communicate with employers. These appeared to help individuals to take control, broaden their horizons and move forward. In many cases this was supported by assistance in helping clients think through whether they wanted to consider a career change. For Regain clients the most important interventions were help with interview skills, CV writing and assertiveness training. Employment outcomes were considerably higher for the Retain clients than for the Regain clients. The study indicates that it could be more effective for Retain and Regain services to be delivered through different care pathways to avoid diluting the services offered and consequently reducing their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{employment}} {{advice and}} guidance {{services in the}} UK have occupied distinct realms despite government efforts to align and integrate the education and skills and welfare-to-work frameworks. Conceptually, studies of front-line service delivery have often adopted a street-level perspective. This study offers a governance approach that focuses on how adviser behaviour is steered through managerial methods and how advisers steer user behaviour {{through the use of}} discretion and trust. The study explored how advisers mediated the tensions between managerial concerns and user needs to achieve policy goals, among others to turn service users into more active citizens. Based on 38 semi-structured interviews with service managers and advisers in combination with service characteristics and policy aims, a service typology was developed which was then applied to eight case study services. The analysis showed that <b>employment</b> <b>advisers</b> in the different service types applied very diverse strategies to achieve an outcome for the service user, but that within service types the strategies were similar. Due to the different service structures and advisers’ varying ability to apply discretion, various kinds of trust could be established, which potentially allowed the advisers to influence a change of service user behaviour. This could range from highly coercive methods to empowering individuals. The findings showed that advisers were subject to similar pressures as they applied to service users when mediating managerial influences. There was evidence that ability to use discretion was a vital pivot point in how advisers mediated tension between the service demands and user needs. This in turn was related to the adviser’s ability to achieve sustainable outcomes for the service user...|$|R

40|$|Background Acknowledging {{individual}} and societal consequences of long term sickness absence, a political awareness is raising in Belgium {{in favour of}} a more active reintegration policy. Since various stakeholders are implied and several legislations may apply, it was deemed necessary to analyse the interplay between regulations {{and the role of}} the respective interveners to optimise return to work practices. The study focused on workers who are still under contract. Methods To this purpose, 23 representatives of various categories of stakeholders were interviewed: social insurance physicians, occupational physicians, insurers, social administration services, employers, unions, <b>employment</b> <b>advisers,</b> etc… Interviewees were asked to describe their role, to identify difficulties in the execution of their mission and sources of conflict between legislations, and to propose improvements. The interviews were audiotaped and fully transcribed. Results Several barriers to worker reintegration were pointed out during the interviews. On individual level, the worker social situation and a lack of information influence the chance of a successful return to work. At the enterprise level, the enterprise size, quality of peer support and lack of financial incentives were often mentioned. Most remarks concerned legislation. In Belgian labour law, the employment contract may be ended if the employee is permanently unable to perform his current job, even though modified work would remain possible. For many stakeholders, a sustainable return to work is hindered by the complexity of legislation which was developed for different domains (disability benefits, unemployment, work accident, occupational disease) with little attention to transitions from one domain to the other, especially between benefit insurance and unemployment legislation. It was also stressed that the possibilities offered by the occupational health legislation are underused or inappropriately used. Conclusions Legal and financial security must be insured for the worker who is ready to enrol in a reintegration trajectory. Public authorities should promote better knowledge and implementation of reintegration policies and current legislation should be improved with an emphasis on a better collaboration between stakeholders.

40|$|Wage or {{employment}} subsidies {{have been used}} in both developed and developing countries to raise <b>employment</b> levels. Various <b>advisers</b> to the South African government have endorsed wage subsidies as a policy measure to deal with this country’s massive unemployment problem. This paper takes stock of the international literature and conducts an economywide macro-micro analysis to obtain insights into wage subsidy design and implementation issues facing developing countries. It also investigates whether this policy measure is appropriate in dealing with South Africa’s particular sources of unemployment. We argue that although wage subsidies may be successful at creating jobs in South Africa, they should not be seen as the primary or dominant policy instrument for dealing with the broader unemployment problem. To enhance the effectiveness of wage subsidies, they should preferably be linked to structured workplace training, be targeted to industries where employment will be responsive to changes in labor costs, and be focused on the youth. In the long run, addressing unemployment in South Africa requires policies that improve economic growth and the economy’s employment absorption capacity, that raise skills of new labor market entrants, that reduce labor market rigidities, and that promote effective job search, especially among the youth. ...|$|R
40|$|In its Iran-Contra investigation, Congress faced legal {{challenges}} which evolved logically from the two-century {{long history of}} Congressional investigations, {{and yet at the}} same time were unmatched in their significance. One challenge concerned 2 ̆ 2 use 2 ̆ 2 immunity, and its <b>employment</b> when high <b>advisers</b> to the President faced parallel Congressional and criminal proceedings. A second concerned the investigation of a secret international 2 ̆ 2 Enterprise, 2 ̆ 2 which, like similar enterprises, was established overseas to carry on international operations without public accountability, and was protected by multiple layers of secrecy sanctioned by law. This article addresses how history brought Congress to those challenges, and how Congress met them, because they are the two major legal obstacles to contemporary Congressional investigations. Part One begins with a discussion of factors influencing the timing of congressional investigations and the conflict between such investigations and parallel or subsequent criminal investigations and prosecutions. It then analyzes key developments in the law of immunity since Watergate. Next, this part reviews the employment of use immunity in the Watergate and Iran-Contra congressional investigations. After a general treatment of the employment of use immunity in those investigations, the article considers two types of problems with the use of the federal immunity statute: first, significant interpretive problems under the statute and second, problems in enforcing immunity orders. Part Two begins with a survey of the expanding use of international enterprises whose operations are deliberately concealed from United States executive and congressional authorities by a web of foreign secrecy laws. As an example of such concealment, it then describes the legal artifices used to create and hide the North-Secord Enterprise and the operation of that Enterprise in the Iran-Contra Affair. Next, Part Two considers the strengths and weaknesses of the three basic legal tools available to the United States in investigating such enterprises: treaties, compelled confidentiality waivers, and compelled or negotiated transfer of information through immunization or other means. It analyzes the use of these tools in the Iran-Contra investigation. Part Two then considers the overseas reach of United States process for individual and corporate evidence, the barriers created by bank secrecy laws, and techniques of international investigation...|$|R
