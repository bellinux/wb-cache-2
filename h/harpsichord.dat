5|$|To {{maximise}} his {{possibilities for}} work {{early on in}} his career, he included in his repertoire not only the regular baroque repertoire, but also modern <b>harpsichord</b> concertos including Roberto Gerhard's concerto for <b>harpsichord,</b> percussion and strings, Manuel de Falla's concerto for <b>harpsichord,</b> Frank Martin's Petite symphonie concertante for harp, <b>harpsichord,</b> piano and double string orchestra and Francis Poulenc's Concert Champêtre. Pinnock and Maxim Vengerov toured together in 2000, with Vengerov taking up the baroque violin {{for the first time}} and Pinnock taking up the modern grand piano. These concerts consisted of a first half of <b>harpsichord</b> and baroque violin, followed by a second half of piano and modern violin.|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} for The Fairy-Queen {{consists of}} two recorders, two oboes, two trumpets, timpani, string instruments and <b>harpsichord</b> continuo.|$|E

50|$|His <b>harpsichords</b> {{drew on the}} Flemish tradition, {{dominated}} by Ruckers, whose <b>harpsichords</b> had become extremely prized in the 18th century; he himself owned and hired out two Ruckers <b>harpsichords.</b> The usual specifications for his single-manual <b>harpsichords</b> was 8' 8' or 8' 8' 4' and for his double-manual <b>harpsichords</b> 8' 8' 4' and lute stop. Most from c.1760 also had a buff stop, occasionally operated by a pedal.|$|R

50|$|Bach also {{composed}} a concerto for two <b>harpsichords</b> without orchestral accompaniment, BWV 1061a, {{which is the}} early version of the concerto for two <b>harpsichords</b> and string orchestra, BWV 1061.|$|R
5|$|As a harpsichordist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be {{impossible}} to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard <b>Harpsichord</b> Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo <b>harpsichord</b> debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E
5|$|During the hiatus in Brussels, Wolfgang {{turned his}} {{attention}} briefly from performing to composing. On 14 October he finished an Allegro for <b>harpsichord,</b> which would later {{be incorporated into the}} C major sonata, K. 6, which he completed in Paris.|$|E
5|$|He {{conducted}} Opera Australia and Michael Chance in Handel's Rinaldo at the Sydney Opera House in 2005. He {{also played}} William Babell's virtuoso <b>harpsichord</b> transcriptions {{with some of}} the arias (which Babell claimed were of Handel's actual improvisations).|$|E
50|$|Other {{extraordinary}} keyboards {{include a}} Neapolitan virginal (ca. 1520), three 17th-century Flemish <b>harpsichords</b> (two by Andreas Ruckers), 17th- and 18th-century English, German, Portuguese, and French <b>harpsichords,</b> and German and Swedish clavichords.|$|R
50|$|Charles Burney {{preferred}} {{the tone of}} Shudi's <b>harpsichords</b> to Kirkman’s and his instruments were highly valued; his customers included Frederick the Great, Empress Maria Theresa, Joseph Haydn, Muzio Clementi, the Prince of Wales, Thomas Gainsborough, and George Frideric Handel. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart tried one of his <b>harpsichords</b> in 1765. His instruments were exported as far as Russia, Oporto and Naples (where one of his <b>harpsichords</b> was, according to Burney, regarded as a 'musical phenomenon').|$|R
50|$|He made {{single and}} double manual <b>harpsichords,</b> {{generally}} with a compass of five octaves (sometimes slightly less) {{and the common}} three registers; two 8' and one 4'. He decorated the soundboards with flowers and carved his initials into the rose. Dulcken's <b>harpsichords</b> are a development of Ruckers designs and have a larger range. His <b>harpsichords</b> have often served as models for modern reproductions by Martin Skowroneck and others. His surviving instruments are in collections {{around the world and}} all date from the mid-18th century.|$|R
5|$|The English Concert's London debut {{was at the}} English Bach Festival in 1973. In 1975, Pinnock {{played the}} <b>harpsichord</b> in the first ever {{performance}} of Rameau's last opera, Les Boréades, under John Eliot Gardiner.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in 1777, Kościuszko {{composed}} a polonaise and scored it for the <b>harpsichord.</b> Named for him, and with lyrics by Rajnold Suchodolski, it later became popular with Polish patriots during the November 1830 Uprising. Around that time, Kościuszko was assigned a black orderly, Agrippa Hull, whom he would treat as an equal and a friend.|$|E
5|$|The Flute King: Music {{from the}} court of Frederick the Great. Featuring Emmanuel Pahud on flute.

50|$|The film is also {{notable for}} its unusual score by renowned Hollywood film and TV {{composer}} Henry Mancini. The music was arranged for synthesiser, 12 woodwinds, organ, two pianos and two <b>harpsichords,</b> and Mancini achieved an unsettling effect by {{having one of}} the <b>harpsichords</b> tuned a quarter-tone flat.|$|R

5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes <b>harpsichord,</b> xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life from his point of view.|$|E
5|$|As the Mozarts {{began to}} be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often {{required}} to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activityat {{the end of their}} first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with scarlet fever, and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success. On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the <b>harpsichord</b> and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the <b>harpsichord.</b> Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E

5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace {{is represented by the}} strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by <b>harpsichord</b> and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E
5|$|On Late Registration, West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} different genres, including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, <b>harpsichord,</b> Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{the organ}} before {{electricity}} required {{at least one}} person to operate the bellows. When signaled by the organist, a calcant would operate a set of bellows, supplying the organ with air. Because calcants were expensive, organists would usually practise on other instruments such as the clavichord or <b>harpsichord.</b> By the mid-19th-century bellows were also being operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s bellows were gradually replaced by wind turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have electric blowers, although others can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored in one or more regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the windchests until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.|$|E

5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the <b>harpsichord,</b> organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey through}} Switzerland continued, with concerts at Lausanne and Zurich. Since leaving the Netherlands, Wolfgang had {{composed}} little; a minor <b>harpsichord</b> piece, K. 33B, {{written for the}} Zürich concerts, and later some cello pieces (since lost) written for the Prince of Fürstenberg. The prince received the party on 20 October, on its arrival in Donaueschingen on the German border, for a stay of some 12 days. Resuming their journey, they reached Munich on 8 November. They were delayed here for nearly two weeks after Wolfgang fell ill, but he was well enough to perform before the Elector, with Nannerl, on 22 November. A few days later they set out for Salzburg, arriving at their home on the Getreidegasse on 29 November 1766.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a <b>harpsichord</b> almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
