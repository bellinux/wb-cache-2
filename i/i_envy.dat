25|$|I {{see people}} who write {{characters}} who are loonies and make them convincing and believable, and <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> them tremendously. I don’t really understand them. It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s a very strange place for somebody who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|E
500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles I {{became the}} English monarch in 1625, and the {{situation}} grew worse for Puritans; an increased number of them moved to the Netherlands. [...] Charles tended to be inflexible, {{but he would not}} compromise with his rivals. [...] This resulted in Parliament becoming dominated by Puritans, followed by civil war in the 1640s. [...] Under Charles, the Anglican church reverted to more ceremonial worship, approaching that of Catholicism, and there was increased hostility towards the Calvinism that Cotton followed. [...] Cotton's colleagues were being summoned to the High Court for their Puritan practices, but he continued to thrive because of his supportive aldermen and sympathetic superiors, as well as his conciliatory demeanor. [...] Minister Samuel Ward of Ipswich remarked, [...] "Of all men in the world <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> Mr. Cotton, of Boston, most; for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I do everything that way, and cannot enjoy mine." ...|$|E

If I could a got him by the scuff of the neck, I'd a treated him jist like any wermin;--I would, indeed! He was wermin! I ollays said it. I hated him ollays! I did indeed, Mr John, from the first moment when {{he used to be}} nigging away at them foutry balls, {{knocking}} them in among the rhododendrons, as though there weren't no flower blossoms for next year. He never looked at one as though one were a Christian; did he, Mr John?" ...|$|R

500|$|Although some British {{thought that}} Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby {{retained}} him in command. However he overrode Chauvel's own preference {{to appoint a}} Royal Horse Guards officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as [...] "Wombat", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A [...] "brass-bound brigadier" [...] was quoted as saying, [...] "Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian." [...] On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, [...] "I cannot say how much <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it is my own trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise." [...] At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's [...] "arms length" [...] style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|They {{worked all}} summer and autumn, with a {{successful}} opening on 7 December 1889. [...] Press accounts were almost entirely favourable, and the opera enjoyed a run {{longer than any}} of their other joint works except for H.M.S. Pinafore, Patience and The Mikado. Sullivan's old collaborator on Cox and Box (and the editor of Punch), F. C. Burnand, wrote, [...] "Magnificento! ... <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{writes about}} the [...] "wonderful" [...] Third Reich and a man named [...] "Hitler." [...] At first Max is covetous: [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> you! ... You go to a {{democratic}} Germany, a land with a deep culture and {{the beginnings of a}} fine political freedom." [...] Max soon however has misgivings about his friend's new enthusiasms, having heard from eyewitnesses who had gotten out of Berlin that Jews were being beaten and their businesses boycotted. Martin responds, telling Max that, while they may be good friends, everybody knows that Jews have been the universal scapegoats, and [...] "a few must suffer for the millions to be saved." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "From {{more than}} hundred goals that I scored I'm sure that over 50 were {{assisted}} by Michael. To {{play with him}} was extremely easy. We found each other by intuition {{on the field and}} found common football language. Look at Ivan Zamorano. Laudrup went there (Real) and Zamorano is a goalscorer. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> Ivan for the passes he receives. Passes on foot after you accelerated. Few people understand football like the Danish player. He can only be comprised with Maradona, Schuster or Roberto Baggio. They make things easy and find the right solutions. For them is simple, for the opponent– unthinkable. Phenomenal! His only problem is his character. He is emotional and terribly reserved. This affects him a lot, because he takes everything personally– no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree. His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he couldn't take the critics. I listen to him but I don't care that much. For Michael this was fatal. He couldn't take it anymore so he left without a word." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones <b>I</b> <b>envy</b> about this thing are the ones who are dead." [...] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, [...] "Whether it is good or bad, don't blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else." ...|$|E
