5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to <b>disregard</b> the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to <b>disregard</b> the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E

Fortunately these <b>disregards</b> were subsequently repealed.|$|R

5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills.

5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania.

5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a <b>disregard</b> for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to stripping al-Azhar of {{its status as}} congregational mosque, Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which {{the names of the}} Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed.

5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church.

5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination.
