With that single, the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be." [...] Lindsay ensured that the clips for both sides of the single were broadcast on the Raiders' television show, Where the Action Is.|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me as they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E

500|$|When it {{came time}} to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had {{received}} a part in Sean Cunningham's Manny's Orphans, arrived to read for the character of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Ari and said, [...] "You're the right size, you've got it." [...] In the original Friday the 13th, Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in Jason Takes Manhattan and Spencer Stump in Freddy vs. Jason. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen. The most well-known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.|$|E
500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and {{for him as a}} rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E

At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that {{they already had}} shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going {{on a blind date}} with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. [...] "They <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me and said, 'Go for it,'" [...] Wessler told The Hollywood Reporter. [...] "It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional." [...] Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on.

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were {{announced}} {{as having been}} cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring [...] "a funny yet heartfelt side" [...] with [...] "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." [...] Bateman described his character as [...] "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," [...] remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: [...] "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me like I was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'" ...|$|E

Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The part of Bill {{was handed}} over to Harry Crosby, son of Bing Crosby. Robbi Morgan, who plays Annie, was not auditioning for the film when she was offered the role. While in her office, Hughes <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Morgan and proclaimed [...] "you're a camp counselor". The next day Morgan was on the set. [...] Morgan only {{appeared}} on-set for a day to shoot all her scenes. Rex Everhart, who portrays Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, {{so she had to}} either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis—Savini's assistant—who would sit in the truck with her. It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on Friday the 13th. After recently being written off the show Love of Life, Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an assistant director for Friday the 13th, Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirwan {{shouldered}} {{much of the}} songwriting responsibility {{during this}} troubled and uncertain period for the band, through the changes in both the line-up and in musical style. The pressure showed in his health and he suffered problems with alcoholism; stories abound of Kirwan not eating for several days at a time, subsisting largely on beer. [...] He gradually became estranged from the other band members, and things {{came to a head}} during the autumn of 1972. Before a concert on that year's US tour, Kirwan and Welch rowed over tuning and Kirwan flew into a rage, banging his head and fists against the wall, then smashing his Gibson Les Paul guitar and refused to go onstage. Instead he watched {{while the rest of the}} band struggled through without him, and offered unwelcome criticism afterwards. Kirwan was sacked by Fleetwood, who had hitherto been the only other member still speaking to him. Fleetwood later said: [...] "It was a torment for him, really, to be up there, and it reduced him to someone who you <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and thought 'My God'. It was more a thing of, although he was asked to leave, the way I was looking at it was, I hoped, it was almost putting him out of his agony." [...] He later commented, [...] "I don't think he's ever forgiven me really." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "You Give Good Love" [...] brought Houston {{a bit of}} notoriety when {{it turned}} up among several songs cited by advice {{columnist}} Ann Landers as having suggestive titles. Landers, in her column for a reader who worried about the bad influence of song lyrics on children, wrote that [...] "Some of the lyrics are sexually provocative. The titles tell the story," [...] and called the song [...] "pretty trashy stuff", citing the song's title as an instance along with [...] "Hot Love" [...] by Cheap Trick, [...] "Let's Go to Bed" [...] by The Cure, [...] "Ready, Willing and Able" [...] by Lita Ford, [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] and [...] "Love at First Feel" [...] by AC/DC, [...] "Tease Me" [...] by Junie Morrison, and [...] "Fire Down Below" [...] by Bob Seger. Houston, {{in an interview with}} Chicago Tribune, gave some answers to Landers' comments, saying [...] "She chose a few songs out of the Top 40 that she thought had suggestive titles as far as she was concerned, {{and it was one of}} them. I don't think that the title is suggestive at all. It didn't say anything but 'you give good love,' and it didn't say anything in the song that was sexual or outrageous. I think that Miss Landers <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the title and didn't view the song itself." [...] Houston, who described herself as a religious person, said that she hasn't given much thought to the controversy over questionable lyrics: ...|$|E
