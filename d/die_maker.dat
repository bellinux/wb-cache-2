5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French <b>die</b> <b>maker</b> called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight, one being an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789.|$|E

25|$|Jo-Han was a {{manufacturer}} of plastic scale promotional model cars and kits originally based in Detroit. The company was founded in 1947 by tool and <b>die</b> <b>maker</b> John Hanley a year before West Gallogly's competing company AMT was formed and {{about the same time}} as PMC. After changing ownership a few times, Jo-Han models were sporadically manufactured by Okey Spaulding in Covington, KY, but apparently none have been offered for several years.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{computing}} in the manufacturing fields (including CNC, CAD, CAM, and other computer-aided technologies), tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> have increasingly added IT skills to their daily work. Today's tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> are generally required {{to have all of}} the traditional skills plus substantial digital skills; these formidable requirements make the field challenging to master.|$|R

500|$|Balabushka took Spain up on {{his offer}} after seeing {{the quality of his}} splices. Buying from Spain also had the {{advantage}} {{that he was able to}} have Spain customize the blanks to his specifications. During this period Balabushka began incorporating more elaborate details into his cues, including the eponymous Bushka rings innovation. Many later cuemakers would install Bushka rings both above the wrap and on the butt sleeve below the wrap. Balabushka used them only above the wrap, which is believed to have aided him in keeping the [...] higher on the cue. In 1970, Spain sold his cue business to tool and <b>die</b> <b>maker</b> John Davis, who had been assisting Spain for a number of years. Balabushka continued buying blanks from Davis until 1971.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{die casting}} {{industry}} has an imperative {{need for an}} automated or semi-automated approach for die casting die design. One of the key challenges that <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> face is how to shorten the lead-time to the market and reduce the cost in die design and manufacturing. Most <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> have employed computer aided design (CAD) systems to improve the e¤ciency and quality of die design. However, conventional CAD systems {{do not have the}} functionality specially for the die casting die design, therefore, a speci®c computer aided system for die casting die design is needed to meet the market demand. This paper describes a prototype system structured by several functional modules as speci®c add-on applications on a commercial CAD system for die casting die design. These modules include data initialization, cavity layout, gating system design, die-base, parting, standard component design, etc. Focus of the development will be placed on gating, runner and die-base design...|$|R

50|$|The {{jig grinder}} {{is very similar}} to a jig borer, in that the table {{positioning}} and spindles are very accurate (far more so than a manual milling machine or lathe). It is almost exclusively used by tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> in the creation of jigs or mating holes and pegs on dies. There are usually many peripheral elements to a large jig grinder, including separate hydraulic motors, air compressors, and various cooling systems for both the hydraulic circuit and supplying coolant to the work and machine itself.|$|R
50|$|Tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> work {{primarily}} in toolroom environments—sometimes literally {{in one room}} but more often in an environment with flexible, semipermeable boundaries from production work. They are skilled artisans (craftspeople) who typically learn their trade {{through a combination of}} academic coursework and hands-on instruction, with a substantial period of on-the-job training that is functionally an apprenticeship (although usually not nominally today). Art and science (specifically, applied science) are thoroughly intermixed in their work, as they also are in engineering. Manufacturing engineers and tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers</b> often work in close consultation as part of a manufacturing engineering team. There is often turnover between the careers, as one person may end up working in both at different times of their life, depending on the turns of their particular educational and career path. (In fact, there was no codified difference between them during the 19th century; it was only after World War II that engineering became a regulated profession exclusively defined by a university or college engineering degree.) Both careers require some level of talent in both artistic/artisanal/creative areas and math-and-science areas. Job-shop machinists can be any combination of toolmaker and production machinist. Some work only as machine operators, whereas others switch fluidly between toolroom tasks and production tasks.|$|R
5000|$|GM {{was also}} {{believed}} to be the employer of the UAW’s “largest single bloc of potential members and the key to union revival." [...] Reuther decided to use both the strength and growth of the industry to the union's advantage. Reuther organized tool and <b>die</b> <b>makers,</b> representing the skilled workers GM relied on in production of the 1940 models. Skilled workers were particularly loyal to the CIO and UAW due to the onset of the Great Depression and they often viewed these unions as a way to protect the integrity of their craft.|$|R
