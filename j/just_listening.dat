500|$|Branch's {{music has}} gained {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of its use during the 2012 Republican presidential primary. When she was performing [...] "I Am America" [...] at events across the country, Herman Cain was often the keynote speaker. Branch and her husband came to appreciate his political views and her husband signed on with Cain's campaign. [...] "I Am America" [...] was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme. Cain said when interviewed about the song, [...] "The first time I heard that song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps <b>just</b> <b>listening</b> to it." [...] The song was later described by the National Journal as having [...] "underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal" [...] with its lyrics. Campaign ads featuring [...] "I Am America" [...] gave the song increased exposure. A campaign ad using [...] "I Am America" [...] that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song. On The Colbert Report, comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line [...] "I Am America" [...] from Colbert's book, I Am America (And So Can You!). Several parodies of the ad were then shown on the program using the song.|$|E

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E

His doctors advised a sea voyage and [...] "a complete separation from the cares and responsibilities that must beset him at home." [...] He sailed for Europe and immediately found relief. During two months in Paris in the spring of 1857, he renewed friendships, especially with Thomas Gold Appleton, dined out frequently, and attended the opera several nights in a row. His contacts there included Alexis de Tocqueville, poet Alphonse de Lamartine, former French Prime Minister François Guizot, Ivan Turgenev, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Sumner then toured several countries, including Germany and Scotland, before returning to Washington where he spent only a few days in the Senate in December.

So I'll go on about Ben. He's our friend. Why, Wilson, that sweetness, softness, gentleness about him, the heart that makes him love us, that must be only the woman in him. I don't know what a mother would feel like, but I do know that I seem strangely happier since I've confessed my troubles to this man. It was Lem who told me how Ben offered to be a friend to Jack. And Jack flouted him. I've a queer notion that the moment Jack did this he turned his back on a better life.|$|E

I was mighty sorry for the chief. He had just thrown his life away, and it must come to the same in the end, as far as I was concerned. Even now he could get away if he chose, but I knew well enough it weren't any good talking to him. So I lay there, <b>just</b> <b>listening</b> for the crack of his rifle above. He would bring down the first man that came in, sartin, and there would be plenty of time after that to get me up beside him, for they would be sure to have a long talk before they made any move. I did not expect them until late in the afternoon, and hoped it might be getting dark before they got down into the valley. There had been a big wind sweeping down it since the snow had fallen, and though it had drifted deep along the sides, the bottom was for the most part bare. I noticed that the chief had picked his way carefully, and guessed that, as they would have no reason for thinking we were near, they might not take up the trail till morning. Of course they would find our fire and the dead bear, or all that there was left of him, and they would fancy we had only stopped to take a meal and had gone on again. They would see by the fire that we had left pretty early in the day. I heard nothing of the chief until it began to get dark; then he came down to me.|$|E
