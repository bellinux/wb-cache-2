5|$|Liquid <b>fluorocarbons</b> {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have {{attracted}} attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because <b>fluorocarbons</b> do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., <b>fluorocarbons,</b> hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied <b>fluorocarbons,</b> which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluorocarbon</b> {{compounds}} {{have potential}} value as hydrologic tracers. The compounds are easily detectable in small amounts, and background hydrologic concentrations are usually small. This thesis documents soil column studies which {{were designed to}} test the mobility of <b>fluorocarbon</b> compounds in a controlled saturated flow regime. The <b>fluorocarbon</b> compounds were passed, in aqueous solutions, through columns filled with Ottowa sand, Yolo sandy loam, and crushed coal. Salt tracers were used as control substances. The <b>fluorocarbon</b> tracer effluent concentrations were compared to the salt tracer effluent concentrations so that relative tracer mobilities could be analyzed. In all tests, the <b>fluorocarbon</b> tracers exhibited delayed breakthrough characteristics. Delays were least in the Ottowa sand, significant in the Yolo sandy loam, and severe in the crushed coal. Longitudinal dispersion coefficients (D(L)) were calculated for the various tests. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> tracer D(L) values averaged 3. 9 {{times higher than the}} salt tracer D(L) values. Distribution coefficient analysis yielded <b>fluorocarbon</b> tracer values that averaged 8. 0 times the salt tracer values. Nonspecific electrical phenomena probably caused the <b>fluorocarbon</b> tracer delays, and related parameters such as polarizability and aqueous solubility are speculated to be predictive parameters for qualitatively determining <b>fluorocarbon</b> delay times...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is a {{very common}} and serious problem which has a harmful impact on the economy {{development}} of the country. Among others the application of organic paints is the most economical and efficient way to protect engineering structures from corrosion. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> paint {{is one of the}} most widely used resins for anticorrosion application due to its excellent corrosion resistance, chemical resistance,and weatherability. However, <b>fluorocarbon</b> paint also has some disadvantages restricting its application in some fields, so it is necessary to modify the <b>fluorocarbon</b> paint. In this article,the development history and application of the <b>fluorocarbon</b> paint were systematically summarized.

The evolution of the microscopic structure of the <b>fluorocarbon</b> layer along the normal-to-surface was measured in situ using X-ray reflectivity.

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous <b>fluorocarbons,</b> sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E

It indicates that air permeability/breathability of treated cotton fabric {{was closer to}} untreated cotton. However, at 50 to 60  g/L of <b>fluorocarbon,</b> little deterioration was observed. This further shows that no continuous film of <b>fluorocarbon</b> polymer was formed and porosity of fabric was sustained.|$|R
40|$|For various <b>fluorocarbon</b> {{processing}} chemistries in an {{inductively coupled plasma}} reactor, we {{have observed}} relatively thick (2 – 7 nm) <b>fluorocarbon</b> layers that exist on the surface during steady state etching of silicon. In steady state, the etch rate and the surface modifications of silicon do not change {{as a function of}} time. The surface modifications were characterized by in situ ellipsometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The contribution of direct ion impact on the silicon substrate to the etching mechanism is reduced with increasing <b>fluorocarbon</b> layer thickness. Therefore, we consider that the silicon etch rate is controlled by a neutral etchant flux through the layer. Our experimental data show, however, that ions play an import role in the transport of silicon etching precursors through the layer. A model is developed that describes the etch kinetics through a <b>fluorocarbon</b> layer based on a fluorine diffusion transport mechanism. The model is consistent with the data when {{one or two of the}} following roles of the ions on the etching process are assumed. The first role is an enhancement in the diffusivity of fluorine atoms through the <b>fluorocarbon</b> layer and an enhancement in the reaction probability of fluorine in the <b>fluorocarbon</b> layer. In this case the fluorine is assumed to originate from the gas phase. The second role includes ion fragmentation and dissociation of the <b>fluorocarbon</b> surface molecules. © 1998 American Vacuum Society...|$|R

40|$|Anchorage-dependent {{fibroblasts}} can be cultured {{by using}} {{as a substrate}} the protein layer that spontaneously forms at the liquid-liquid interface between <b>fluorocarbon</b> fluids and tissue culture medium. For this novel substrate {{to be effective in}} supporting confluent cell layers, the protein monolayer must support the stresses exerted by spreading fibroblasts. The composition of the <b>fluorocarbon</b> fluid has a significant effect on the strength of the protein layer and, thus, on the patterns of cell growth. Evidence is presented demonstrating that a protein film, sufficiently strong to support cell growth, does not occur on purified <b>fluorocarbon</b> fluids but requires the presence of trace amounts of polar, surface active compounds. By the addition of small quantities of pentafluorobenzoyl chloride to alumina-treated <b>fluorocarbon</b> fluids, excellent interfacial substrates can be produced. We have applied this understanding to produce a liquid microcarrier system capable of general use with a variety of cells, including human fibroblasts.

He then worked on pilot plant tests for the enrichment of uranium-235. Finally, Eicher spent two years along with colleague Albert L.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{selective etching}} of a SiO 2 layer over a Si or Si 3 N 4 underlayer, {{a process of}} vital importance to modern integrated circuit fabrication technology, has been studied. Selective etching of SiO 2 -to-Si 3 N 4 in various inductively coupled <b>fluorocarbon</b> plasmas (CHF 3, C 2 F 6 /C 3 F 6, and C 3 F 6 /H 2) was performed, and the results compared to selective SiO 2 -to-Si etching. A <b>fluorocarbon</b> film is present on the surfaces of all investigated substrate materials during steady state etching conditions.

40|$|Separation {{selectivity}} in electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) {{is directly}} affected by the chemistry and solvent characteristics of the pseudostationary phase (PSP). The chemical selectivity of micellar PSPs has been previously demonstrated to vary significantly between anionic and cationic surfactants {{as well as between}} hydrocarbon and <b>fluorocarbon</b> surfactants. Polymeric PSPs have also been demonstrated to provide unique selectivity. In the current study, four cationic polymeric pseudo-stationary phases, two of which have perfluorinated pendant groups, are introduced and characterized as PSPs in EKC. Their performance and selectivity is compared to conventional micellar PSPs with similar structure. The solvation characteristics and selectivity of the four polymers most closely resemble those observed for cationic micelles. The polymers are all more cohesive and more polar than their hydrocarbon micellar counterparts. The <b>fluorocarbon</b> PSPs did show preferential interaction with <b>fluorocarbon</b> solutes, were somewhat more cohesive, and were stronger hydrogen bond donors. However, the presence of <b>fluorocarbon</b> moieties did not have as dramatic an effect on selectivity as was observed and published previously for <b>fluorocarbon</b> micelles. This may result from the selectivity being dominated by the presence of the cationic head groups or from the <b>fluorocarbon</b> character of the pendant groups being moderated by the presence of hydrocarbon functionality on the polymer back-bones.

25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, <b>fluorocarbons,</b> and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E
500|$|Glide waxes {{enhance the}} speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then {{polishing}} the ski bottom. [...] Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost. [...] Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on paraffin are common for recreational use. [...] Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays. [...] <b>Fluorocarbons</b> decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions.
