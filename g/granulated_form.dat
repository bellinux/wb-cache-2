25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a <b>granulated</b> <b>form</b> that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E

40|$|Quinoline Yellow {{is applied}} as a {{colourant}} to add colour to feedingstuffs for non food-producing animals at the maximum dose of 500 mg/kg feed. In {{the absence of}} specific data, the safe feed concentration for non food-producing animals could be derived from an established no observed adverse effect level of a chronic rat study applying a safety factor of 100. The resulting maximum safe concentration was calculated for dogs and cats and was extrapolated to other non food-producing animals. The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals. Since no information regarding dusting potential was available, it would be prudent to regard both the powder and the <b>granulated</b> <b>forms</b> as hazardous if inhaled.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{electron}} radiation on physicochemical properties of pristine poly(lactic acid) (PLA), or polylactide, and of polylactide containing a selected crosslinking agent. Design/methodology/approach: Samples to be examined were prepared in <b>granulated</b> <b>forms</b> or as moulded pieces and then treated with the high-energy electron radiation (ca. 10 MeV). The methods of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), rheology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) were used to determine physicochemical properties of the samples. A humidity sensor was utilised to determine water vapour permeability. Findings: It has been found that PLA undergoes degradation upon the electron radiation. Triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) when introduced into polylactide causes plasticization of this polymer whereas irradiation of polylactide containing TAIC leads to crosslinking of PLA. Crosslinked PLA exhibits limited plastic flow or no flow at all and an elevated glass transition temperature. Water vapour permeability of a film made of PLA modified this way is much less than that of a film produced from original PLA. Research limitations/implications: Further studies of crosslinked PLA are advisable, especially assessment of the gelation degree, strength of the plasticized material, and biodegradation. Practical implications: Crosslinked PLA may be applied in practical processes, especially in thermoforming in which increased resistance of a material against deformation at elevated temperatures is required. Originality/value: Substantial influence of the electron radiation on properties of PLA was established. The material undergoes significant degradation upon even relatively small radiation doses. In order to crosslink PLA, TAIC in the amount of ca. 3 wt% and the electron radiation doses of up to ca. 60 kGy have to be applied...|$|R
40|$|Specialized natural killer (NK) {{lymphocytes}} are {{a feature}} of the pregnant uterus in humans and rodents. Conceptus-medi-ated recruitment of uterine (u) NK cells in the pig was proposed based on evidence that elevated uNK activity was temporally associated with increased leukocyte density in endometrium un-derlying conceptuses. The objective {{of this study was to}} deter-mine whether uNK cells were more abundant at embryonic at-tachment sites during the early postattachment period. Mono-nuclear leukocytes were isolated from endometrium at attach-ment sites versus between attachment sites, and expression of CD 16, a marker for NK cells, was assessed by flow cytometry. CD 16 binding was normalized to leukocyte numbers in each sample. CD 161 small lymphocytes were more frequent in uter-us than in blood (41 % 6 2 % versus 26 % 6 4 %). Differences between pregnant and luteal phase uterus (43 % 6 2 % versus 31 % 6 7 %, respectively) were not statistically significant. In pregnant animals, CD 161 lymphocytes were slightly but signif-icantly more abundant in uterus at attachment sites versus be-tween attachment sites at Days 15 – 17, 21 – 22, and 25 – 28. Be-fore normalization, CD 161 large, granular cells were more abundant at attachment sites versus between attachment sites; however, these differences were removed when data were nor-malized according to leukocyte numbers. Further characteriza-tion showed that the proportion of large granular leukocytes expressing CD 8, reactive with NK cells and T cell subsets, was 2 -fold higher in pregnant uterus than in maternal blood. These results raise the possibility that uNK cells resembling those in blood may be transformed into larger, more <b>granulated</b> <b>forms</b> in the uterine microenvironment. immunology, implantation, pregnancy, trophoblast, uteru...|$|R

40|$|Common ceramic {{component}} manufacturing typically {{involves the}} processing of the raw materials in powder <b>form.</b> <b>Granulated</b> powder is <b>formed</b> into a green body of the desired size and shape by consolidation, often by simply pressing nominally dry powder. Ceramic powders are commonly pressed in steel dies or rubber bags {{with the aim of}} producing a near-net-shape green body for subsequent sintering. Density gradients in these compacts, introduced during the pressing operation, are often severe enough to cause distortions {{in the shape of the}} part during sintering due to nonuniform shrinkage. In such cases, green machining or diamond grinding operations may be needed to obtain the desired final shape and size part. In severe cases, nonuniform shrinkage may even cause fracture in the parts during sintering. Likewise, density gradients can result in green bodies that break during ejection from the die or that are too fragile to be handled during subsequent processing. Empirical relationships currently exist to describe powder compaction but provide little understanding of how to control die design or compaction parameters to minimize density gradients thereby forcing the designer to use expensive and time consuming trial and error procedures. For this reason, interest has grown in developing computational tools to address this problem (Aydin et al., 1996 and Coube, 1998). The goal of the present work was to develop a general continuum-based finite element model for ceramic powder compaction that can be used to aid and guide the design and pressing of ceramic powders. Such a model can be used to improve both part and die/bag pressing design, resulting in more efficient and cost effective ways to make better parts...|$|R
