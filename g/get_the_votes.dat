If the voter turnout is less than 50%, the candidate is declared a winner only if they <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> of at least 1/3 of all eligible voters. If {{there are more than}} two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held on a Sunday no more than two weeks after the first round. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting and the candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner. If two or fewer candidates stand for election and none manage to win in the first round, a new election is held no more than three months after the election date.|$|E

500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were the Have-Nots for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an over-sized face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E
2500|$|Following Carol's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests were asked a series of {{questions}} about which of two HouseGuests would adhere to certain situations. The object was not to base the answer on personal opinions, but how they thought the majority would answer. The minority of the voters were eliminated each round; if there was a tie, none of the HouseGuests would be eliminated. Jen was the winner of the competition. On Day 14, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Name That Pie" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests split into two teams and would bid on how many bites it would take to identify the two ingredients in a pie. If a player correctly identified the pie, they win a point for the team, but if they were unable to identify the pie, they would win a point for the opposing team; the first team to seven points would be the winner. The competition resulted in Amber, Daniele, Jameka, Jessica, Joe, and Kail being on slop for the week. That same day, Jen chose to nominate Daniele and Dick for eviction, claiming {{that the two of them}} were the most negative people in the house. On Day 15, Amber, Mike, and Joe were selected to play for the Power of Veto competition; Dustin was selected to host. Shortly before the competition, Jen made numerous statements to upset Amber, which led to numerous arguments in the house. The HouseGuests then competed in the [...] "Cutthroat Christmas" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to slide a curling stone down an icy path in an attempt to get it closest to the center; the person furthest from the center each round is eliminated. The eliminated HouseGuest from each round earns a prize, which can be taken from them at any time by another eliminated HouseGuest. Daniele was the winner of the Power of Veto for the second consecutive time. On Day 17, Daniele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Jen nominating Joe in her place. Fearing he would nominate her if he won Head of Household, Kail began attempting to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> to evict Dick from the house. Despite this, not even Kail's own alliance went along with her plan, thus ending the [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] alliance. On Day 20, Joe became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of nine to one.|$|E

50|$|The 2005 season saw Pavlich {{moved to}} centre half forward, with Fremantle {{focusing}} on a taller forward structure. The move paid massive dividends for the team, as Pavlich topped Fremantle's list of goalkickers, with 61 goals for the season. He also took more marks than any other Docker and won his second Doig Medal as Fremantle's best and fairest player. In the 2005 Brownlow Medal count, Pavlich was tipped as a contender, but like Tredrea in 2004, the power forwards did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> of the umpires and Pavlich finished equal ninth; receiving more votes than any other Fremantle player.|$|E

Rather than requesting and/or accepting personal gifts, a common practice, he made a deal with the Democratic Party in Montgomery, promising to secure the African-American vote if funding would be provided for a normal school for African Americans at Tuskegee. His skillful political negotiation, leadership and visions for the future proved successful, and funding of US$2,000 annually for a [...] "Negro Normal School in Tuskegee" [...] was made available by the state legislature beginning in 1881. (Normal schools were so named because they taught future teachers educational standards or norms.) ...|$|E

5000|$|While in the house, Boswell {{became known}} as [...] "Chicken George" [...] and [...] "The Chicken Man" [...] {{for taking care of}} the {{chickens}} in the house. George was frequently upset about things that occurred in the house, and at one point attempted to convince the HouseGuests to walk out in protest, which never happened.

When George was nominated in the eighth week, his family and hometown rallied to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> to keep him, resulting in Brittany's banishment and causing much controversy outside of the house. George was ultimately banished on Day 78, coming in fifth place. George is thus far the only HouseGuest from the first season to appear in a future installment of the series, returning to compete in Big Brother: All-Stars (2006).

On Day 39, Spencer used the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Candice being nominated in his place in an attempt to ensure Howard's eviction. Jessie and Candice, believing that Amanda and McCrae were in control of the game, attempted to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> to evict Amanda from the house, though this plan failed. As a result, Candice and Jessie became outcasts in the house, and became the targets for several HouseGuests. During week six, Candice won a $5,000 prize. GinaMarie and her allies decided to target Candice and Jessie for eviction, hoping to see Candice be evicted from the house. On Day 43, GinaMarie chose to nominate Candice and Jessie for eviction. Candice lost the Veto competition and had to wear a [...] "Clownitard" [...] for a week. They also learned that this season would feature nine Jury members, rather than seven.
