Many inmates took full advantage of this. Albert Speer, after having his official request to write his memoirs denied, finally began setting down his experiences and perspectives of his time with the Nazi regime, which were smuggled out and later released as a bestselling book, Inside the Third Reich. Dönitz wrote letters to his former deputy regarding the protection of his prestige in the outside world. When his release was near, he gave instructions to his wife on how best she could help ease his transition back into politics, which he intended, but never actually accomplished.

As the highly contaminated region has good groundwater yield, it means that greater population is vulnerable to fluorosis (WHO 2004).|$|R

40|$|As {{groundwater}} {{becomes increasingly}} important for living and environment, techniques are {{asked for an}} improved exploration. The demand {{is not only to}} detect new groundwater resources but also to protect them. Geophysical techniques are the key to find groundwater. Combination of geophysical measurements with boreholes and borehole measurements help to describe groundwater systems and their dynamics. There are a number of geophysical techniques based on the principles of geoelectrics, electromagnetics, seismics, gravity and magnetics, which are used in exploration of geological structures in particular for the purpose of discovering georesources. The special geological setting of groundwater systems, i. e. structure and material, makes it necessary to adopt and modify existing geophysical techniques. A new discipline called hydrogeophysics has been formed and is growing fast. Efforts for direct detection of groundwater led recently to a new technique: Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SNMR). The principle of nuclear magnetic resonance, well known in physics, physical chemistry as well as in medicine, has successfully been adapted to assess the existence of groundwater and the aquifer parameters. This technique allows for the first time detecting and assessing water directly by only surface measurements allowing quantitative information about mobile water content as well as pore structure parameters leading to hydraulic conductivities. Function, results, interpretation, advantages and drawbacks of SNMR are reviewed in this paper showing the current state of art and developments. A comprehensive example of SNMR is presented with measurements conducted at the site of Nauen near Berlin. The site has Quaternary aquifers with differing layering of sand and till. The results are very satisfying as aquifers down to 50 m depth can be identified quite reliably. The water content is estimated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and relaxation times allowed to derive <b>hydraulic</b> conductivities. <b>Supplementary</b> measurements with geoelectrics and radar made possible to complement and confirm the information achieved with SNMR as well as to apply a joint multimethod approach to aquifer assessment...|$|R

Owing to the thermo-rheological properties of the contrast media, the primary aim of this work is to present an in vitro experimental impact study concerning {{the impact of the}} temperature level on flushing efficiency after contrast medium injection. Moreover, we report experimental data that confirms the role of needle bevel orientation. The secondary aim is to answer the following questions: Is there significant device contrast medium trapping after contrast medium injection? Is saline flushing efficient? And, finally, is it safe to inject contrast medium through an indwelled port catheter?Results: The experimental results show that in addition to hydrodynamics, temperature is a key parameter for the efficiency of device flushing after contrast medium injection. It appears that this is the case when the cavity is incompletely rinsed after three calibrated flushing volumes of 10 mL saline solution, even by using the Huber needle bevel opposite to the port exit. This leads to a potentially important trapped volume of contrast medium in the port, and consequently to the possibility of subsequent salt precipitates and long term trisubstituted benzene nuclei delivery that might impair the solute properties, which may be further injected via the power port later on. Conclusion: We thus suggest, in TIVADS patients, the use of a temporary <b>supplementary</b> intravenous <b>line</b> rather than the port to perform contrast medium injections in daily radiology routine practice.

This thesis {{considers}} the death narrative accounts found in the Lives of these four saints, all of them monks, two of them bishops (including one archbishop), who were leaders of their respective communities. The death ritual process mandated by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury in his customary, the Monastic Constitutions, is deployed as a base text for comparison. The analysis of these texts seeks to elicit {{an understanding of how}} monastic death was to be managed in principle, and how it might have been performed and experienced in practice, in twelfth-century England. The death narratives are those of saints, and therefore hagiographical works intended to demonstrate the sanctity of their subject and his suitability as an exemplar of monastic virtue. The Lives show significant commonality in their utilisation of the death of the saint as a framework through which to describe this. There is commonality too in the areas of the death ritual that the hagiographers chose to use, and those they ignored, in their accounts. These aspects of monastic sanctity as demonstrated through the accounts of dying and death are explored in this thesis.

40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) plays {{important}} roles in the regulation of liver functions and promotes the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver cancer. Whereas protein-encoding genes are well-studied, the contribution of IL- 6 -regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) to its effects is largely unexplored. Similarly, {{little is known about}} miRNAs regulating key molecules of the IL- 6 /JAK/STAT 3 signaling pathway. In the main part of this thesis, cell-based high-throughput screenings systems were developed, allowing the identification of miRNAs interfering with the IL- 6 /JAK/STAT 3 signaling. Out of 538 miRNA mimics, this dual screening approach followed by various validation steps (luciferase- 3 ’UTR-reporter assays, western blot and flow cytometry analyses) allowed us to identify twelve miRNAs targeting STAT 3, JAK 1, SOCS 3, IL 6 R and/or gp 130, ten of them had not yet been reported as regulators of this pathway before. In the second part of this work, microarray analyses revealed that primary hepatocytes are considerably more responsive to IL- 6 stimulation regarding changes in their miRNomes than liver-derived cell lines. Despite their weaker response, one of the top regulated miRNA found in the primary hepatocytes, miR- 146 b- 5 p, could also be induced by IL- 6 -type cytokines (IL- 6 and Oncostatin M) in cell lines. Its functional role(s) in hepatocytes are currently investigated. A larger, comparative study included additionally Interferon gamma and IL- 27, cytokines with a STAT 1 -dominated response, and <b>supplementary</b> cell <b>lines</b> originating not only from the liver but also from other tissues. While all cytokines had profound effects on the mRNA transcriptomes, only very small to moderate changes were observed at the miRNome level, suggesting that the regulation mediated by cytokines mainly happens through the modulation of protein-coding genes rather than by fine-tuning via miRNAs. Additionally, we analyzed expression of a broad panel of cytokines in sera of 125 patients with liver diseases (steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, HCC) by bead-based multiplex immunoassays. We observed that, for example, serum HGF, IL- 6 and IL- 8 levels increased in relation with the severeness of liver pathology while PDGF-BB and RANTES decreased. When investigating the impact of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 variant I 148 M (PNPLA 3 I 148 M), known to be a risk factor for the development of liver diseases, on the serum levels of cytokines, no significant differences could be observed between the different genotypes. In this PhD thesis, we identified and characterized miRNAs relevant for the IL- 6 /JAK/STAT 3 signaling pathway, including miR- 146 b- 5 p as an IL- 6 -inducible miRNA. Others like miR- 194 - 5 p, miR- 4473 and miR- 548 k were demonstrated to be negative regulators of this pathway and may be of potential therapeutic significance. In addition, we showed that, while miRNAs can modulate this pathway, IL- 6 seems to rather regulate the mRNA transcriptome than the miRNome...|$|R
40|$|NGC 6334 is a galactic star-forming {{region in}} Scorpius, heavily {{obscured}} by intervening dust. The region consists of several major sites {{of star formation}} known previously from far-infrared (IR) and radio-wavelength observations. We present images of NGC 6334 obtained at wavelengths of 850 and 450 μm with the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometric Array at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data highlight the distribution of dense cold dust, a particularly striking feature {{of which is a}} narrow ridge of emission passing between most of the star-forming centers. We use a clump-finding technique to quantify the distribution of dust emission throughout the region, and we obtain estimates of the sizes, masses, and temperatures of the clump ensemble under simple assumptions. Clump masses range from a minimum detectable of about 1 M ⊙, up to almost 3000 M ⊙. We find in particular that the ridge feature is characterized by a relatively narrow range of clump parameters as compared with the rest of NGC 6334, and we obtain a clump mass spectral index that lies between N(M) ∝ M – 1. 5 and M – 1. 0 for the high-mass clumps. The total mass of dust emitting at submillimeter wavelengths is about 16700 M ⊙ for an assumed temperature of 25 K; a significant fraction of this mass is contained within the ridge feature. These data are compared with recently published observations of NGC 6334 obtained at 1. 2 mm wavelength using a direct-detection scanning technique, and with images obtained by the GLIMPSE-II and Mid-course Space Experiment missions at wavelengths from 3. 3 to 21 μm in the near IR (NIR).

40|$|The link {{suspension}} {{is the most}} prevailing suspension system for freight wagons in Central and Western Europe. The system design is simple and has existed for more than 100 years. However, still its characteristics are not fully understood. This thesis investigates the dynamic performance of freight wagons and comprises five parts: In the first part a review of freight wagon running gear is made. The different suspension systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The second part focuses on the lateral force-displacement characteristics of the {{link suspension}}. Results from stationary measurements on freight wagons and laboratory tests of the link suspension characteristics are presented. To improve the understanding of various mechanisms and phenomena in link suspension systems, a simulation model is developed. In the third part the multibody dynamic simulation model is discussed. The previous freight wagon model developed at KTH is able to explain many of the phenomena observed in tests. In some cases, however, simulated and measured running behaviour differ. Therefore, a new simulation model is presented and validated against on-track test results. The performance of standard two-axle freight wagons is investigated. The most important parameters for the running behaviour of the vehicle are the suspension characteristics. The variation in characteristics between different wagons is large due to geometrical tolerances of the components, wear, corrosion, moisture or other lubrication. The influence {{of the variation in}} suspension characteristics and other parameters on the behaviour of the wagon, on tangent track and in curves, is discussed. Finally, suggestions for improvements of the system are made. A majority of the traffic related track deterioration cost originates from freight traffic. With heavier and faster freight trains the maintenance cost is likely to increase. In the fourth part the possibility to improve ride comfort and reduce track forces on standard freight wagons with link suspension is discussed. The variation of characteristics in link suspension running gear is considerable and unfavourable conditions leading to hunting are likely to occur. Supported by on-track tests and multibody dynamic simulations, it is concluded that the running behaviour of two-axled wagons with UIC double-link suspension as well as wagons with link suspension bogies (G-type) can be improved when the running gear are equipped with <b>supplementary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> dampers. Finally in the fifth part the effects of different types of running gear and operational conditions on the track deterioration marginal cost — in terms of settlement in the ballast, component fatigue, wear and RCF — is investigated. Considerable differences in track deterioration cost per produced ton-km for the different types of running gear are observed. Axle load is an important parameter for settlement and component fatigue. Also the height of centre of gravity has significant influence on track deterioration, especially on track sections with high cant deficiency or cant excess. QC 2010080...|$|R
40|$|The link {{suspension}} {{is the most}} prevailing suspension system for freight wagons in central and western Europe. The system design is simple and has existed for more than 100 years. However, still its characteristics are not fully understood. This thesis emphasizes freight wagon dynamics and comprises three parts: In the first part a review of freight wagon running gear is made. The different suspension systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The review covers the running gear standardized by UIC and the conventional so-called three-piece bogie. Additionally five improved three-piece bogies and twelve novel running gear designs are presented. The second part focuses on the lateral force-displacement characteristics in the {{link suspension}}. Results from stationary measurements on freight wagons and laboratory tests of the link suspension characteristics are presented. To improve understanding of the various mechanisms and phenomena in link suspension systems a simulation model is developed. Link suspension systems have strongly nonlinear characteristics including a hysteresis loop. The loop exhibits usually three characteristic sections with different tangential stiffnesses. The actual contact geometry of the links and end bearings has a significant influence on the characteristics. By wear in ordinary service - {{as well as by}} geometric tolerances on new components - the contact geometry may deviate considerably from nominal geometry. Further, it seems that elastic deformation in the contact surfaces has considerable effects on the suspension characteristics, in particular on the initial rolling stiffness for small displacements. Also, flexibilities in links and end bearings influence the characteristics. It is also observed that new components after a short period of dynamic testing can exhibit a very low amount of energy dissipation, a phenomenon that is also indicated in some stationary measurements on wagons. To summarize the second part, it appears that the link suspension characteristics are very sensitive to several factors being hard to control in the real world of freight wagon operations. The various stiffnesses and hysteresis loops have a considerable variation and may have a strong influence on the ride qualities of vehicles. As long as the characteristics can not be controlled within closer limits than found in this study, there is a strong need for sensitivity analysis to be made, both in predictive multibody simulations of vehicle dynamics, as well as in verification and acceptance tests. In the third part a study on the possibility to improve ride qualities of freight wagons with link suspensions is presented. Parametric studies with multibody dynamic simulations on freight wagons equipped with link-suspension bogies are performed. The effect of <b>supplementary</b> friction and <b>hydraulic</b> damping is investigated under various running conditions: speed, loading, tangent and curved track, wheel-rail contact geometry, track gauge and track irregularities. Substantial improvements of the lateral running behaviour of wagons with link suspension bogies can be achieved - both at ordinary speeds and at increased speeds - by using a proper combination of <b>supplementary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> dampers. Speeds up to 160 km/h could be realistic...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBreast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in women worldwide. Despite the {{information}} provided by anatomopathological assessment and molecular markers (such as receptor expression ER, PR, HER 2), breast cancer therapies and prognostics depend on the metabolic properties of tumor cells. However, metabolomics have not provided a robust and congruent biomarker yet, likely because individual metabolite contents are insufficient to encapsulate all of the alterations in metabolic fluxes. Here, we took advantage of natural 13 C and 15 N isotope abundance to show there are isotopic differences between healthy and cancer biopsy tissues or between healthy and malignant cultured cell lines. Isotope mass balance further suggests that these differences are mostly related to lipid metabolism, anaplerosis and urea cycle, three pathways known to be impacted in malignant cells. Our results demonstrate that the isotope signature is a good descriptor of metabolism since it integrates modifications in C partitioning and N excretion altogether. Our present study is thus a starting point to possible clinical applications such as patient screening and biopsy characterization in every cancer that is associated with metabolic changes. Medical applications of stable isotopes are now widespread, like the well-known 13 C-urea breath assay for ulcer detection 1. This takes advantage of 13 C-labelling and thus usually neglects differences in reaction rates between isotopic forms, because the isotopic signal used for diagnosing is far above small natural variations in 13 C. By contrast, the use of isotopes at natural abundance exploits such subtle differences (referred to as isotope effects) to identify bottlenecks in metabolic pathways (rate-limiting steps) or the contribution of multiple elemental sources (mass balance), without the need to introduce expensive isotope tracers into the patient. Isotope effects in metabolism are mostly caused by enzymatic reactions that preferentially consume substrates containing either the light or the heavy isotope (isotopologues) and therefore, the natural isotope abundance in metabolites depends on metabolic fluxes and source substrates 2. For example, the natural 13 C abundance in respired CO 2 has been used to trace diet composition and substrate changes during exercise 3, 4. In cancer biology, the use of natural variations in Cu and S stable isotopes in hepatocellular carcinoma has been attempted recently 5. But to our knowledge, no study has looked at alterations of natural isotope abundance in breast cancer. Due to changes in primary C and N metabolism such as increased glycolysis, glutaminolysis and nucleotide synthesis 6, important changes in 13 C and 15 N natural abundance can be anticipated. To address this question, we examined the isotopic signature of intact breast cancer biopsies (mostly from invasive ductal carcinoma, IDC) and cultured breast cancer cell <b>lines</b> (<b>Supplementary</b> Tables S 1 and S 2) using elemental analysis coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS). This technique has been recently shown to be applicable to the biochemical analysis of cancerous cell lines 7...|$|R
40|$|Geobacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, aerobic, spore-forming obligate thermophiles. The {{descriptions}} and subsequent affiliations {{of the species}} in the genus have mostly been based on polyphasic taxonomy rules that include traditional sequence-based methods such as DNA–DNA hybridization and comparison of 16 S rRNA gene sequences. Currently, there are fifteen validly described species within the genus. The availability of whole genome sequences has provided an opportunity to validate and/or re-assess these conventional estimates of genome relatedness. We have applied whole genome approaches to estimate the phylogenetic relatedness among the sixty-three Geobacillus strains for which genome sequences are currently publicly available, including the type strains of eleven validly described species. The phylogenomic metrics AAI (Average Amino acid Identity), ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity) and dDDH (digital DNA–DNA hybridization) indicated that the current genus Geobacillus is comprised of sixteen distinct genomospecies, including several potentially novel species. Furthermore, a phylogeny constructed {{on the basis of}} the core genes identified from the whole genome analyses indicated that the genus clusters into two monophyletic clades that clearly differ in terms of nucleotide base composition. The G + C content ranges for clade I and II were 48. 8 – 53. 1 % and 42. 1 – 44. 4 %, respectively. We therefore suggest that the Geobacillus species currently residing within clade II be considered as a new genusSupplementary Figure S 1 : AAI relationships among sixty-three strains of Geobacillus.
