40|$|Compression {{tests on}} hollow sandcrete blocks are {{conventionally}} {{confined to the}} as-cast face neglecting the other two orthogonal faces. Also uniaxial compressive strength of hollow sandcrete blocks is defined {{on the basis of}} the apparent area of the as-cast face. The definition has made no distinction between hollow and solid sandcrete blocks. In other to examine/investigate the consequences of the above, two-cell hollow sandcrete blocks with 30 %, 40. 7 %, 50 % and 60 % cavity volumes were subjected to compression test on as-cast face and as-cast side. Sand/cement ratio of 6 and water/cement ratio of 0. 7 were used. The blocks were hand compacted and curing was by water sprinkling for 7 days according to Nigerian Industrial Specifications for sandcrete blocks Compressive strengths were calculated based on the apparent and effective areas of the two perpendicular surfaces. The results indicate that the effective strengths compare more favourably with the control cylinder strength than the apparent strengths. Comparison between the two perpendicular surface strengths showed a linear correlation. Therefore, the plane and smoothness of as-cast side made it a better face to define the strength of blocks by correlating it to the as-cast <b>face</b> <b>strength</b> _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

The major focus is on the innovations such as E-learning. At the same time, there is a splintering attention over sustainable research in relation to technology and implication of learning principles for education, mainly at the higher education, job training and entertainment. Taking a look towards the history of instructional technology, indicate the serge of interest by professional organizations such as universities. During the 1960 s most emphases was on the application of hardware such as audiovisual instruments. There was least attention towards research on instructional designs based on learning theories. This field saw its beginnings in instructional media (Reiser, 2002). During the last decades, we have learned that the usages of technology should be considered with the content of learning effectiveness. Instructional programs mainly audio-visual communications <b>faced</b> <b>strength</b> and weakness of pictorial messages.

No differences were observed under the upright/neutral expression condition. However, the WS group was more accurate than the autism group when discriminating upright faces with varying affective expressions, whereas the opposite pattern emerged when discriminating in-verted faces.

40|$|As {{important}} social stimuli, faces playa {{critical role in}} our lives. Much of our interaction with other people depends on our ability to recognize faces accurately. It has been proposed that face processing consists of different stages and interacts with other systems (Bruce & Young, 1986). At a perceptual level, the initial two stages, namely structural encoding and face recognition, are particularly relevant and {{are the focus of}} this dissertation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are averaged EEG signals time-locked to a particular event (such as the presentation of a face). With their excellent temporal resolution, ERPs can provide important timing information about neural processes. Previous research has identified several ERP components that are especially related to face processing, including the N 170, the P 2 and the N 250. Their nature with respect to the stages of face processing is still unclear, and is examined in Studies 1 and 2. In Study 1, participants made gender decisions on a large set of female faces interspersed with a few male faces. The ERP responses to facial characteristics of the female faces indicated that the N 170 amplitude from each side of the head was affected by information from eye region and by facial layout: the right N 170 was affected by eye color and by face width, while the left N 170 was affected by eye size and by the relation between the sizes of the top and bottom parts of a face. In contrast, the P 100 and the N 250 components were largely unaffected by facial characteristics. These results thus provided direct evidence for the link between the N 170 and structural encoding of faces. In Study 2, focusing on the face recognition stage, we manipulated <b>face</b> identity <b>strength</b> by morphing individual faces to an "average" face. Participants performed a face identification task. The effect of <b>face</b> identity <b>strength</b> was found on the late P 2 and the N 250 components: as identity strength decreased from an individual face to the "average" face, the late P 2 increased and the N 250 decreased. In contrast, the P 100, the N 170 and the early P 2 components were not affected by <b>face</b> identity <b>strength.</b> These results suggest that face recognition occurs after 200 ms, but not earlier. Finally, because faces are often associated with social information, we investigated in Study 3 how group membership might affect ERP responses to faces. After participants learned in- and out-group memberships of the face stimuli based on arbitrarily assigned nationality and university affiliation, we found that the N 170 latency differentiated in-group and out-group faces, taking longer to process the latter. In comparison, without group memberships, {{there was no difference in}} N 170 latency among the faces. This dissertation provides evidence that at a neural level, structural encoding of faces, indexed by the N 170, occurs within 200 ms. Face recognition, indexed by the late P 2 and the N 250, occurs shortly afterwards between 200 and 300 ms. Social cognitive factors can also influence face processing. The effect is already evident as early as 130 - 200 ms at the structural encoding stage...|$|R
