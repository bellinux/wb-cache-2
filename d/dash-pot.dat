The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{discrete}} element method (DEM) {{has been}} recognized as an effective tool to simulate soil–tool interactions. In this study, a saturated sand cutting model is developed using a commercial DEM software, Particle Flow Code in Two Dimension (PFC 2 D). In the model, soil are defined as particles with the basic PFC 2 D model, full coupling with a deformable fluid. The mechanical interactions between particles and also between particles and the walls are modeled by sprints, <b>dash-pots</b> and friction sliders. The properties of the material and interactions (Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus and density, coefficients of restitution, rolling and static friction) relate to the particle properties {{and not to the}} bulk properties. Such quantitative and qualitative models are essential for improving the design, selection and use of water saturated sand cutting implements, in different field sand under different conditions. This paper describes a numerical experimental investigation of the failure characteristics of two-dimensional water saturated sand cutting. Comprehensive simulated tests were carried out on sandy loam using a box apparatus and two model plane blades of rake angles 30 º, 60 º and two angles of friction 32 º, 42 º, respectively. Besides, there are two extreme densities of the sand, compacted and loose. These factors should provide a basis for the reliable prediction of the failure type...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Motivated {{by recent}} {{progress}} in viscoelastic indentation analysis, {{the identification of}} viscoelastic properties from materials exhibiting elastic, viscous and plastic material behaviour by means of nanoindentation is dealt with in this paper. Based on existing solutions for pure viscoelastic material behaviour, two methods allowing us to consider the effect of plastic deformation are presented: (i) the so-called double-indentation technique, with the second indentation characterised by pure viscoelastic material response and (ii) the use of spherical indenter geometries instead of commonly used pyramidal indenters avoiding plastic deformation at all. Both methods are applied to three different polymers, giving access to the model parameters of the fractional <b>dash-pot</b> {{which is used to}} describe the viscoelastic behaviour. The results obtained are compared with results from standard (single) indentation tests using a Berkovich indenter. Moreover, the influence of the maximum load, determining the amount of plastic material response, on the identified model parameters is investigated. Finally, the creep-compliance functions identified by nanoindentation are compared with the respective macroscopic creep-compliance functions obtained from bending-beam rheometer tests...|$|E

Moreover, the values of stresses obtained at different locations of the guide thimbles are also comparable with the stress values of the experiment determined at the same locations through strain gauges. Therefore, validation of the FE methodology is confirmed. The values of stresses are less than the design limit of the materials used for the grid and the guide thimble.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a vertical breakwater to breaking waves {{has been studied}} by the authors with prototype tests on two breakwaters in Genoa Voltri and one in Brindisi. The tests were interpreted by Mass Spring <b>Dash-pot</b> elements connected among {{them in order to}} represent the Array structure typical of a breakwater (MSDA model). The model is similar to the classical MSD one, except that it also considers the force exchanged by adjacent caissons through the foundation. The objective of this note is to present an analysis of the caisson interaction and to study and compare the different responses to breaker impacts on average European and Japanese caisson breakwaters. These represent typical section shapes using two areas with scaling rules relating caisson dimensions to the incident design significant wave height. Inertia, foundation stiffness and added masses are quite different for the two types of structures and their effect is analyzed. The dynamic response is presented in terms of a static equivalent response factor given {{as a function of the}} ratio between impact load duration and the main structure oscillation period, of the ratio between caisson length and width and of the fraction of the total mass represented by foundation added mass (the latter being the essential difference between European and Japanese design). Although the modeling of the array structure is essential to interpret the oscillations measured in the prototype, and is obviously important to study the effects of a load that varies along the breakwater, the prediction of the classical approach is similar in terms of maximum load on the foundations whenever the applied forcing is longitudinally homogeneous...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{adhesion}} between surfaces is {{a highly}} desirable property for many practical applications. The ability to control adhesion selectivity by design of near-surface architecture irrespective of surface chemistry is broadly appealing. The first chapter shows that highly selective interfacial properties can be achieved between surfaces patterned with complementary micro-channel structures: strongly enhanced work of adhesion between two matched patterns and highly attenuated adhesion between most others. Relative misalignment is accommodated by screw dislocations that run in a direction orthogonal to the channels. Dislocation energy governs the width of dislocation core; misorientation controls dislocation distribution through the Moire pattern of pillar/channel combinations on {{the two sides of}} the interface. This versatile system could be a useful experimental tool in assisting research on geometrycontrolled adhesion, while providing a test-bed for stability theories of interacting dislocations and crack fronts. The second chapter studies the adhesion selectivity by electrostatic complementarity. We consider the interaction between two flat surfaces separated by water in the presence of ions, each with simple striped pattern of alternating positive and negative surface charges, and each with zero net charge. We show that such surfaces have highly selective adhesion depending on the matching between the two charge patterns. Because a number of problems related to micro-structured surfaces require analysis of their contact mechanics and extraction of material properties of indentation ex- periments, the third chapter provides a complete numerical simulation package that allows for general analysis of the contact problems involving complex geometry. To solve the system of a large number of highly nonlinear equations, a virtual state relaxation method has been used by interposing a virtual <b>dash-pot</b> in the mechanical system. This method plots only the stable equilibriums for each displacement, and therefore the load-displacement curves are discontinuous at unstable jumps. It essentially generates the force-displacement curves that can be observed in real-world experiments. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{control of}} {{structure}} in polymer nanocomposites {{is critical for}} their performance but {{has been difficult to}} investigate systematically due to lack of suitable experimental model. This thesis investigated roles of various structural parameters in layered polymer-montmorillonite (MTM) clay nanocomposites manufactured using a layer-by-layer (LBL) technique. A continuum-based constitutive model was developed to predict the stress-strain response of the nanocomposites at low strain-rates. The systematic control over the nano-structure using the LBL method allowed an investigation of role of parameters like nanoparticle volume fraction, nanoparticle layer separation, nanoparticle layer stratification and interface between the polymer and nanoparticles. A series of polyurethane (PU) -MTM nanocomposites {{with a wide range of}} volume fractions of MTM nanoparticles was manufactured by varying the MTM layer separation. The nanocomposites demonstrated an increasing yield strength and stiffness with increased MTM volume fraction. A transition from ductile to brittle behavior was observed at a high volume fraction of nanoparticles and a critical nanoparticle separation was found to exist, below which brittle behavior dominated the response of the nanocomposites. The presence of nanoparticle stratified layer was believed to provide an additional slip mechanism, resulting in increased ductility. The interface between the polymer and the nanoparticle layers was altered by incorporating polyacrylic acid (PAA) using an exponential (e) -LBL method. The presence of a stronger interface resulted in enhanced stiffness and strength in the nanocomposites. For the development of the constitutive model, the nanocomposite volume was assumed to be occupied by multi-layers of bulk polymer and effective particles consisting of MTM layers and a modified PU interphase region in proximity to MTM layers. A hyperelastic model was used to capture the response of bulk polymer. The effective particle component of the model consisted of a linear elastic spring, a viscoplastic <b>dash-pot</b> and a non-linear spring element to capture the initial elastic response, yield strength and strain-hardening response, respectively. The model predicted all the major features of the uniaxial stress-strain constitutive response of a family of PU-MTM nanocomposites, thus confirming the efficacy of the proposed constitutive model...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{developing}} Galerkin based solution strategies for several important classes of differential equations involving derivatives and integrals of various fractional orders. Fractional order calculus finds use {{in several areas}} of science and engineering. The use of fractional derivatives may arise purely from the mathematical viewpoint, as in controller design, or it may arise from the underlying physics of the material, as in the damping behavior of viscoelastic materials. The physical origins of the fractional damping motivated us to study viscoelastic behavior of disordered materials at three levels. At the first level, we review two first principles models of rubber viscoelasticity. This leads us to study, at the next two levels, two simple disordered systems. The study of these two simplified systems prompted us towards an infinite dimensional system which is mathematically equivalent to a fractional order derivative or integral. This infinite dimensional system forms {{the starting point for}} our Galerkin projection based approximation scheme. In a simplified study of disordered viscoelastic materials, we show that the networks of springs and <b>dash-pots</b> can lead to fractional power law relaxation if the damping coefficients of the <b>dash-pots</b> follow a certain type of random distribution. Similar results are obtained when we consider a more simplified model, which involves a random system coefficient matrix. Fractional order derivatives and integrals are infinite dimensional operators and non-local in time: the history of the state variable is needed to evaluate such operators. This non-local nature leads to expensive long-time computations (O(t 2) computations for solution up to time t). A finite dimensional approximation of the fractional order derivative can alleviate this problem. We present one such approximation using a Galerkin projection. The original infinite dimensional system is replaced with an equivalent infinite dimensional system involving a partial differential equation (PDE). The Galerkin projection reduces the PDE to a finite system of ODEs. These ODEs can be solved cheaply (O(t) computations). The shape functions used for the Galerkin projection are important, and given attention. Calculations with both global shape functions as well as finite elements are presented. The discretization strategy is improved in a few steps until, finally, very good performance is obtained over a user-specifiable frequency range (not including zero). In particular, numerical examples are presented showing good performance for frequencies varying over more than 7 orders of magnitude. For any discretization held fixed, however, errors will be significant at sufficiently low or high frequencies. We discuss why such asymptotics may not significantly impact the engineering utility of the method. Following this, we identify eight important classes of fractional differential equations (FDEs) and fractional integrodifferential equations (FIEs), and develop separate Galerkin based solution strategies for each of them. Distinction between these classes arises from the fact that both Riemann-Liouville as well as Caputo type derivatives used in this work do not, in general, follow either the law of exponents or the commutative property. Criteria used to identify these classes include; the initial conditions used, order of the highest derivative, integer or fractional order highest derivative, single or multiterm fractional derivatives and integrals. A key feature of our approximation scheme is the development of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) when the highest order derivative is fractional or the equation involves fractional integrals only. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximation scheme, we compare the numerical results with analytical solutions, when available, or with suitably developed series solutions. Our approximation scheme matches analytical/series solutions very well for all classes considered...|$|R

This study {{has been made in}} an attempt to find the structural integrity of the fuel assembly (FA) of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant- 1 (CHASNUPP- 1) at room temperature in air. The non-linear contact and structural tensile analysis have been performed using ANSYS 13. 0, {{in order to determine the}} fuel assembly (FA) elongation behaviour as well as the location and values of the stress intensity and stresses developed in axial direction under applied tensile load of 9800 [*]N or 2 [*]g being the fuel assembly handling or lifting load [Y.  Zhang et al., Fuel assembly design report, SNERDI, China, 1994]. The finite element (FE) model comprises spacer grids, fuel rods, flexible contacts between the fuel rods and grid's supports system and guide thimbles with <b>dash-pots</b> and flow holes, in addition to the spot welds between spacer grids and guide thimbles, has been developed using Shell 181, Conta 174 and Targe 170 elements. FA is a non-straight structure. The actual behavior of the geometry is non-linear due to its curvature or design tolerance. It has been observed that fuel assembly elongation values obtained through FE analysis and experiment [SNERDI Tech. Doc., Mechanical strength and calculation for fuel assembly, Technical Report, F 3. 2. 1, China, 1994] under applied tensile load are comparable and show approximately linear behaviors. Therefore, it seems that the permanent elongation of fuel assembly may not occur at the specified load. Moreover, the values of stresses obtained at different locations of the fuel assembly are also comparable with the stress values of the experiment determined at the same locations through strain gauges. Since the results of both studies (analytical and experimental) are comparable, therefore, validation of the FE methodology is confirmed. The stress intensity of the FE model and maximum stresses developed along the guide thimbles in axial direction are less than the design stress limit of the materials used for the grid [ASTM, Standard specification for precipitation hardening nickel alloy (UNSN 07718) plate, sheet, and strip for high temperature service, B 670 - 80, USA, 2013], fuel rod [ASTM, Standard specification for wrought zirconium alloy seamless tubes for nuclear reactor fuel cladding, B 811 - 02, USA, 2002] and the guide thimble [ASTM, Standard specification for seamless stainless steel mechanical tubing, A 511 - 04, USA, 2004].

40|$|The soft tissue, called {{periodontal}} ligament (PDL), {{that connects}} the alveolar bone and the tooth root accounts {{to a large extent}} for the mobility, stress-distribution and, due to its viscoelastic properties, damping of the bone-tooth complex. The accurate prediction of these quantities is essential to new solutions in dental health care making the PDL {{one of the most important}} materials in dental biomechanics. Experimental data clearly shows that both the elastic and viscous responses of the PDL are highly nonlinear and different in tension and compression, furthermore its elasticity is stiffening at large strains whereas its viscosity is thinning, i. e. pseudo-plastic, at low strain-rates, both realized within the physiological range of the PDL. The mechanical models for the PDL found in literature, except for one, are simplistic because they use only linear elasticity and few incorporate a viscous contribution. In this thesis a new nonlinear large strain viscoelastic three-dimensional law is developed and applied to the PDL. To begin, a one-dimensional viscoelastic law is proposed based on the standard linear model with the linear springs and <b>dash-pots</b> replaced by nonlinear power law analogs possessing adjustable exponents. The elastic exponent controls the elastic nonlinearity rendering the elastic law either hardening or softening. Likewise, the viscous exponent controls the viscous nonlinearity, rendering the viscous law either thickening or thinning. A thorough investigation of this new nonlinear viscoelastic standard model reveals two key features: first, a finite stress relaxation time as a response of a step strain for a certain choice of viscous and elastic exponents; second, the controllable width of the phase-shift spectrum through the choice of combinations of the exponents. Since viscoelastic biological tissues show a large phase-shift spectrum this feature is an advantage of this original nonlinear law over linear ones. A family of (hyper) elastic closed-form invertible material laws is proposed and it is shown that the three-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional power law falls into that family. Now, the three-dimensional extension of the nonlinear model can be formulated using the appropriate potentials. After implementing the law into a finite element software, representative experiments, namely elastic traction and shear tests at low strain-rates, stress relaxation tests as responses to step strains and sinusoidal strain excitations, are performed in order to obtain reliable data needed for the identification of the law's parameters. The results of these experiments agree with existing data in the literature. After calibrating the law to the PDL's parameters using finite element simulations corresponding to the previous experiments the experimental and the numerical results agree well for the elastic tests and for the phase-shift spectra of the sinusoidal viscoelastic tests indicating nonlinear stiffening elastic and nonlinear pseudo-plastic viscous behavior. They agree less well for the amplitude as a function of frequency. Overall the proposed new nonlinear viscoelastic law based on the power law is capable of simulating the PDL better than a linear viscoelastic law...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 A {{computational}} {{model for a}} resonantly coupled alpha free-piston Stirling cooler is presented. The cooler consists of two isothermal working spaces for compression and expansion connected by a regenerator consisting of a stack of narrow parallel channels. The regenerator is assumed to have a linear temperature distribution along its axial direction and the working fluid is taken as an ideal gas. Control volume analysis is adapted in this model, in which each {{of the components of}} the cooler is considered a separate control volume. The compression piston is given a predetermined motion to provide the work needed by the cooler. The expansion piston and the gas trapped between the piston and the walls of the expansion cylinder are modeled as a mass, spring, and damper system. The motion of the compression piston generates a pressure difference across the cooler, and forces the working fluid to pass through the regenerator. The expansion piston responds to the pressure in its space according to Newton's second law of motion. The motion of the expansion piston is governed by the forces originating from the pressure and the cold side gas spring and <b>dash-pot.</b> In this way the dynamics of the moving pistons are coupled to the thermodynamics of the cooler system. A definition for the coefficient of performance (COP) that considers the heat transfer by conduction through the material making up the regenerator is introduced. This definition of the COP reflects the dependence of the cooler's performance on the length of the regenerator. From a systematic variation of this regenerator length, an optimal value can be found for a given set of operating parameters. Conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy along with ideal gas relations are used to form a set of equations fully describing the motion of the pistons and the thermal state of the cooler. A marching-in-time technique with a Runge-Kutta scheme of the fourth order is adapted to integrate the equation of motion. The plots of the motion of the pistons, the pressure-volume diagrams of the workspaces and the COP plots are provided to describe the cooler behavior...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} control the {{vibration}} response of high rise buildings during seismic events, energy absorbing passive damping devices are most commonly used for energy absorption. Today {{there are a number}} of types of manufactured dampers available in the market, which use a variety of materials and designs to obtain various levels of stiffness and damping. Some of these include friction, yielding, viscoelastic and viscous dampers. These dampers are usually installed between two load bearing elements (walls or columns) in new buildings. In existing buildings, which require retrofitting, they could be installed in cut-outs of shear walls, as evidenced from recent investigations. An effective damping system can result in higher levels of safety and comfort, and can also lead to considerable savings in the total cost of a building. This thesis treats seismic mitigation of multistorey buildings using embedded dampers. Three types of damping mechanisms, viz, friction, viscoelastic, and combined friction-viscoelastic were investigated. Finite element methods were employed in the analysis using the program ABAQUS version 6. 3. A direct integration dynamic analysis was carried out to obtain the damped and undamped responses of the structure in terms of deflections and accelerations at all storeys in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the damping system in mitigating the seismic response. The damping mechanisms have been modelled as (i) a linear spring and <b>dash-pot</b> in parallel for the viscoelastic damper, (ii) a contact pair with friction parameter for a friction damper and (iii) a hybrid damper consisting of both a viscoelastic and a friction damper. The earthquake events used in this study have been applied as acceleration time-histories at the base of the structure in the horizontal plane. Concrete material properties were chosen to represent the model as many high-rise buildings are constructed by using reinforced concrete. Several medium and high-rise building structures with embedded dampers in different configurations and placed in various locations throughout the structure were subjected to different earthquake loadings. Influence of damper type and properties, configuration and location were investigated. Results for the reduction in tip deflection and acceleration for a number of cases demonstrate the feasibility of the technique for seismic mitigation of these structures for a range of excitations, even when the dominant seismic frequencies match the natural frequency of the structure. Results also provide information which can be used for optimal damper placement for seismic mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Alloys {{near the}} {{composition}} In- 20 at. % Tl {{are examples of}} a class of material that has a twinned non-cubic structure and possesses high mechanical hysteresis. The present investigation {{is concerned with the}} mechanism by which this high damping is generated. It is well established that the application of stress to the twinned tetragonal structure moves the twin boundaries in the sense that gives partial relief of the applied strain. It is further observed that the boundary movement lags behind the stress during cyclic straining. The strain corresponding to the boundary hysteresis can be deduced from the twin crystallography and the unit cell parameters and agrees with the measured hysteresis. So {{it is clear that the}} hysteresis arises from the irreversible boundary movements. The purpose of this investigation was to establish the cause of this irreversible movement. The torsional hysteresis of 2 mm diameter cylinders of polycrystalline In-Tl alloys was measured by plotting torque-twist curves during cycles of stress between constant strain limits over the frequency range 0. 004 to 3. 0 C/s and for temperatures from - 65 to + 45 °C. The hysteresis loops for 18, 20 and 22 at. % Tl reached a maximum area at temperatures which depended on frequency through an activation energy of about 18, 000 cal. mole. This is close to the published value for the tracer diffusion of Tl in In of 15, 500 cal. mole, which is not a particularly reliable figure because of doubts in the interpretation of the experimental data. The relationship between these two energies suggests that the mechanical hysteresis might be explained by the existence of a force on the twin boundaries caused by an ordering of Tl atoms relative to the orientation of the C axis of the tetragonal cell. If boundaries are suddenly moved at low temperatures the orientation of the C axis will change in the swept-out region and the Tl atoms, which will not have time to jump to the new preferred sites, find themselves in high energy positions. This generates a force which will return the boundaries to their original position when the stress is removed. The rubber-like behaviour at low temperatures is thus explained. At higher temperatures the atoms rapidly move to the newly preferred sites, the boundary is stabilised in the new position, and a permanent deformation results. These mechanical characteristics are reproduced by the model of a Maxwell Solid, comprising a spring and <b>dash-pot</b> in series, and so the possibility that this model reproduces the behaviour of In-Tl was explored. This was done by comparing the hysteresis and the stress relaxation behaviour. When the twin boundaries in the In-Tl alloy are suddenly displaced, the stress required to keep the strain constant steadily relaxes ultimately to zero, as is the case with the Maxwell Solid. It did not prove to be possible to relate the kinetics of stress relaxation, however, to the hysteresis behaviour. The reasons for this will be discussed, in terms of the likely existence of several mechanisms contributing to the deformation behaviour...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for predicting {{the short term}} and long term responses of viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials is developed in this research. The methodology aims to predict the behaviour of viscoelastic/viscoplastic isotropic material subjected to loading in isochronous condition (temperature effects are not included). The methodology is implemented in a finite element (FE) procedure through a user defined material subroutine (UMAT) which is linked to ABAQUS software and is called at each increment and material calculation point. The built-in viscoelastic ABAQUS procedure {{is not able to}} analyze the nonlinear behaviour of viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials, hence, a specific procedure needs to be defined, which justifies the application of user generated subroutines for material definition in this work. The development of the methodology consists of four major parts: 1) development of material models for Nonlinear Viscoelastic (NVE) and Nonlinear Viscoplastic (NVP) materials; 2) development of macromechanical NVE and NVP models; 3) development of failure model; 4) implementation in finite element procedure. For the first part, a new approach is developed for macromechanical constitutive formulations for time-dependent materials. In particular, two phenomenological constitutive models for polymer materials are illustrated, describing time-dependent and nonlinear mechanical behaviour, the Nonlinear Viscoelastic (NVE) and Nonlinear Viscoplastic (NVP) material models. In the proposed approach, short term creep test data are used for modelling both short term and long term responses. A major part of the experiments were done by Liu (Liu, 2007), while the rest have been provided by ExxonMobil, a division of Imperial Oil. The differential form of the model is used to simulate typical Nonlinear Viscoelastic polymeric behaviour using a combination of springs and dashpots. Unified plasticity theory is then used to develop the second model, the Nonlinear Viscoplastic one. Least squares fitting is applied for the determination of material parameters for both models based on experimental results. Due to practical constraints, experimental data are usually available for short term time-frames only. In the presented proposed formulation, the material parameters determined from short term testing are used to obtain material parameter relationships for predicting the long term material response. This is done by extending short term information for longer time frames. The second part, which is the development of macromechanical NVE and NVP models, is done using two theories: multiple integral and single integral representations of constitutive equations. Multiple integral representation for three-dimensional behaviour is an extension of linear superposition to the nonlinear range. The method is based on the small strain assumption, but is extended to large deformation for materials in which the stress-strain relation is nonlinear and the concept of incompressibility is governing. Similar to the material modelling (first part), the modelling process uses springs and <b>dash-pots,</b> and a power-law approximation function method for viscoelastic and viscoplastic nonlinear behaviour, respectively. Single integral representation, on the other hand, is a simplified form of multiple integral representation. Based on Schapery's single integral constitutive law, a solution procedure has been provided to solve nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour. This procedure is applicable to three dimensional problems and uses time- and stress-dependent material properties to characterize the nonlinear behaviour of the material. The approximation equations describing material behaviour are defined based on the material response in a short test time frame. For this estimation, Prony series method is used the basis of the constitutive relations is the non-separable form of the equations. For the failure modelling (third part), an energy based method of delayed failure is presented. The delayed failure approach is applicable to both NVE and NVP modelling for both multiple integral and single integral theories. The approach works with limiting the strain energy of the material to a boundary which is the resilience limit. Here, based on Schapery's single integral constitutive law, the delayed failure criterion is employed for NVE modelling, which helps to solve for the polymer’s time to failure involving material nonlinearity. In the last part, the proposed viscoelastic and viscoplastic models, as well as the delayed failure criterion, are implemented in a user material algorithm of the FE general purpose program ABAQUS and the validity of the models is assessed by comparisons with experimental observations from tests on polyethylene material samples in one-dimensional tensile loading (these tests are done by others). The experiments are short term loading, long term loading, and step loading. Comparisons show that the proposed constitutive model can satisfactorily represent the time-dependent mechanical behaviour of polymers even for long term predictions and the developed formulation provides a flexible and reliable framework for predicting load responses of polymers. It is also concluded that with proper material properties to reflect the deformation involved in the mechanical tests, the deformation behaviour observed experimentally can be accurately predicted using the Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation...|$|R
