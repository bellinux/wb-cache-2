5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe.

5|$|Biographers Franklin and Mary Wickwire {{note that}} Cornwallis's attitudes towards {{governance}} presaged {{the idea of}} responsible government that took <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom in the 19th century. Later British administrators and the Indian Civil Service adopted his ideas of service by example and service for the overall benefit of the population. Historian Marguerite Wilbur called the era of Cornwallis and Mornington the Golden Age of British rule in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between The Undertaker and Mark Henry. During the match, Henry hit Undertaker {{with a series}} of {{splashes}} and superplexes, but Undertaker was able to continue fighting in the match. Henry put Undertaker in the bear hug but Undertaker broke the <b>hold.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, Undertaker delivered a Last Ride to Henry from the top rope. Undertaker then pinned Henry to win the match.|$|E
30|$|Let now u≥ 1. If 0 < p≤ 1, then {{inequality}} (1) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{reverse direction}} and, therefore, since u/p> 0, also (2) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reverse direction.

Symmetrically, if p< 0, inequality (1) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reverse direction, but since u/p> 0 in this case, still inequality (2) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reverse direction.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of an}} attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of an attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1615 and 1616 Koniecpolski gained further {{experience}} in Ukraine, fighting the Tatar hordes, {{but failed to}} destroy or capture any sizable enemy units. In 1616, Katarzyna died while giving birth to in labor with Koniecpolski's first son, Andrzej. The following year, Koniecpolski {{took part in the}} Moldavian Magnate Wars alongside Żołkiewski, and stood against Iskender Pasha's powerful Turkish army. The conflict ended that year with a negotiated cease-fire. Following negotiations with the Cossacks in Olszanica, Koniecpolski reduced the Cossack register to 1,000, thereby limiting the number of positions that the Cossacks could <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth military. He also banned raids on the Black Sea. Such raids, which pillaged wealthy Ottoman cities, contributed to the Cossacks' income but provoked retaliatory raids into Commonwealth territory.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Mussolini {{took his}} country into World War II {{on the side}} of Nazi Germany but soon met with {{military}} failure. By the autumn of 1943, he was reduced to being the leader of a German puppet state in northern Italy and was faced with the Allied advance from the south and an increasingly violent internal conflict with the partisans. In April 1945, with the Allies breaking through the last German defences in northern Italy and a general uprising of the partisans taking <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities, Mussolini's situation became untenable. On 25 April he fled Milan, where he had been based, and tried to escape to the Swiss border. He and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were captured on 27 April by local partisans near the village of Dongo on Lake Como. Mussolini and Petacci were shot the following afternoon, two days before Adolf Hitler's suicide.|$|E

5|$|In June 1870, Rose Crawshay held {{a public}} meeting at her home, {{probably}} the first in Wales to discuss women's suffrage, but she was later taken to task by the local newspaper for disturbing the peace and leading Wales' women astray. The first suffrage tour of Welsh towns was conducted the following year by Jessie Craigen, who travelled {{the south of the}} country visiting Pontypool, Pembroke Dock, Neyland, Saundersfoot and Newport. On 4 March 1872, Mrs. Crawshay held a second meeting, in Merthyr Tydfill, which resulted in a new petition being delivered, the effect of which saw the signing of petitions from Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, Denbighshire and Cardiganshire. Later that year the Bristol & West of England Society for Women's Suffrage sent two of their members, Caroline Biggs and Lilias Ashworth, on a sponsored speaking tour of south Wales which took in Pontypool, Newport, Cardiff and Haverfordwest. Despite the actions of several prominent Welsh women, such as Lady Amberley and Miss Gertrude Jenner of Wenvoe, no real suffrage movements took <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s and the country was reliant on speaking tours from members of English societies, predominantly from Bristol, London and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of Stephen's reign were largely successful, despite a series of attacks on his {{possessions}} in England and Normandy by David I of Scotland, Welsh rebels, and the Empress Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou. In 1138 the Empress's half-brother Robert of Gloucester rebelled against Stephen, threatening civil war. Together with his close advisor, Waleran de Beaumont, Stephen took firm steps to defend his rule, including arresting a powerful family of bishops. When the Empress and Robert invaded in 1139, however, Stephen was unable to crush the revolt rapidly, and it took <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-west of England. Captured {{at the battle of}} Lincoln in 1141, Stephen was abandoned by many of his followers and lost control of Normandy. Stephen was freed only after his wife and William of Ypres, one of his military commanders, captured Robert at the Rout of Winchester, but the war dragged on for many years with neither side able to win an advantage.|$|E
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{was also}} {{building}} branches in North Wales, which {{were intended to}} link up to the River Dee at Chester, but eventually linked to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, just {{to the north of}} Nantwich, in 1805. The canal then became the middle section of a much longer and more profitable canal. The two companies merged in 1813, becoming the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. When the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was proposed in 1826, which would provide a link from Nantwich to Wolverhampton and the Birmingham canal system, the company saw it as an opportunity to build the Middlewich Branch, which would provide a connection to Manchester and the Potteries. The branch opened in 1833, and the Junction Canal opened in 1835. Amalgamation followed in 1845, with the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The following year, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed from the Ellesmere and Chester company, which also took over a number of canals which joined theirs. Plans to convert some of the canals to railways were put on <b>hold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1847, when the canal company was leased to the London and North Western Railway. Under railway control, the canals continued to operate successfully, but decline set in during the 20th century, and when many of the adjoining canals were closed in 1944, the sections which had been the Ellesmere and Chester Canal and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, together with the Middlewich Branch, were retained.|$|E
