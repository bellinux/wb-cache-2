500|$|The {{specific}} epithet vulpinus {{is derived}} from the Latin vulpes meaning [...] "fox", and in some older literature the species name was given incorrectly as Alopias vulpes. [...] "Fox shark" [...] is the earliest known English name for this species and is rooted in classical antiquity, from a belief that it was especially cunning. In the mid-19th century, the name [...] "fox" [...] was mostly superseded by [...] "thresher", referencing the shark's flail-like use of its tail. This species is often known simply as thresher shark or thresher; Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder introduced the name [...] "common thresher" [...] in 1945 to differentiate it from the bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus). It is also known by many other common names, including Atlantic thresher, <b>grayfish,</b> green thresher, long-tailed shark, sea ape, sea fox, slasher, swiveltail, thintail thresher, thrasher shark, and whiptail shark.|$|E
50|$|The American {{submarine}} <b>Grayfish,</b> under Lieutenant Commander/Commander Barney Doyle (Glenn Ford), {{searches for}} the Shinaru, one of the Japanese aircraft carriers that led the attack on Pearl Harbor. Doyle receives word that the target has an escort, including a transport ship Yoshida Maru carrying his wife and child, who were captured in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|As {{luck would}} have it, <b>Grayfish</b> finds the ships. Doyle's second in command, Lieutenant/Lieutenant Commander Archer Sloan (Ernest Borgnine) tries to talk his friend out of risking {{the lives of his}} family, but Doyle {{proceeds}} with the attack. To their horror, their torpedoes sink the transport. The Japanese make no attempt to rescue the survivors, hoping to lure the sub to the surface. Doyle is forced to leave the prisoners to drown.|$|E
50|$|Doyle {{manages to}} follow the Shinaru into Tokyo Bay itself and tries again to sink his nemesis, but fails and barely escapes from Japanese destroyers. The <b>Grayfish</b> then returns to Pearl Harbor. There, Vice Admiral Setton (Philip Ober) wants to promote Doyle to a desk job, but his anguished second-in-command Sloan begs {{on behalf of his}} friend and {{superior}} officer for and gets one last chance at the Shinaru. Sloan turns down a command of his own to accompany him.|$|E
50|$|At the Kaspersky Security Analysts Summit held in Mexico on February 16, 2015, Kaspersky Lab {{announced}} its {{discovery of the}} Equation Group. According to Kaspersky Lab's report, the group has been active since at least 2001, with more than 60 actors. The malware used in their operations, dubbed EquationDrug and <b>GrayFish,</b> {{is found to be}} capable of reprogramming hard disk drive firmware. Because of the advanced techniques involved and high degree of covertness, the group is suspected of ties to the NSA, but Kaspersky Lab has not identified the actors behind the group.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the family Gadidae. It is a bottom-dwelling fish found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, mainly on the {{continental}} shelf and upper slopes, to depths of about 900 m. It can grow to a length of a meter or so and is found in large schools. It is an important commercial food species and {{is also known as}} gray cod or grey cod, and <b>grayfish</b> or greyfish. Fishing for this species is regulated with quotas being allotted for hook and line fishing, pots, and bottom trawls.|$|E

40|$|Reduction in the {{moisture}} {{content of the}} medium produced {{a profound effect on}} the colony morphology of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni. Fresh medium produced flat, <b>grayfish,</b> spreading colonies with an irregular shape and variety appearance. Plates that were incubated at 30 degrees C for 48 h produced round, convex, butyrous colonies with an entire edge. Plates incubated at 30 degrees C for 24 h before inoculation produced colonies of an intermediate nature; they were round and raised, but not convex, and slightly water or mucoid in nature. This marked effect produced by moisture content of the medium was reproducible and may account for the variation in colonies observed by other investigators...|$|E
