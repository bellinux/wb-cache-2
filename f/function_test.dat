25|$|Alcoholism is {{normally}} associated with nutritional deficiencies, which {{may contribute to}} the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Thiamine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay thiamine in the blood and urine. A liver <b>function</b> <b>test</b> may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.|$|E

25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a <b>function</b> <b>test.</b> This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary <b>function</b> <b>test,</b> or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{who had a}} biliary-enteric {{anastomosis}} {{often have}} elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> are associated with recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Thirty-two patients, who received a biliary-enteric anatomosis for benign biliary disease were evaluated. Follow-up consisted of the patient's history, physical examination, determination of liver <b>function</b> <b>tests,</b> ultrasonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy using 99 mTc-HIDA. Median duration of follow-up was 45 months (range: 1 - 192) and liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were elevated in 22 patients (69 %) at some time during follow-up. Dilated intrahepatic ducts were found in 3 of 30 patients (10 %), all of whom had elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> at follow-up. Delayed passage from the liver was observed using scintigraphy in 10 (31 %) of the patients. Seven patients (22 %) experienced one episode of cholangitis and none experienced more than one episode. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex was an independent risk factor for elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> (odds ratio: 10. 9; P < 0. 05). For cholangitis, no risk factors could be identified. It is concluded that elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> are relatively common after a biliary-enteric anastomosis for benign biliary tract disease and are not predictive of the occurrence of cholangitis. We, therefore, recommend omitting routine laboratory screening for elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> in the follow-up of a biliary-enteric anastomosi...|$|R
40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} {{motor neuron disease}} (MND) in Australia, the approach to respiratory management of patients with this disease will more commonly face the respiratory physician. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if standard respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> could determine the presence of nocturnal hypoxia (NH) in patients with MND. Methods: Respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were used to examine daytime respiratory function, and sleep studies were used to detect NH in 16 consecutive patients with MND and in 9 healthy control subjects. Demographic data, clinical parameters, respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> and sleep studies were obtained. Statistical analyses were carried out using t-tests and anova, where appropriate. Results: NH was detected in 50 % of patients with MND, with no hypoxic events detected in the control group. Standard respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were not able to predict the presence of NH. Conclusion: There was no correlation between respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> and NH. This study emphasizes the inability of standard respiratory <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> to predict NH that may arise early in the course of MND. 4 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Guidelines {{provide a}} Class IA {{recommendation}} {{for the use}} of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there is interindividual variability in the pharmacodynamic response to antiplatelet medications. Some patients present with a status of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) during platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> after standard doses of antiplatelet drugs, reflecting a failure to achieve adequate platelet inhibition. As an example, patients with HPR on clopidogrel are at increased risk for thrombotic events, particularly for stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, but cardiovascular mortality is also elevated. On the contrary, low on-treatment platelet reactivity or an enhanced response to antiplatelet medications has been linked to a higher risk for bleeding. Although both thrombotic and bleeding events are multifactorial in origin, there is supportive evidence for the prognostic value of platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> for risk prediction of both sides of the coin. However, although small studies have provided evidence that treatment adjustments based on platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> results may improve clinical outcomes, the available randomized controlled trials showed no benefit of modifying antiplatelet treatment based on platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing.</b> This review presents the current evidence regarding platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in patients undergoing PCI. The prognostic value of platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> regarding ischemic and bleeding events is highlighted. Furthermore, the value of platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> for guiding treatment and possible explanations for the so-far negative trial results are presented.
