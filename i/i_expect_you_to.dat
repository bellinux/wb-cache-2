The song has been noted by John Murphy of musicOMH to be reminiscent of [...] "Gwen Stefani's quieter moments." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Unusual You" [...] "goes for that shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson rather than strict Madonna-style workouts." [...] According to Chris Richards of The Washington Post, Spears's vocals in the song are transformed into [...] "a spectral [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unusual You" [...] talks about an experienced woman finding unexpected love, with Spears voicing the lines, [...] "Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart? / <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> / So why haven't you?." ...|$|E
500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. [...] Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Jackson left the foster home, his dad said, [...] "Look, {{every day with}} me can be a day of heaven on earth. Or every day, I will tear your behind all to pieces. It {{depends on what you}} want." [...] Jackson's dad also told him, [...] "'I expect you to study. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do well in school. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> obey me. And don't come back to me with excuses, because I want you to make {{something}} of yourself.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say {{something}} without my prompting you. You {{know that it}} was outrageous for me to talk about your apparition without your leave, and to be the means of its getting into the newspapers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not give more! Why, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{head the}} list {{with a cool}} hundred. With your property, you should never put down a {{signature}} for less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are {{the views}} <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hold," [...] he declared. [...] "I believe Mrs. Chisholm will share my {{gratification}} {{if you find}} Evelyn disposed to listen to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} the {{question}} which <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither {{plan will}} do. I don't want trade rubbish and {{money is not}} much use. I need the goods <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> bring. If <b>you</b> refuse <b>to</b> supply me, <b>you</b> miss a chance you will not get again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "After {{what you}} told me about him, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> would {{recognize}} him the moment you saw him. But you did not know him; you did not do anything <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do; and <b>I</b> was very much disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means. I'm {{just the}} spectator. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make the entertainment. I'm {{sure it will}} be a good show, {{although}} the price is rather high." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now look here, Ruby; I {{have come}} {{to speak to you}} very seriously, and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear me. Nobody can make you marry Mr Crumb, unless you please.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{interested}} in that. I {{want to see what}} you're doing. And <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be prepared to describe your work fully. I'll be there shortly. Half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are {{not half}} as glad as <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be--and please don't think that I am marrying without love. I only {{admit that it}} is not the sort of love one reads of in novels, but <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> it is just as real.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>you</b> {{walk over}} <b>to</b> Broadstone?" [...] he said. [...] "It will do you good. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay with me, but <b>I</b> don't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be stuck {{down to this}} tollhouse all day. I am going about the farm to-day, but <b>I</b> shall <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, at that rate, {{you will}} have been here only six weeks. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no {{occasion}} for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{treat the}} matter lightly," [...] he continued. [...] "To me it seems serious enough. I have {{fulfilled}} {{my part of}} our marriage contract. Can you wonder that <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fulfil yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her husband {{bent over}} her. [...] "You {{look like you}} were in a brown study. Scared? <b>I</b> don't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think Gopher Prairie is a paradise, after St. Paul. <b>I</b> don't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be crazy about it, at first. But you'll come to like it so much--life's so free here and best people on earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{it was a}} trust," [...] said Romola, in a low but {{distinct}} voice. [...] "He trusted me, {{he trusted}} you, Tito. <b>I</b> did not <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> feel anything else about it--to feel as I do--but <b>I</b> did <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> feel that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] she replied, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{begin by}} sending Mr. Hemphill away. You know I {{could not do}} it, but I should {{think it would be}} easy for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{his arrival}} at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with an {{expression}} that {{was as good as}} saying, [...] "You are very much what <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] had given him a good meal, a little money, and, late as it was getting, dispatched him to Jude by the next train, wishing her husband Cartlett, who was out, not to see him.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{come down}} the river. I {{have been waiting for}} you these five years." [...] Mordecai's deep-sunk eyes were fixed on those of the friend who had at last arrived with a look of affectionate dependence, at once pathetic and solemn. Deronda's {{sensitiveness}} was not the less responsive because he could not but believe that this strangely-disclosed relation was founded on an illusion.|$|R
60|$|I met George in {{the street}} a few days ago, {{and he gave me}} a {{wonderful}} account of the effect of your natural element upon you at Ramsgate. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come back looking about twenty-nine, and feeling about nineteen.|$|E
