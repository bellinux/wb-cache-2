5|$|The {{brain is}} the largest known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
25|$|The <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> {{varies widely}} between species. The La Plata dolphin has an EQ of {{approximately}} 1.67; the Ganges River dolphin of 1.55; the orca of 2.57; the bottlenose dolphin of 4.14; and the tucuxi dolphin of 4.56; In comparison to other animals, elephants have an EQ ranging from 1.13 to 2.36; chimpanzees of approximately 2.49; dogs of 1.17; cats of 1.00; and mice of 0.50.|$|E

25|$|Because endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, {{and because}} brain matter {{requires}} {{large amounts of}} energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs {{appear to have been}} as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain to}} body mass ratio (as {{distinct}} from <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient)</b> in {{some members of}} the odontocete superfamily Delphinoidea (dolphins, porpoises, belugas, and narwhals) is greater than modern humans, and greater than all other mammals (there is debate whether that of the treeshrew might be second in place of humans). In some dolphins, it is less than half that of humans: 0.9% versus 2.1%. This comparison seems more favorable if the large amount of blubber (15-20% of mass) that dolphins require for insulation is omitted.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles are {{generally}} considered less intelligent than mammals and birds. The {{size of their}} brain relative to their body is much {{less than that of}} mammals, the <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> being about one tenth of that of mammals, though larger reptiles can show more complex brain development. Larger lizards, like the monitors, are known to exhibit complex behavior, including cooperation. Crocodiles have relatively larger brains and show a fairly complex social structure. The Komodo dragon is even known to engage in play, as are turtles, which are also considered to be social creatures and sometimes switch between monogamy and promiscuity in their sexual behavior. One study found that wood turtles were better than white rats at learning to navigate mazes.|$|E
50|$|Philovenator is a troodontid, a {{group of}} small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique {{features}} of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth.

50|$|Biologist Stephen Jay Gould {{has noted}} that {{if one looks at}} {{vertebrates}} with very low <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotients,</b> their brains are slightly less massive than their spinal cords. Theoretically, intelligence might correlate with the absolute amount of brain an animal has after subtracting the weight of the spinal cord from the brain. This formula is useless for invertebrates because they do not have spinal cords or, in some cases, central nervous systems.|$|R

25|$|Brain {{size was}} {{previously}} considered a major {{indicator of the}} intelligence of an animal. However, many other factors also affect intelligence. Recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the usefulness of brain size as an indicator. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may {{increase the amount of}} brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> (EQ) that can be used as another indication of the animal's intelligence.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Dale A. Russell, then {{curator of}} {{vertebrate}} fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for Stenonychosaurus, {{if it had}} not perished in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted {{that there had been a}} steady increase in the <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in Stenonychosaurus evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100cm3, comparable to that of a human.|$|E
50|$|<b>Encephalization</b> <b>quotients</b> (EQs) may {{indicate}} how much brain power a species has {{in comparison to}} other mammals. Primates lie {{at the top of}} this range with humans having the highest EQ score. EQ has a high degree of correlation with the ecological conditions of an animal such as its feeding behaviours and food it consumes. Leaf eating monkeys have lower EQ than frugivorous or omnivorous monkeys since they have to work harder to forage than monkeys which eat abundant, easy to find leaves.|$|R

Talos is approximately 2 m in length, and its weight has been estimated at thirty-eight kilograms. Talos had a sickle claw.

However, the holotype and paratype are subadults; specimens are known with about twice their length.|$|R
500|$|In 2001, the physician-scientist Frank Seebacher {{proposed}} a new polynomial method of calculating body-mass estimates for dinosaurs (using body-length, depth, and width), and found Giganotosaurus to have weighed [...] (based {{on the original}} [...] length estimate). In their 2002 description of the braincase of Giganotosaurus, Coria and Currie gave a length estimate of [...] for the holotype skull, and calculated a weight of [...] by extrapolating from the [...] circumference of the femur-shaft. This resulted in an <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient</b> (a measure of relative brain size) of 1.9. In 2004, Gerardo V.

2500|$|Brain morphometry is a {{subfield}} of both morphometry and {{the brain}} sciences, concerned with the measurement of brain structures and changes thereof during development, aging, learning, disease and evolution. Since autopsy-like dissection is generally impossible on living brains, brain morphometry starts with noninvasive neuroimaging data, typically obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (or MRI for short). These data are born digital, which allows researchers to analyze the brain images further by using advanced mathematical and statistical methods such as shape quantification or multivariate analysis. This allows researchers to quantify anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape, mass, volume (e.g. of the hippocampus, or of the primary versus secondary visual cortex), and to derive more specific information, such as the <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotient,</b> grey matter density and white matter connectivity, gyrification, cortical thickness, or the amount of cerebrospinal fluid. These variables can then be mapped within the brain volume or on the brain surface, providing a convenient way to assess their pattern and extent over time, across individuals or even between different biological species. The field is rapidly evolving along with neuroimaging techniques [...] which deliver the underlying data [...] but also develops in part independently from them, {{as part of the}} emerging field of neuroinformatics, which is concerned with developing and adapting algorithms to analyze those data.|$|E

Byronosaurus is one of few troodontids that have no serrations on its teeth, similar to its closest relative Xixiasaurus. Byronosaurus was 1.5 m long and 50 cm tall. It weighed only about 4 kilograms (9 lbs). Unlike most other troodontids, its teeth seem to lack serrations. They are instead needle-like, probably best suited for catching small birds, lizards and mammals. Specifically, they resemble those of Archaeopteryx.|$|R

Linhevenator is a rather large troodontid with an estimated body weight of 23 kg. The arms are relatively short but the humerus is very robust. The describers suggest the arm might have been used for digging or climbing. The first toe was preserved in a lateral position, instead of pointing forwards. Linhevenator has a dromaeosaurid-like pedal digit II, carrying a sickle-claw larger than that of basal troodontids.|$|R

The study found that Tyrannosauruss relative brain size was still within the range of modern reptiles, being at most 2 standard deviations above the mean of non-avian reptile EQs. The estimates for the ratio of cerebrum mass to brain mass would range from 47.5 to 49.53 percent. According to the study, this is more than the lowest estimates for extant birds (44.6 percent), but still close to the typical ratios of the smallest sexually mature alligators which range from 45.9–47.9 percent.|$|R
40|$|The australopithecines and Homo habilis {{have been}} publicized {{for years as}} {{examples}} of evolutionary transitional forms that launched our own human lineage. Dogmatic evolutionists have rationalized these claims {{on the basis of}} brain expansion, <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotients,</b> and bipedalism. However, any evolutionary justification for brain expansion in these extinct creatures must rest in a precise model for the determination of body mass. To insure an accurate body mass model, one must take into account whether the animal is quadruped, facultative biped, or obligatory biped. Past body mass estimates for the australopithecines and Homo habilis were based on assumptions about their bipedalism that have proven to be erroneous. When a body mass model is used accounting for the facultative bipedalism of the australopithecines and Homo habilis, the data shows that they are not highly encephalized, and hence nothing more than a microevolutionary adaptation of the pan-troglodytes...|$|R
5000|$|Mei is a troodontid, a {{group of}} small, bird-like, [...] maniraptorans.

The type fossil is a young juvenile about 53 cm long, complete and exceptionally well preserved in three-dimensional detail, with the snout nestled beneath one of the forelimbs and the legs neatly folded beneath the body, similar to the roosting position of modern birds. This posture provides another behavioral link between birds and dinosaurs. The chemistry of the matrix stone and the resting pose indicate the living animal was probably buried instantly in volcanic ash. A second specimen, DNHM D2154, was also preserved in a sleeping posture.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{variation in}} brain size and complexity that {{is evident in}} sharks and holocephalans is related to both phylogeny and ecology. Relative brain size (expressed as <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotients)</b> and the relative development of the five major brain areas (the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, and medulla) was assessed for over 40 species from 20 families that represent a range of different lifestyles and occupy a number of habitats. In addition, an index (1 - 5) quantifying structural complexity of the cerebellum was created based on length, number, and depth of folds. Although the variation in brain size, morphology, and complexity {{is due in part}} to phylogeny, as basal groups have smaller brains, less structural hypertrophy, and lower foliation indices, there is also substantial variation within and across clades that does not reflect phylogenetic relationships. Ecological correlations, with the relative development of different brain areas as well as the complexity of the cerebellar corpus, are supported by cluster analysis and are suggestive of a range of 2 ̆ 7 cerebrotypes 2 ̆ 7. These correlations suggest that relative brain development reflects the dimensionality of the environment and/or agile prey capture in addition to phylogeny...|$|R
5000|$|Saurornithoides is {{a member}} of the troodontids, a group of small, bird-like, [...] maniraptorans.

Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotients,</b> meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. Saurornithoides was a rather small troodontid. Though a possible adult, the type specimen has a midline skull length of 189 millimetres, compared to 272 millimetres for Zanabazar junior, itself estimated at 2.3 metres long. It had large eye sockets and stereoscopic vision, allowing for good depth perception. It probably had good vision in light and very good night vision. It had a long, low head, a depressed muzzle, sharp teeth and a relatively large brain. Swift and smart, like its North American cousin Troodon, Saurornithoides probably scoured the Gobi Desert, looking for small mammals or reptiles to eat. Like other troodontids, it had an enlarged retractable claw on the second toe of each foot, that in this case was of moderate size though rather curved.|$|R
40|$|We here {{describe}} the endocranial {{cast of the}} Eocene archaic ungulate Hyopsodus lepidus AMNH 143783 (Bridgerian, North America) reconstructed from X-ray computed microtomography data. This represents the first complete cranial endocast known for Hyopsodontinae. The Hyopsodus endocast is compared to other known "condylarthran" endocasts, i. e. those of Pleuraspidotherium (Pleuraspidotheriidae), Arctocyon (Arctocyonidae), Meniscotherium (Meniscotheriidae), Phenacodus (Phenacodontidae), {{as well as to}} basal perissodactyls (Hyracotherium) and artiodactyls (Cebochoerus, Homacodon). Hyopsodus presents one of the highest <b>encephalization</b> <b>quotients</b> of archaic ungulates and shows an "advanced version" of the basal ungulate brain pattern, with a mosaic of archaic characters such as large olfactory bulbs, weak ventral expansion of the neopallium, and absence of neopallium fissuration, as well as more specialized ones such as the relative reduction of the cerebellum compared to cerebrum or the enlargement of the inferior colliculus. As in other archaic ungulates, Hyopsodus midbrain exposure is important, but it exhibits a dorsally protruding largely developed inferior colliculus, a feature unique among "Condylarthra". A potential correlation between the development of the inferior colliculus in Hyopsodus and the use of terrestrial echolocation as observed in extant tenrecs and shrews is discussed. The detailed analysis of the overall morphology of the postcranial skeleton of Hyopsodus indicates a nimble, fast moving animal that likely lived in burrows. This would be compatible with terrestrial echolocation used by the animal to investigate subterranean habitat and/or to minimize predation during nocturnal exploration of the environment. © 2012 Orliac et al.
