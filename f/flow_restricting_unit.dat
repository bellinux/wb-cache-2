40|$|We {{show that}} C k Reeb {{deformations}} of Riemannian geodesic flows are C kΓ 1 conjugate to Finsler geodesic flows, k 3. One use of Finsler geodesic flows in dynamics {{is in the}} study of periodic solutions to Hamilton's equations (see, for example, [4]). Under some assumptions the restriction of a Hamiltonian flow to an eneregy level is a reparametrization of a Finsler geodesic <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> to its <b>unit</b> sphere bundle, and so one can in this situation use Finsler geometry to show the existence of closed orbits for the original Hamiltonian system on that energy level. Many dynamical properties, however, are altered by reparametrizations (topological entropy and Lyapunov exponents are examples) and so in these situations it is more desirable to know that one's flow is actually time-preservingly conjugate to a Finsler geodesic flow. Recall that a contact form on a 2 n Γ 1 -dimensional manifold is a 1 -form ` such that ` d` nΓ 1 is a volume form. Associated to a contact for [...] ...|$|R

Blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> resistance training {{has been shown to}} improve muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy in inclusion body myositis. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of a resistance training programme on the expression of genes related to myostatin (MSTN) signalling in one inclusion body myositis patient. Methods: A 65 -year-old man with inclusion body myositis underwent blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> resistance training for 12 weeks. The gene expression of MSTN, follistatin, follistatin-like 3, activin II B receptor, SMAD- 7, MyoD, FOXO- 3, and MURF- 2 was quantified. Results: After 12 weeks of training, a decrease (25 %) in MSTN mRNA level was observed, whereas follistatin and follistatin-like 3 gene expression increased by 40 % and 70 %, respectively. SMAD- 7 mRNA level was augmented (20 %). FOXO- 3 and MURF- 2 gene expression increased by 40 % and 20 %, respectively. No change was observed in activin II B receptor or MyoD gene expression. Conclusions: Blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> resistance training attenuated MSTN gene expression and also increased expression of myostatin endogenous inhibitors. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> resistance training evoked changes in the expression of genes related to MSTN signalling pathway that could in part explain the muscle hypertrophy previously observed in a patient with inclusion body myositis...|$|R

40|$|Five {{concepts}} {{for conservation}} of municipal water supply are analyzed {{from an economic}} efficiency perspectice. They include: 1) seasonal pricing (for reduction of peak period water use), 2) dual water systems (separate high quality drinking water and untreated outdoor irrigation systems), 3) imported water transmission facility capacity optimization, 4) <b>flow</b> <b>restricting</b> devices, and 5) short-term rationing concepts. Optimization models, including generalized model generators, were developed for analysis {{of the first three}} concepts and demonstrated by applications to cities in Utah. The <b>flow</b> <b>restricting</b> device and short-term rationsing concept analyses applied approaches taken from the literature to example sites in Utah. The final chapter is a comparison of results and summary of conditions which favor each approach to conservation. Conclusions include: Seasonal pricing was demonstarted to reduce peak period water use but is not justified in Salt Lake City because the added cost of metering exceeds the additional benefits. Dual water systems are potentially an important concept for matching various qualities of water with appropriate uses and producing net economic benefits. Determination of capacity of an imported water facility is dominated more by the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s attitude toward risk than by pricing policy. <b>Flow</b> <b>restricting</b> devices produce economic benefits only if the change in quality of service is ignored.

The piece is called periodic {{if there is}} a Seifert fibration so that a regular fiber is freely homotopic, up to powers, to a closed orbit of the flow.

In a previous paper [Ba-Fe 1] we described the structure of a pseudo-Anosov <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> to a periodic piece up to isotopy along the flow. In the present paper we consider free Seifert pieces. We show that, in a carefully defined neighborhood of the free piece, the pseudo-Anosov flow is orbitally equivalent to a hyperbolic blow up of a geodesic flow piece. A geodesic flow piece is a finite cover of the geodesic flow on a compact hyperbolic surface, usually with boundary. In the proof we introduce almost k-convergence groups and prove a convergence theorem. We also introduce an alternative model for the geodesic flow of a hyperbolic surface that is suitable to prove these results, and we carefully define what is a hyperbolic blow up...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We prove a {{dynamical}} trace {{formula for}} asymptotically hyperbolic (n+ 1) dimensional manifolds with negative (but not necessarily constant) sectional curvatures which equates the renormalized wave trace to the lengths of closed geodesics. This result generalizes the classical theorem of Duistermaat-Guillemin for compact manifolds {{and the results}} of [37], [38], and [58] for hyperbolic manifolds with infinite volume. A corollary of this dynamical trace formula is a Selberg trace formula for compact perturbations of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds which we use to prove a growth estimate for the length spectrum counting function. We then define a dynamical zeta function and prove its analyticity in a half plane. Based on the work of Eberlein [24], [25] and Eberlein-O’Neill [27] for complete open manifolds with negative sectional curvature known as “visibility manifolds ” we show that the geodesic <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> to the non-wandering set satisfies the hypotheses of Parry and Pollicott’s [56] Axiom A <b>flows</b> <b>restricted</b> to a basic set. We then apply their results to prove a prime orbit theorem for the geodesic flow.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} walk training combined with blood flow restriction (BFR) {{on the size of}} blood flow-restricted distal muscles, as well as, on the size of non-restricted muscles in the proximal limb and trunk. Nine men performed walk training with BFR and 8 men performed walk training alone. Training was conducted two times a day, 6 days/wk, for 3 wk using five sets of 2 -min bouts (treadmill speed at 50 m/min), with a 1 -min rest between bouts. After walk training with BFR, MRI-measured upper (3. 8 %, P < 0. 05) and lower leg (3. 2 %, P < 0. 05) muscle volume increased significantly, whereas the muscle volume of the gluteus maximus (- 0. 6 %) and iliopsoas (1. 8 %) and the muscle CSA of the lumber L 4 -L 5 (- 1. 0) did not change. There was no significant change in muscle volume in the walk training alone. Our results suggest that the combination of leg muscle blood flow restriction with slow walk training elicits hypertrophy only in the distal blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> leg muscles. Exercise intensity may be too low during BFR walk training to increase muscle mass in the non- blood <b>flow</b> <b>restricted</b> muscles (gluteus maximus and other trunk muscles) ...|$|R
