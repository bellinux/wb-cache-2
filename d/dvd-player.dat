40|$|Numerous {{academics}} and marketers are sceptical about {{the relevance of}} research on country-of-origin (coo) effects. This criticism {{is based on a}} series of studies suggesting that coo-cues are of no more than marginal importance as determinants of people's attitudes towards foreign-sourced products. More specifically, this criticism is directed towards studies focussing on the relevance of a coo's more general environmental conditions (like for instance its cultural identity, political climate, geography, religion, language, national history, etc.). Additionally, the theoretical status of the coo-field as a whole has frequently been questioned for its lack of solidity and transparency. Our study intends to put this situation into its proper context. Its main objective is to contribute to a better 'understanding' of coo-effects with special attention going to the role of a coo's more general environmental conditions as determinants of attitude formation towards products made abroad. A large-scale field survey was designed, questioning a Belgian student sample about their images of Spain and Denmark's environmental conditions. Also, participants were questioned about their images of Spanish/Danish beer (hedonic product) and <b>DVD-players</b> (utilitarian product). Hypotheses concerning the structure of country images and their role as potential determinants of attitude formation were developed based on semiotics (and more in particular based on Discourse Theory). Data were analyzed by means of Structural Equation Modeling (AMOS 5. 0). Results indicate first of all that images about Spanish/Danish country-related environmental conditions significantly contribute to the formation of attitudes towards Spanish/Danish beer and <b>DVD-players.</b> Secondly, these country images were found to be based on a hierarchically ordered tri-component structure. Thirdly, in line with Discourse Theory, it could be established how coo-effects are supported by composite mechanisms with country-related cognitions, feelings and conations operating simultaneously during product attitude formation. More in detail, effects generated by the country image's conative component were found to be strongest. Interestingly, country-related cognitions were more important for attitude formation towards <b>DVD-players</b> while country-specific feelings were more influential in case of beer.

40|$|Abstract — Digital Green is a {{research}} project that seeks to disseminate targeted agricultural information to small and marginal farmers in India using digital video. The unique components of Digital Green are (1) a participatory process for content production, (2) a locally generated digital video database, (3) human-mediated instruction for dissemination and training, and (4) regimented sequencing to initiate a new community. Unlike some systems that expect information or communication technology alone to deliver useful knowledge to marginal farmers, Digital Green works with existing, people-based extension systems and aims to amplify their effectiveness. While video provides a point of focus, it is people and social dynamics that ultimately make Digital Green work. Local social networks are tapped to connect farmers with experts; the thrill of appearing “on TV ” motivates farmers; and homophily is exploited to minimize the distance between teacher and learner. In a four-month trial involving 16 villages (1070 households), Digital Green was seen to increase adoption of certain agriculture practices {{by a factor of}} six to seven times over classical persononly agriculture extension. The hardware investment was a TV and a <b>DVD-player</b> per village, and one digital camera and PC shared among all 16 villages. These results are very preliminary, but promising.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Healthy eating {{practices}} are among important public health goals worldwide. We aimed to investigate socio-economic determinants of the nutrition habits of Ukrainian families. METHODS: Data from the “UKRAINIAN LONGITUDINAL MONITORING SURVEY 2007 ” were analysed. Factor analysis produced variables characterising eating practices, which were re-coded in binary variables indicating low/high food consumption. The bivariate and multivariate {{analysis was conducted}} to identify associations between socio-economic state and eating modes. RESULTS: Three dimensions of nutrition practices were identified in the factor analysis: “standard diet” variable associated with quantities of most food products consumed, it actually shows how much food in general the household consumes, “fruit-and-vegetable diet” variable was associated with quantities of various fruits and vegetables included in the questionnaire, and “processed-(pre-packed) -food diet” variable was created based on its associations with products like sausage. More “processed” food was consumed by members of households which were generally better-off (equipped with <b>dvd-player,</b> computer (laptop), garage), and Russian-speakers. More plant food was consumed by the households with attributes of rural living (equipped with bottled gas, central or individual system of heating, those who possessed a motorcycle or a truck). The owners of a plot adjacent to rural house or land used for gardening were eating more fruits and vegetables. A small group of well-off urban dwellers (like those possessing tumble-dryers), tend to eat more plant food; however, this group is not numerous. CONCLUSION: Plant food eating in Ukraine stays a factor of survival rather than healthy eating for those households which dwell in rural areas and have no means to choose foods they want. Those people who achieve better socio-economic status tend to increase processed food portion of their diets. Only a very small group of affluent Ukrainian citizens tend to eat much fruit and vegetables contributing to U-form relationship between socio-economic status and antioxidant-rich food consumption...|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} trends {{have marked}} {{the past three}} decennia. The first is the digitization of almost all information generated and consumed by modern society. One only has {{to think of the}} myriad of electronic devices that have penetrated into our personal lives, ranging from digital camera's, <b>DVD-players,</b> mp 3 -players, TVs, etc [...] . The second important trend was the liberation of our communication devices from their tethers. The convergence of IT technology and wireless communication was inevitable and the last five years of this decennium have seen an incredible push towards nomadic information devices. Information availability became a prime requirement for people ever since the advent of the Internet about 15 years ago. It had never been so easy to gather information about every aspect of life and on this scale. As years went by users were no longer content to access their information on a fixed terminal, which created a huge demand for wireless Internet access and mobile data processing devices. These devices are already embedded in our society, we only have to think about the multitude of smart phones, netbooks and the tablet PCs which are being introduced this year (2010). One of the main technological drivers for these nomadic information devices is increased data speed and flexibility in data access. There are already of whole set of wireless standards present in current devices supplying either wireless access or functionalities like sensing, e. g. WLAN, Bluetooth, 2 G, 3 G, GPS and there are even more lurking over the horizon (4 G/GALILEO,WiMAX, [...] .). Each of these standards requires a dedicated radio transmitter to receive and send data. The radio transmitter sends and receives electromagnetic waves within a certain frequency band and this requires dedicated components able to work on the frequency information of the signals, e. g. frequency generators (clocks) and bandpass filters. The filters and clocks, used in these radio transmitters, are subject to very stringent requirements, which could traditionally only be met by bulky and off-chip components. However the continuous demand for more functionality, smaller size and longer battery life is driving development of new and innovative ways to fabricate these frequency components. This is the area where this work fits in. In this thesis a micro-mechanical component will be studied, which offers the possibility to realize very accurate reference clocks as well as very linear and sharp bandpass filters. Moreover, these components allow monolithic integration on top of CMOS chips, paving the way for compact, low-power and low-cost applications. The goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility of high-frequency CMOS compatible MEMS-resonators fabricated with a silicon-germanium structural layer. This thesis will start by theoretically analyzing the behavior of a mechanical resonators. New contributions in this chapter include analytical models for the electromechanical behavior of the resonator, anchor losses and analytical solutions for arbitrarily shaped resonators. In the next chapter of this thesis the process flow for the resonators will be presented. The focus will be put on two process modules for creating high-aspect ratio narrow trenches, which are essential to fabricate high frequency resonators. The followingchapter presents a study of silicon-germanium as a structural material for micromechanical resonators. An extensive study was done to evaluate and identify the intrinsic acoustical losses in silicon-germanium as these losses have an important impact on the device performance. The thesis finishes with a study of different resonator topologies and introduces an alternative use for micromechanical resonators asintegrated radiation sensors. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{is a physical}} process in which energy is exchanged. It occurs in numerous applications, such as production of electricity, building climatisation, food preparation, [...] . Since energy consumption has increased tremendously in the last decades and this trend will continue, the concept of energy efficiency has become omnipresent. In electronics miniaturization has become a trend. Desktops, laptops, <b>dvd-players,</b> mp 3 -players, televisions, [...] . are getting thinner and/or smaller. Together {{with the increase in}} work speed and capacity, these small dimensions cause the energy density of electronic components (chips, processors,...) to intensify significantly. As the electric power supply for these components is converted into heat, the component temperature rises. Hence, large amount of electricity are dissipated in a small surface area and cause high heat fluxes in the electronic components. To prevent overheating (and therefore failure) of electronic components, efficient heat removal is necessary. A cheap and almost universally applicable method for the cooling of electronics uses air as coolant in combination with a heat sink. The heat sinks are placed on the electronic component in order to distribute the heat and to create a better heat transfer. A heat sink mostly consists of longitudinal fins. Fin shape adjustments can improve the heat transfer, without the need for an increase in fin volume. This dissertation is specifically aimed at the research on longitudinal fins. It takes off looking for a measurement method to determine the performance of longitudinal fins as well as possible performance improvements by adjustments to these fins. The developed technique offers a global examination with a performance parameter. Moreover, it creates the possibility to study local heat transfer effects. In this work, the technique is applied to longitudinal fins, specifically fins for the cooling of electronics, but can be extended to other fin types. Chapter one also provides a summary of previous research on longitudinal fins. The number of studies on local heat transfer coefficients is limited and these studies are often inaccurate. A study of different fin performance indicators was also made, which indicated that the widely spread concept of fin efficiency is misleading, and a bad fin performance indicator. Nevertheless, many studies still aim for the highest possible fin efficiency, assuming this would guarantee the maximum heat transfer. A better, more reliable fin performance parameter is the fin effectiveness, or the performance ratio which is derived from it. As high fin effectiveness actually corresponds to a higher heat transfer, fin effectiveness was used as the fin performance indicator in this work. The developed measurement technique should not only be able to determine local heat transfer coefficients, it should also measure the fin effectiveness. To attain those goals, one has to determine the heat flux distribution in the fin. Normally, one does not measure heat fluxes, but temperatures, that make it possible to calculate the heat flux distribution. This requires a technique to accurately measure temperature profiles, and a numerical method to calculate the heat flux distribution from these measurements. This numerical method is developed in the second chapter. Determining heat fluxes from temperatures is known as the inverse heat conduction problem. This kind of problem is solved inversely. Whereas in a direct problem heat fluxes are imposed as boundary conditions and the temperature field is calculated from these conditions, in an inverse conduction problem the solution (temperature field) is known and the boundary conditions (heat fluxes) are determined from these temperatures. An introducing literature survey indicates that the inverse conduction problem is ill-posed and that it therefore can have several solutions. To obtain stable, physically correct solutions, mathematical methods are used. The second chapter offers a summary of the solution methods found in literature, which are all based on the minimization of a temperature functional. The inverse heat conduction problem studied in this work is three-dimensional, linear and steady state. Based on the summary of the different numerical techniques the most suitable methods are chosen. Two methods are taken into consideration: the steepest descent method (SDM) and the conjugate gradient method (CGM). Chapter two mathematically develops both of these similar techniques and writes the complete solution algorithm for both of them. These two solution algorithms are applied to some numerical test cases in chapter 3. The test cases consist of a rectangular longitudinal fin that partly covers a flat primary surface. Different heat transfer coefficient profiles are imposed on the fin walls and the primary surface. Using these boundary conditions, the temperature profiles on the same surfaces are calculated. These temperature profiles are considered as exact temperature measurements and are the boundary conditions for the inverse heat conduction problem. This inverse heat conduction problem is solved with both SDM and CGM. Afterwards, chapter three investigates the influence of measurement errors on the measured temperature profiles for two different measurement accuracies: 0. 1 °C and 0. 5 °C. Apparently SDM and CGM have a comparable accuracy, but CGM converges much faster. The introduction of measurement errors gives comparable results as in the ideal case of exact temperature measurements. Only at the edges the deviations increase significantly. Enlarging the measurement error from 0. 1 °C to 0. 5 °C does not lead to the expected drastic decrease in accuracy of the estimated profiles. The results are even comparable to the exact results. This indicates that the solution methods are not too sensitive to noise and thus suitable to process experimental measurement data. Relying on the results, CGM was chosen as solution method because of the faster convergence rate. Chapter 4 develops a measurement method using infrared thermography as measurement technique. Infrared thermography has the advantage that it is a noncontacting method. Thus the temperature field and measurement object are not disturbed by the measurement. Moreover, thermography makes it possible to get complete temperature profiles with a single measurement. The first part of the chapter explains some basic notions on radiation and thermography. Calibration methods are drawn up and applied. An error analysis is executed on the parameters that determine the incident radiation energy and on the camera specific properties, resulting in an uncertainty for the measured temperature values. The second part of the chapter explains the measurement setup. First the dimensions of the studied fins are determined based on the Reynolds analogy and on data from literature. Subsequently, the composition of the experimental setup is described. A low speed wind tunnel is used to set the environmental conditions and vary the Reynlods number (Re), which allows examining the influence of Re on the fin effectiveness and local heat transfer coefficients. A heat source is placed {{at the bottom of the}} fin, in combination with a guard heater to limit uncontrolled temperature losses. The power of the heat source is based on the fin temperature that should be attained to perform the most accurate temperature measurements with the infrared camera. The end of the chapter presents the different fin forms that will be studied: solid rectangular longitudinal fins and perforated fins with various numbers of perforations. The final chapter accomplishes the data reduction and presents the results. The temperature images, measured with the infrared camera during the experiments, are converted to a matrix with temperature values. This matrix can be used as a boundary condition for the inverse heat conduction problem that is solved with the developed solution method based on CGM. This solution makes it possible to determine the local heat fluxes and fin effectivenesss. The results obtained for the rectangular longitudinal fins agree with data from literature. The local heat transfer coefficients indicate the expected trends, and even show the influence of a horseshoe vortex at the base of the fin. The results for the perforated fins show the influence of the perforations and of restarting the boundary layer: after a perforation higher local heat transfer coefficients are found. The comparison with values from literature confirms the obtained results. The results for fin effectiveness are not accurate enough to draw conclusions for this. To conclude, chapter 6 presents the most important findings and perspectives for future work...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{semiconductors}} {{have become increasingly}} important for many technological applications due to their intriguing electronic properties. As an example, the conductivity of a semiconductors rises with increasing temperature which is opposite to the observations in metals. It is possible to modify the conductivity by the selective introduction of impurities. This so called doping allows for designing devices with well defined conduction properties like for example diodes or transistors. The invention of latter ones {{has been an important}} step in the development of modern computers. Unfortunately, the same physical processes that allow to design the electronic characteristics make semiconductor properties very sensitive to undesired impurities such that Wolfgang Pauli called semiconductor physics "dirt physics" in the 1920 s. Today, modern epitaxy techniques allow to grow high-quality semiconductor devices with growth accuracies of one single atomic monolayer and a minimum of impurities. The origin of the interesting electronic properties of semiconductors is their special band structure. In contrast to conductors and similar to insulators, semiconductors have a filled valence band and an empty conduction band in the ground state. These bands are energetically separated by the band-gap energy. Compared to insulators, the band-gap energy is small (on the order of 1 eV) such that electrons can be excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The missing electrons in the valence band are often called holes and treated like quasi-particles that have opposite charge, spin and free-particle mass compared to the excited electrons. Depending on the structure of the semiconductor device and the environmental conditions, the electrons in the conduction band may act like the free electrons of a conductor and thus contribute to the conductivity. "Über Halbleiter sollte man nicht arbeiten, das ist eine Schweinerei, wer weiß ob es überhaupt Halbleiter gibt. " Besides the intriguing electronic properties, semiconductor heterostructure have remarkable optical properties due to their band-gap energy that often corresponds to photon energies in the visible regime. Thus, visible light may be used to excite electrons in semiconductors and the opposite process may lead to the emission of visible light. These processes are widely used in applications of particular economical importance like light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes or solid state lasers. In the year 2006, more than 800 million laser diodes have been sold worldwide, making semiconductor optics a multi-billion Dollar market. Today, we find optical semiconductor devices in a multitude of applications including <b>DVD-players,</b> laser pointers, optical fibers, laser printers, bar-code readers, in medical apparatuses or in the laser surgery and the measurement technology. At present, more and more electric light-bulbs and even neon lamps are replaced by LEDs that have a higher energy efficiency. On top of that, LEDs are relatively cheap in production and show a long durability. Since the emission properties of LEDs strongly depend on the exact structure and material of the LED, a huge effort is made to find new LED structures with improved light-emission characteristics. Often, LEDs contain low dimensional heterostructures like quantum-wells (QWs) or quantum wires that are embedded inside a complicated dielectric environment. Due to their reduced dimensionality, QWs and quantum wires exhibit a strong electron confinement in one or two dimensions, respectively. Thus in these systems, the density of states is different from that of a three-dimensional semiconductor crystal such that electrons in QWs generally behave different from those in a three-dimensional crystal. Silicon is perhaps the best known semiconductor material since it is the basis of most electronic semiconductor devices. Due to the long technological experience with that material, silicon is also the material that can be created with the highest purity. It is highly desirable to grow laser structures on a silicon basis because a laser based on silicon would establish new possibilities in combining optical and electronic properties in semiconductor devices. Unfortunately, silicon is an indirect band-gap semiconductor such that it cannot be used as the optically active region in laser structures. Moreover, even the growth of a laser on a silicon basis is very difficult because materials that could act as optically active regions introduce strain and other disturbances due their different lattice constants. Thus, the development of a laser based on silicon is extremely difficult. As a consequence, it is interesting to investigate the microscopic processes in indirect semiconductors preventing them from being applicable for laser structures. An important question in this context is whether there is a regime in which lasing from indirect semiconductors is possible. Thus, we will discuss this question in this thesis. Apart from the intriguing electronic and light-emission properties, semiconductors heterostructure are also an excellent material in which the quantum nature of many-particle interactions may be investigated. In this context, a lot of research has been done on quasi-particles. Examples for such quasi-particles are phonons, excitons and polaritons where phonons describe the quantized lattice vibrations. Excitons are Coulomb-bound electron-hole pairs and polaritons describe a coupled photon-exciton system which appears in semiconductor cavities. Many {{attempts have been made to}} create Bose-Einstein condensates of these quasi-particles. In the literature there is still a controversy about whether these condensates have been created and if it is possible at all to create such condensates. The reason of this disagreement is the underlying fermionic sub-structure of the excitons that makes them non-ideal bosonic particles. In this work, it will be shown that under incoherent emission conditions it is possible to create an exciton condensate in multiple-quantum-well (MQW) systems. Another exciton property that complicates the creation of an exciton condensate and the investigation of excitons in general is that in QWs excitons with vanishing center-of-mass momentum exhibit a fast recombination on a 10 -picosecond (ps) time scale. Thus, a condensate that consists of these quasi-particles vanishes on the same time scale. For this reason, it is desirable to find exciton-friendly conditions that allow for an enhanced exciton lifetime. In this work, the influence of a MQW structure on the exciton lifetime will be investigated. The recombination of the excitons causes incoherent emission, i. e. photoluminescence (PL). For a long time, it was widely believed that exciton resonances in PL spectra indicate the presence of excitons. This was questioned when calculations showed that an unbound electron-hole plasma leads to the same emission peaks. By contrast, it could be shown that terahertz absorption corresponding to transitions between different exciton states is a unique signature of excitons in the system. However, in contrast to PL, terahertz absorption cannot distinguish between excitons with different center of mass momenta and thus terahertz cannot be used to decide whether excitons are present in the from of an condensate. Additionally, a strategy has been developed that allows to determine whether the PL originates from excitons or electron-hole plasma such that the PL remains an important tool to characterize the quantum state of an excited semiconductor heterostructures. Another interesting field of research is the excitation of semiconductors with light sources that have various quantum statistics. Each quantum statistic excites a characteristic quantum state in the semiconductors. These states often have intriguing properties. As an example, light sources with a special quantum statistics are used in the field of quantum computing where a defined emission of photons and entanglement are needed. Two examples for light sources that exhibit differing light statistics are the emission from a laser and the emission from a thermal light source. The laser emission is phase coherent which means that all photons carry the same phase. The origin of this coherence is the stimulated-emission process that causes the amplification in the optically active region of a laser. During this process, a photon induces the recombination of an electron-hole pair and at the same time the emission of a photon that carries the same phase as the original photon. Due to the phase coherence, the laser light carries a classical electric field such that a macroscopic polarization is induced when the laser pulse hits a QW. In contrast to the laser light, the emission from a thermal light source is caused by spontaneous emission and thus is entirely incoherent. That means that each photon carries a random phase such that the macroscopic electric field vanishes. Thus, the electric field of thermal light is fully determined by its quantum fluctuations. As a consequence, thermal light does not induce a macroscopic polarization such that the excited quantum state inside the QW is dominated by the quantum-mechanical corrections, the so called correlations. For the description of the light-matter interaction of a QW in the coherent excitation regime, the semiconductor Bloch equation (SBE) are used. The incoherent regime is described by the semiconductor luminescence equations (SLE). Both sets of equations are able to treat the Coulomb interaction and, if desired, the phonon interaction on a microscopical level beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. Thus, both theories, SBE and SLE, are able to describe and explain a great variety of effects. In principle it is even possible to couple SBE and SLE. The resulting theory is able to describe interactions between coherent and incoherent processes and explains for example the secondary emission. In this work, we investigate both, the coherent and the incoherent light-emission regime. Thus in Chap. 2, we define the investigated system and introduce the many-body Hamiltonian that describes consistently the light-matter interaction in the classical and the quantum limit. In Chap. 3, we introduce the SBE that allow to compute the light-matter interaction in the coherent scenario. In this context, we review the carrier scattering in Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and extend the scattering model such that we can also describe scattering in indirect Germanium (Ge) QWs. The extended scattering model is used to investigate the absorption of a Ge QW for different time delays after the excitations. In this context, we analyze whether there is a regime in which optical gain can be realized. In Chap. 4, we apply a transfer-matrix method to include into our calculations the influence of the dielectric environment on the optical response. It is shown how the microscopic description of the QW via the SBE can be incorporated into the transfer-matrix calculations. This coupled theory, enables us to describe reflection, transmission and absorption of a QW that is embedded inside a complicated dielectric structure. The SLE for a MQW system are introduced in Chap. 5. It is shown how the PL is described by the SLE and that the information about the dielectric environment enter the SLE in a non-trivial manner. In Chap. 6, we derive a scheme that allows for decoupling environmental effects from the pure PL-emission properties of the QW. We describe the influence of the dielectric environment via a structure-dependent filter function. The PL of the actual QW system is obtained by multiplying this filter function and the free-space PL that describes the quantum emission into a medium with spatially constant background-refractive index. We investigate the validity of this approximation for different coupling situations. In Chap. 7, it is studied how the MQW-Bragg structure influences the PL-emission properties compared to the emission of a single QW device. The relation between the PL and the exciton lifetime is analyzed and conditions are determined that lead to a maximum lifetime enhancement. As a last feature, it is shown that the QW coupling leads to the build-up of an exciton condensate even when the QWs are initially only excited with an uncorrelated electron-hole plasma...|$|R
