[...] If the mill no longer had to be remote, it became a problem that the mill was tied to the apprentices. [...] Apprentices had to be housed clothed and fed whether or not the mill could sell what they produced; they were in competition with free children whose wages would fall if the mill went on short time (and might not reflect the full cost of housing clothing and feeding them, since that was incurred whether they were working or not) and who could be discharged if sick, injured or otherwise incapable of work. [...] Consequently, the use of free children came to predominate: the Act became largely a dead letter within its limited scope, and inapplicable to most factory children.|$|E

OSH offers a risk free and safe working environment with influence on productivity and as such Ws imperative for construction firms to provide and ensure compliance by all workers particularly casual workers. The study sought tofind out the perspective of casual workers on the compliance to occupational health and safety (OHS) practice in the Ghanaian construction industry as well as sustainable OSH strategies to improve the compliance level of casual workers. A structured interview questionnaire survey was used to collect data from casual workers on selected construction sites in Ghana. The study revealed a poor compliance to basic OHS regulations by casual workers. This was attributed to; unsafe attitudes and behaviour less education on health and safety 1 inadequate supply of personal protective equipment 1 less supervision and improper use of tools and equipment. Recommendation are made for the empowerment of the <b>factories</b> <b>inspectorate</b> and labour departments to effectively undertake their mandate under the law 1 the merger of all occupational safety and health policy documents into one single document is recommended and finally the passage of the construction industry bill to help regulate ensure strict compliance by industry players in the implementation of projects. In conclusion, strict compliance to OHS practice of casual workers should be ensured through close supervision at site; thus wearing a PPE must be a pre-requisite to access to site, safety education for workers should be undertaken as well as ensuring that occupational safety and health safety compliance declaration be considered a basic contractual requirement for the award of projects (at least for government of Ghanafunded projects) ...|$|R

The chief objects {{of the law of}} 1887 were to secure payment in full to all workers, other than those in agriculture or domestic service, of wages in legal tender, to prohibit payment of wages in public-houses, and to secure prompt payment of wages. Certain deductions were permitted under careful control for specific customary objects: lodging, use of land, uniforms, food, firing. A royal order of the Loth of October 1903 required use of automatic indicators for estimating wages in certain cases in textile processes. The law of 15 June 1896 regulates the affixing in workplaces, where at least five workers are employed, of a notice of the working rules, the nature and rate of fines, if any, and the mode of their application. Two central services the mines <b>inspectorate</b> and the <b>factory</b> and workshop <b>inspectorate,</b> divide the duties above indicated.

5000|$|The {{enforcement}} of UK Factory Acts before that of 1833 {{had been left}} to local magistrates, which had meant that any compliance with those acts within the cotton industry to which they applied was effectively voluntary. The initial role of the <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> was to ensure compliance with the limits on age and working hours for children in the cotton industry, thus protecting them from overwork and injury. Four factory inspectors were appointed, with powers equivalent to a magistrate, the right to enter at will any cotton mill at work, and powers to introduce regulations (without Parliamentary approval) to effectively implement the Factory Act. [...] The inspectors were assisted by 'superintendents', who had none of their powers (the lack of a right of entry being a particular weakness). By the Factory Act of 1844 the superintendents became 'sub-inspectors' with the right of entry at will. By the same Act, the inspectors lost their magisterial powers {{and the right to}} make regulations was transferred to the Home Secretary a duty to guard machinery was laid on employers (but only where the machinery was in areas accessed by children or young persons), the <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> therefore becoming concerned with the adequacy of machine guarding.|$|E

[...] Ashley was then instrumental in obtaining a Royal Commission on the employment of children in mines and manufactures, which eventually reported in 1842 (mines) and 1843 (manufactures): two of the four Commissioners had served on the 1833 Factory Commission; the other two were serving factory inspectors.|$|E

The consequent Factory Act of 1833 and its establishment of the UK <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> is often taken to mark the start of modern/effective factory legislation in the UK.

For Example, In Glossop, there were 931 children (out of 3562) between 5 and thirteen working in cotton mills.

Below these schools, there could be, for Dissenters, day schools associated with their place of worship - although often described in their locality as 'British' schools they were not formally so and in most cases the quality of education given was in no way comparable.

50|$|In {{virtually}} every {{debate on the}} various Factories Bills, opponents had thought it a nonsense to pass legislation for textile mills when {{the life of a}} mill child was much preferable to that of many other children: other industries were more tiring, more dangerous, more unhealthy, required longer working hours, involved more unpleasant working conditions, or (this being Victorian Britain) were more conducive to lax morals. This logic began to be applied in reverse once {{it became clear that the}} Ten Hours Act had had no obvious detrimental effect on the prosperity of the textile industry or on that of millworkers. Acts were passed bringing other textile trades within the scope of the Factories Act : bleaching and dyeworks (1860 - outdoor bleaching was excluded), lace work (1861), calendering (1863), finishing (1864). In 1864 the Factories Extension Act was passed: this extended the Factories Act to cover a number of occupations (mostly non-textile): potteries (both heat and exposure to lead glazes were issues), lucifer match making ('phossie jaw') percussion cap and cartridge making, paper staining and fustian cutting. In 1867 the Factories Act was extended to all establishments employing 50 or more workers by another Factories Act Extension Act. An Hours of Labour Regulation Act applied to 'workshops' (establishments employing less than 50 workers); it subjected these to requirements similar to those for 'factories' (but less onerous on a number of points e.g.: the hours within which the permitted hours might be worked were less restrictive, there was no requirement for certification of age) but was to be administered by local authorities, rather than the <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b>|$|E
50|$|In certain {{scheduled}} unhealthy industries, where {{certificates of}} authorization from local authorities must {{be obtained by}} intending occupiers, conditions of health and safety for workers can be laid down in the certificate. The Minister of the Interior is empowered to draw up regulations prohibiting or making conditions for the employment of young workers or women in dangerous or unhealthy industries. The provisions against truck cover not only all industrial workers engaged in manual labour under a contract with an employer, but also shopassistants; the special regulations against fines and deductions apply to factory workers and shops where at least 20 workers are employed. In mines under the law of 1884, which supplements the general mining law, employment of women and girls underground is prohibited; boys from 12 to 16 and girls from 12 to 18 may only be employed at light work above ground; 14 is the earliest age of admission for boys underground. The shifts from bank to bank must not exceed 12 hours, of which not more than to may be effective work. Sunday rest must begin not later than 6 A.M., and must be of 24 hours' duration. These last two provisions do not hold in case of pressing danger for safety, health or property. Sick and accident funds and mining associations are legislated for in minutest detail. The general law provides for safety in working, but special rules drawn up by the district authorities lay down in detail the conditions of health and safety. As regards manufacturing industry, the Industrial Code lays no obligation on employers to report accidents, and until the Accident Insurance Law of 1889 came into force no statistics were available.

5000|$|Hindley was a 'voluntarist', {{holding that}} the state should {{have nothing to do}} with {{religious}} matters; consequently he called for disestablishment of the Church of England and removal of all its privileges, but also objected to state support of non-conformists (e.g. the Regium Donum [...] ) and Catholics (e.g. the Maynooth grant). He objected to the mal-organisation of the Church (this was particularly evident on Tameside: the living of Ashton, worth £1200 a year, was held by a rector permanently resident in Oxfordshire, his duties being performed by curates; Stalybridge's parish church was in Stockport, eight miles away) but made no criticism of its doctrines. He was a generous contributor to the subscription to erect an Anglican church in Stalybridge; when one was built he presented it with a set of Communion plate.On education, he initially held {{that the state}} should not be involved (since education must include religious education). Consequently, he was prominent in the opposition to Graham's Factory Education Bill of 1843, although (unlike other opponents such as Edward Baines Junior) he did not contradict the picture painted by the <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> of the failure of voluntarism to deliver [...] "efficient" [...] education to the factory children of Ashton, noting only that the Inspectorate showed that the voluntary efforts of the Dissenters had achieved more than the state church. On the defeat of Graham's Bill, he threw himself into efforts to raise money to build and support denominational schools on voluntarist principles, [...] donating generously himself. By 1847, however, whilst his fundraising had met an enthusiastic response, raising over £120,000 for Congregational schools, he could no longer believe that the voluntary principle was sufficient for the education of the people, and objected only to the details, rather than the principle, of that year's Education Bill.|$|E
5000|$|The Factory Acts were {{a series}} of UK labour law Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to {{regulate}} the conditions of industrial employment. The early Acts concentrated on regulating the hours of work and moral welfare of young children employed in cotton mills but were effectively unenforced until the Act of 1833 established a professional <b>Factory</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> The regulation of working hours was then extended to women by an Act of 1844. An Act in 1847 (the Ten Hour Act) (together with Acts in 1850 and 1853 remedying defects in the 1847 Act) met a long- standing (and by 1847 well-organised) demand by the millworkers for a ten-hour day. The Factory Acts also sought to ameliorate {{the conditions under which}} mill-children worked with requirements on ventilation, sanitation, and guarding of machinery. Introduction of the ten-hour day proved to have none of the dire consequences predicted by its opponents, and its apparent success effectively ended theoretical objections to the principle of factory legislation; from the 1860s onwards more industries were brought within the Factory Act, until by 1910, Sidney Webb reviewing the cumulative effect of century of factory legislation felt able to writeThe system of regulation which began with the protection of the tiny class of pauper apprentices in textile mills now includes within its scope every manual worker in every manufacturing industry. From the hours of labour and sanitation, the law has extended to the age of commencing work, protection against accidents, mealtimes and holidays, the methods of remuneration, and in the United Kingdom {{as well as in the}} most progressive of English-speaking communities, to the rate of wages itself. The range of Factory Legislation has, in fact, in one country or another, become co-extensive with the conditions of industrial employment. No class of manual-working wage-earners, no item in the wage-contract, no age, no sex, no trade or occupation, is now beyond its scope. This part, at any rate, of Robert Owen's social philosophy has commended itself to the practical judgment of the civilised world. It has even, though only towards the latter part of the nineteenth century, converted the economists themselves -converted them now to a [...] " [...] legal minimum wage [...] " [...] — and the advantage of Factory Legislation is now as soundly [...] " [...] orthodox [...] " [...] among the present generation of English, German, and American professors as [...] " [...] laisser-faire [...] " [...] was to their predecessors. ...
