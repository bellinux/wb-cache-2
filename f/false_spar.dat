2500|$|The Veltro was a wooden, {{shoulder}} wing cantilever monoplane, with a [...] span wing which was straight tapered in plan {{and had an}} aspect ratio of 18:1. [...] Its wing was constructed around a main box spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces, with a central panel [...] long. [...] The wing was skinned with [...] thick plywood, apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped balsa wood glued to a forward <b>false</b> <b>spar.</b> The trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing, lift increasing devices {{to increase the speed}} range and at higher angles (>60°) acted as airbrakes. [...] The wing tips were fitted with tip bodies [...] long and [...] in diameter.|$|E
50|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft {{constructed and}} skinned largely from duralumin. Its five part high wing was straight tapered to elliptical tips {{and had an}} aspect ratio of over 9, high for the time. It had a single spar at one third chord which tapered uniformly in depth outwards along the span and was reinforced with duralumin trellising. The leading edge formed a subsidiary box spar and the trailing edge had dural tube ribs and formed a <b>false</b> <b>spar</b> for high aspect ratio ailerons, which occupied about half the span.|$|E
50|$|The Couzinet 101 had a one piece, low, {{cantilever}} wing, constructed {{entirely from}} wood, {{with a single}} spar which ran from tip to tip and a rear <b>false</b> <b>spar</b> interrupted by the cabin. It was plywood-skinned and thick at the root but thinned progressively outboard from below, providing a little dihedral. Chord was also large at the root, where the wing was generously faired into the fuselage. The plan became trapezoidal outboard with long, approximately elliptical tips. The straight part of the trailing edges were filled with long, narrow-chord ailerons carrying ground-adjustable trim tabs.|$|E
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>spars,</b> like main spars, are {{load bearing}} {{structural}} members running spanwise {{but are not}} joined to the fuselage. Their most common purpose is to carry moving surfaces, principally ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The Pander D had {{a single}} piece, two spar wing which was {{attached}} to the upper fuselage longerons with pairs of yoked U-bolts. The spars were of the box type with spruce flanges and plywood webs, the front one forming a narrow chord D-box with ply covering around the wing leading edge. Aft of the front spar, the wing and ailerons, the latter mounted on <b>false</b> <b>spars,</b> were fabric covered. Similar methods were used in the tail structure.|$|R
2500|$|The Wee Bee was a high-wing monoplane, its aerodynamically thick wing divided at {{the centre}} and braced, {{close to the}} fuselage, by pairs of {{parallel}} struts to the lower longerons. [...] The wings were of two spar construction with plywood skinning between the two spars {{out as far as}} the bracing; outboard, only the leading edges were plywood covered, with fabric elsewhere. [...] The outboard ailerons were mounted on <b>false</b> <b>spars</b> as usual. In plan, the wings were almost rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 5.5.|$|R
50|$|The AK3 is {{the third}} two-seat, single engine, low wing design from André Kieger. It is {{produced}} by Junkers Profly France and is alternatively known as the Junkers Profly Junka UL. The wing has a single spar with a plywood leading edge and a <b>false</b> <b>spar</b> for the mounting of ailerons and flaps. Production aircraft have small winglets. Each wing is fixed to the fuselage {{with a pair of}} sailplane style pins for rapid demounting. The fuselage is built around four longerons, giving it a square lower section; the upper fuselage is rounded and merges into the line of the large perspex canopy over the side-by-side seating. The tailplane is mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin is swept; both are plywood structures. There are horn balances on elevators and rudder.|$|E
5000|$|The Veltro was a wooden, {{shoulder}} wing cantilever monoplane, with a 15 m span wing which was straight tapered in plan {{and had an}} aspect ratio of 18:1. [...] Its wing was constructed around a main box spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces, with a central panel 7.0 m long. [...] The wing was skinned with 2 mm thick plywood, apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped balsa wood glued to a forward <b>false</b> <b>spar.</b> The trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing, lift increasing devices {{to increase the speed}} range and at higher angles (>60°) acted as airbrakes. [...] The wing tips were fitted with tip bodies 700 mm long and 120 mm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{all of the}} Waco Custom Cabins were {{powered by}} radial engines (there being one factory-built exception, the MGC-8) and the {{purchaser}} could specify almost any commercially available engine and Waco would build an aircraft powered by it, hence the profusion of designations, as the first letter indicates the engine installed. Some models were offered in case someone wanted a specific engine but not all were built. Fuselage structure was typical for the period, being welded steel tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in. The wings were made of spruce with two spars each, having ailerons on only the upper wings, mounted on a <b>false</b> <b>spar.</b> Split flaps were installed on the undersides of the upper wings, though two designs were used depending on model - placed either mid-chord (OC, UC and QC), or in the conventional position at {{the trailing edge of}} the wing (GC and N). The model N was unusual in being the only model with flaps on the lower wings while the model E was the only one with plain flaps. Wing bracing was with a heavily canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, except on the E series which replaced the single strut with flying and landing wires. Elevators and rudder were aerodynamically counterbalanced and braced with wire cables. Both could be trimmed, the rudder via a ground-adjustable tab, the elevators via jack screw on the OC, UC and QC, while the GC, E and N used a single trim tab on the port (left) elevator. The main landing gear was sprung with oleo struts, and a castoring tailwheel was fitted on all versions except the VN model, which had a nosewheel.|$|E
50|$|The Hydroplum II is an unequal span, single bay biplane with V-from interplane struts. The fabric covered {{wings are}} again of {{constant}} chord and square tipped, though the lower wing has wing tip, retractable floats. The upper wing spoilers were {{moved from the}} main spar to the trailing edge, mounted on <b>false</b> <b>spars.</b> The fuselage was widened to accommodate two side-by-side in an open cockpit and refined aft, under a revised pylon which now rose from a rounded, raised upper fairing. The tailplane was raised to above the boom and the tailwheel undercarriage of the Hydroplum replaced with tricycle gear. The Hydroplum II {{is powered by a}} 48 kW (65 hp) Rotax 532 flat-twin.|$|R
50|$|The Stomo 3 was an all wood aircraft, {{designed}} to be simple to build without specialist tools and to have low capital and running costs, together with good performance and aerobatic capability. Its low wing was in three parts: a 1.80 m centre section with anhedral, improving the wing root aerodynamics, and outer panels with about 6° of dihedral, producing the inverted gull wing. Structurally, the single spar centre section {{was an integral part}} of the plywood-skinned fuselage and cockpit and the outer panels were also built around single spars and wooden ribs, with ply-covered leading edges back to the spars and fabric covered aft. Each wing was trapezoidal in plan, with sweep only on the leading edges and with rounded tips. Short, broad ailerons were placed at the tips and mounted on <b>false</b> <b>spars,</b> as were the inboard split flaps.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the cable}} single metal chairs hang at regular intervals. The cable, {{supported}} by 49 towers, climbs to its top station on a <b>false</b> summit between <b>Spar</b> and Keno gulches, approximately 10480 ft in elevation, 2540 ft above the base.|$|R
25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered torsion box leading edge, mainspar, ribs and <b>false</b> rear <b>spar</b> {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; AirSpeed Indicator (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an artificial horizon with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (oxygen equipment was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|R
5000|$|The unusual {{appearance}} of the Parnall Imp was entirely due to its wings, for it was otherwise a conventional two-seat, single-engined biplane of its time. Harold Bolas stated that he designed them to be simple and to allow the best possible view from {{either of the two}} cockpits. The simplicity came from the complete absence of the rigging wires that braced conventional biplanes and needed constant attention. Instead, the Imp had a cantilever lower wing which had not only to support itself but also most of the forces on the upper wing. These lower wings were unswept and rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 4.9, though the ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edge and about 40% of the chord. Since as cantilevers they had to be internally braced, the airfoil section was fairly thick, a variation on RAF31. Rather than the usual (in Britain) double-spar and rib construction, Bolas used multiple spanwise stringers or <b>false</b> <b>spars,</b> with longitudinal formers or airfoil shaped ribs, the whole covered in stress-bearing spruce veneer. [...] This stressed skin chiefly carried the bending loads. The Imp was a single-bay biplane, with a single, strongly outward-leaning wide chord streamlined strut on each side, connecting the centre of the lower wing to the upper one. [...] Though the upper wing was not a cantilever, it was constructed {{in the same way as}} the lower and joined to the fuselage from below at mid wing with a pair of N-shaped cabane struts. This upper wing was also straight and parallel-edged, with the same chord as the lower one, but greater in span and strongly swept at about 14.5o. [...] As a result, the leading edge at the centre was above the engine bulkhead, and the trailing edge at the tips beyond and aft of those of the lower plane. With the assistance of a large cutout in the trailing edge, this arrangement provided a clear upward view from both cockpits.The wings did not fold, but two people could dismantle both sets in about two minutes, first unclipping the bottom of the interplane strut, folding it and unhooking the centre section from the cabane for each upper wing in turn. The absence of ailerons on the upper plane simplified this procedure. The lower wings could then be detached with the release of catches and the removal of pins.|$|R
40|$|Wing joint {{design is}} one of the most {{critical}} areas in aircraft structures. Efficient and damage tolerant wing-fuselage integration structure, applicable to the next generation of transport aircraft, will facilitate the realisation of the benefits offered by new aircraft concepts. The Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft concept represents a potential revolution in subsonic transport efficiency for large airplanes. Studies have shown the BWB to be superior to conventional airframes in all key measures. Apart from the aerodynamic advantages, the BWB aircraft also provides a platform for wing-fuselage design changes. The main objective of this research is to design a damage tolerant wing-fuselage joint with a novel bird’s mouth termination for a BWB aircraft that has a similar payload range to the B 767 aircraft. The damage tolerance analysis of the proposed BWB wing/fuselage integration structure includes assessments of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability. The proposed structure includes a bird’s mouth termination of the spars that facilitates smooth transfer of loading from the spar web into the root rib and the upper and lower skins and is novel in its application to the blended wing body configuration. A finite element analysis was required to determine local stresses for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability and to identify weak spots in the proposed structure. The project aircraft wing comprises of three spars (front, centre and rear) and a <b>false</b> rear <b>spar</b> thus defining a four cell wing box. Wing root shear, bending moment and torque loads were derived and applied to a thin-walled three box idealisation of the proposed structure. The challenges experienced in replicating the loads obtained from the three box idealisation were addressed by modification of the boundary conditions. Checks for compression and shear buckling were also undertaken that confirmed that the applied loads were below the limits of the proposed structure. The finite element analysis showed very clearly that the stresses in the novel bird’s mouth spar termination were significantly lower than in the skin and that the skin remained the more critical damage tolerant component at the wing root when the structure was subjected to ultimate design stresses. The spar web at the bird’s mouth termination was shown to have a larger crack growth life compared to the skin. The thickness of the skin requires further investigation as a significant amount of local bending was experienced due to the applied pressure. The skin will sustain a two-bay crack at the design limit load thus proving the proposed wing fuselage integration structure to be damage tolerant. In conclusion, the main objective of the thesis has been achieved. An integrated wingfuselage joint with novel bird’s mouth spar termination and surrounding structure have been designed and substantiated (evaluated) by damage tolerance requirements.
