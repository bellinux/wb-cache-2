In this paper we show how to derive an agglomerate model for calculating oxygen reactions by describing dissolved oxygen in the agglomerates using two independent random processes. The first one is the probability that an oxygen molecule, which dissolves in the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> on the agglomerate surface, moves into and then remains in the agglomerates; the second one is the probability of the molecule being consumed in reactions. The first probability depends on CL structure and can be directly calculated; the second one is derived by assuming that the oxygen reduction is first-order kinetic. It is found that the distribution functions of the first process can be fitted to a generalised gamma distribution function, which enables us to derive an analytical agglomerate model. We also expend the model to include oxygen dissolution in the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film,</b> and apply it to simulate cathode electrodes. The results reveal that the resistance to oxygen diffusion in <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> and agglomerate in modern CL is minor, and that the main potential loss is due to oxygen dissolution in the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film...</b>|$|E

The polymer film is chosen to pre-concentrate analyte at the OTE surface to improve the sensitivity and provide selectivity against like charged interferences. OTEs such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) have been used extensively for spectroelectrochemical sensors, but {{little is known about}} the applicability of such sensors using other OTE materials, such as Boron Doped Diamond (BDD). One distinct advantage of BDD OTEs over ITO OTEs is their significant increase in sensitivity for organic compounds, such as 4 -aminophenol and hydroquinone.

40|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} to improve the {{electromechanical}} performance of ionic polymer–metal composites (IPMCs) by developing high surface area Pd-Pt electrodes and tailoring the ionomer membrane thickness. With proper electroless plating techniques, a high dispersion of palladium particles is achieved deep in the ionomer membrane, thereby increasing notably the interfacial surface area of electrodes. The membrane thickness is increased using 0. 5 and 1  mm thick <b>ionomer</b> <b>films.</b> For comparison, IPMCs with the same ionomer membranes, but conventional Pt electrodes, are also prepared and studied. The electromechanical, mechanoelectrical, electrochemical and mechanical properties of different IPMCs are characterized and discussed. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) is used to investigate the distribution of deposited electrode metals in the cross section of Pd-Pt IPMCs. Our experiments demonstrate that IPMCs assembled with millimeter thick ionomer membranes and newly developed Pd-Pt electrodes are superior in mechanoelectrical transduction, and show significantly higher blocking force compared to conventional type of IPMCs. The blocking forces of more than 0. 3  N were measured at 4 V DC input, exceeding the force output of typical Nafion® 117 -based Pt IPMCs more than two orders of magnitude.

An atomic force microscopy coupled with electrochemical technique (e-AFM) demonstrated that proton conduction reduced with film thickness, and abruptly decreased when film thickness was less than 10 nm for both carbon and platinum substrate.

40|$|Morphology of polymer {{electrolytes}} membranes (PEM), e. g., Nafion, inside PEM {{fuel cell}} catalyst layers {{has a significant}} impact on the electrochemical activity and transport phenomena that determine cell performance. In those regions, Nafion can be found as an ultrathin film, coating the catalyst and the catalyst support surfaces. The impact of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of these surfaces on the structural formation of the films has not been sufficiently explored yet. Here, we report an extensive molecular dynamics simulation investigation of the substrate effects on the ionomer ultrathin film morphology at different hydration levels. We use a mean-field-like model that we introduced in previous publications for the interaction of the hydrated Nafion ionomer with a substrate, characterized by a tunable degree of hydrophilicity. We show that the affinity of the substrate with water plays a crucial role in the molecular rearrangement of the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film,</b> resulting in completely different morphologies. Detailed structural description in different regions of the film shows evidence of strongly heterogeneous behavior. A qualitative discussion of the implications of our observations on the PEMFC catalyst layer performance is finally proposed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This work {{comprises}} {{an extensive}} coarse-grained molecular dynamics study of self-organization processes {{that define the}} mesoscopic structure of catalyst layers used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The detailed structural analysis focuses on agglomeration of Pt-decorated primary particles of graphitized carbon black, formation of ionomer domains, emergence of the porous network, and formation of interfaces between the distinct phases. Insights obtained enable us to decisively redraw the existing structural picture of the catalyst layer. As a key result, we found that ionomer forms a thin adhesive film, which partially covers agglomerates of Pt/carbon. Densely arranged charged side chains of ionomer form a highly ordered array on the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> surface. The preferential orientation of these charged side chains depends on the surface wetting properties of the agglomerates. As a major consequence, results on ionomer structure and distribution, presented in this work, seem to invalidate the classical electrolyte-flooded agglomerate model that has been widely applied to catalyst layers in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Instead, the structural analysis provided defines a need for novel models of proton transport, water distribution, and Pt effectiveness that account for the thin-film morphology of ionomer and the specific arrangement of surface groups. 9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Shape memory {{polyurethane}} (SMPU) ionomers containing constant 75 wt. % soft segment content were synthesized using poly(ε-caprolactone) diol, 4, 4 ′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1, 4 -butanediol and/or N,N-bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) -isonicotinamide. To introduce substrate bonding antibacterial activity, pyridinium {{was prepared}} through a neutralization reaction using 1 -iodooctane as neutralization agent. For the SMPU <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> obtained, tensile testing at 70 °C and {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} suggests that, at temperatures > Tms (the melting point of soft segments), 6. 72 and 29. 55 mol. % pyridinium within hard segments significantly decreased the mechanical properties such as the stress at 100 % elongation (70 °C), the initial modulus (70 °C) and the elastic modulus (75 - 110 °C). Cyclic tensile investigation demonstrated that the two factors, soft segment crystallization and hard segment physical crosslink, play {{a very important role}} in shape memory function in SMPU ionomers. For the each individual specimen, the fixity ratio increased, and the recovery ratio decreased with the extension of cooling time. After sufficient cooling time, the fixity ratio of all specimens can reach a high value (∼ 95 %). Owing to the disrupted physical crosslink in the sample containing 29. 55 mol. % pyridinium, the crystallization rate of soft segments has less effect on shape fixity. Therefore, a high fixity ratio (93. 8 %) can be achieved in a short cooling time (30 s). In the control sample, the fixity ratio is only 73. 7 % after 30 s cooling. In addition, the admirable substrate bonding antibacterial activity of prepared SMPU ionomers was verified using standards AACTT 147 and ASTM E 2149 in comparison with the control sample. The antibacterial activity of SMPU ionomers on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) is significant, and the rate of reduction of bacteria is 100 %; the antibacterial activity on Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae) increases from 83. 6 % to 90. 7 % with increase in pyridinium content from 6. 72 to 29. 55 mol. %.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} and lithium polymer batteries are important as future power sources in electronic devices, vehicles and stationary applications. The {{development of these}} power sources involves finding and characterising materials that are well suited r the application. The materials investigated in this thesis are the perfluorosulphonic ionomer NafionTM (DuPont) and metal oxides incorporated into the membrane form of this material. The ionomer is used as polymer electrolyte in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and the metal oxides are used as cathode materials in lithium polymer batters (LPB). Crystallinity in cast Nafion films can be introduced by ion beam exposure or aging. Spectroscopic investigations of the crystallinity of the ionomer indicate that the crystalline regions contain less water than amorphous regions and this could in part explain the drying out of the polymer electrolyte membrane in a PEMFC. Spectroscopic results on the equilibrated water uptake {{and the state of}} water in thin cast <b>ionomer</b> <b>films</b> indicate that there is a full proton transfer from the sulphonic acid group in the ionomer when there is one water molecule per sulphonate group. The LPB cathode materials, lithium manganese oxide and lithium cobalt oxide, were incorporated in situ in Nafion membranes. Other manganese oxides and cobalt oxides were incorporated in situ inside the membrane. Ion-exchange experiments from HcoO 2 to LiCoO 2 within the membrane were also successful.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of ionic aggregates in semi-crystalline Zn- and Na-neutralized poly(ethylene-ran-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) <b>ionomer</b> blown <b>films</b> {{has been}} explored with scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The ionic aggregates of Zn-EMAA are spherical, monodisperse and uniformly-distributed in as-extruded pellets and blown films prepared at low and high blow-up ratio. Thus, although the biaxial stresses of film blowing are sufficient to alter the PE superstructure, the ionic aggregates in Zn-EMAA are unaffected. In contrast, the morphology of Na-EMAA as detected by STEM changes from featureless in the as-extruded pellets to a heterogeneous distribution of Na-rich aggregates in the blown films. This transformation in Na-EMAA morphology is consistent with our earlier study of quiescent annealing suggesting that the morphological change is the result of thermal processing rather than the biaxial stresses of film blowing...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of fuel cell technology its advancement to being commercially functional is hindered {{by a number of}} crucial factors. These factors are often associated with the lack of appropriate materials or manufacturing routes that would enable the cost of electricity per kWh to compete with existing technology. Whilst most research efforts have been directed towards developing more active catalysts, the amount of catalyst required in the fuel cell can be further reduced by improving the platinum utilisation in the membrane electrode assembly. The platinum utilisation is a strong function of the catalyst layer preparation step and there remains significant scope for optimisation of this step. Whereas significant work has been conducted into the different components of the catalyst ink there is limited work and understanding on the influence of the mixing method of the catalyst ink. This study will focus on the influence of the mixing technique on the catalyst ink properties and on the final fuel cell performance. Specifically, the study will investigate the effect of the three different mixing techniques on (i) catalyst ink quality (ii) the physical properties of the resultant catalyst layer and (iii) the in-situ electrochemical performance of the membrane electrode assembly. A large set of characterisation techniques were chosen to effectively study the step wise processing of the catalyst layer, and fuel cell performance. The results presented here include a comparison of the various mixing techniques and a comprehensive 2 x 2 factorial design into the individual techniques. The results suggest that high energy mixing is required for effective distribution of catalyst layer components, an even catalyst layer topography and a highly functional ionomer network which consequently, enhances performance. The mixing energy referred to involves prolonged mixing time, enhanced mixing intensity or a combination of the two. During bead milling of catalyst inks, high intensity mixing seems to be beneficial however, prolonged mixing time appears to be detrimental to the <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> structure. During high shear stirring and ultrasonic homogenisation of catalyst inks, the ink mixture significantly heats up. It has been observed that at higher temperatures, Nafion elongates and the contact with catalyst agglomerates is enhanced. High shear stirring of catalyst inks seems to be most effective at high agitation rates. High mixing energies result in high shear forces and in addition, high mixing temperatures which appear to be beneficial to establishing an effective catalyst/Nafion interface, enhancing the three phase boundary observed during in-situ testing. Ultrasonic homogenisation seems to be more effective at prolonged sonication times. Due to the erosive nature of ultrasonic dispersion, sufficient time is required to establish a well dispersed and distributed catalyst ink. However, the nature of particle size distribution resulting from ultrasonication shows that inks are unstable and is not recommended for high throughput processing. Overall, fuel cell performance is not significantly affected by the mixing step however; mixing does have an observable impact on catalyst layer formulation. Generally, when optimizing membrane electrode assembly fabrication, mixing parameters should be carefully chosen. This goes without saying that parameters need to be effectively studied before foregoing catalyst ink processing...|$|E
40|$|Perfluoro ionomer {{membranes}} are tetrafluoro ethylene-based {{materials with}} microheterogeneous structures {{consisting of a}} hydrophobic polymer backbone and a hydrophilic side-chain cluster region. Due to the ionomer cluster morphology, these films exhibit unique transport properties. Recent investigations with perfluoro sulfonate and perfluoro sulfonate/carboxylate composite polymers have demonstrated their value in the dehydration of nitric acid and they show potential {{as an alternative to}} conventional, energy intensive unit operations in the concentration of acid feeds. As a result, investigations were conducted to determine the feasibility of using pure perfluoro carboxylate and mixed perfluoro sulfonate/carboxylate films for the dehydration of nitric acid because of the speculation of improved water selectivity of the carboxylate pendant chain. During the first phase of these investigations the effort was focused on generating a thin, solution cast perfluoro carboxylate <b>ionomer</b> <b>film,</b> to evaluate the general, chemical and physical characteristics of the polymer, and to assess the material's aqueous transport performance (flux and nitrate separation efficiencies) in pervaporation and high-pressure environments. Results demonstrated that generating robust solution-cast films was difficult yet a number of membranes survived high trans-membrane pressures up to 700 psig. General characterization of the solution cast product showed reduced ion exchange capacities when compared with thicker, ''as received'' perfluoro carboxylate and similar sulfonate films. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis results suggested that the solution cast carboxylate films contained a small fraction of sulfonate terminated side-chains. Aqueous transport experimentation showed that permeate fluxes for both pure water and nitric acid were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller for the carboxylate solution cast membranes when compared to their sulfonate counterparts of similar thickness (Nafion{trademark} 111). Additionally, nitric acid separation efficiencies ({alpha}) were approximately one order of magnitude higher for the carboxylate solution cast films when compared to Nafion{trademark} 111. The second phase of our work included the generation of thin carboxylate films made by the chemical synthesis perfluoro sulfonate and mixed sulfonate/carboxylate polymers from a perfluoro sulfonyl fluoride precursor, the characterization of the newly generated material, and a study of the transport characteristics of these membranes. Transport studies consisted of the dehydration of nitric acid feeds by pervaporation. In addition, the initial hypothesis was expanded to include demonstration that transmembrane flux and separation efficiencies are a function of the ratio between sulfonate and carboxylate terminated side chains of the perfluoro ionomer. Investigations demonstrated the ability to generate in- house films with varying sulfonate/carboxylate concentrations from commercially available perfluoro sulfonyl fluoride material, and showed that the converted films could be characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. Finally, the mixed films where subjected to nitric acid dehydration transport tests and a relationship was found to exist between sulfonate/carboxylate pendant chain ratio and both flux and water separation capability. In summary, experimental results confirmed that, when compared to Nafion 111 {trademark}, the mixed film's bulk fluxes decrease by approximately three orders of magnitude and the water separation factor increases by as much as two orders of magnitude as the carboxylate side-chain content was increased from 0 (pure sulfonate film) to 53 mole%, supporting the hypothesis given for this effort. It was observed that the water selectivity improved for both the solution cast perfluoro carboxylate and mixed perfluoro sulfonate/carboxylate films when judged against similar perfluoro sulfonate materials. Of great benefit was that during the investigation a number of research tools were utilized including, but in no way limited to, basic chemical operations, procedure development and refinement, the use of a number of analytical systems (FTIR, XRF, thermal gravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc.), data interpretation and analysis, and presentation and debate (defense) of results...|$|E
40|$|Electrification of {{vehicles}} could enable the transportation sector {{to be more}} efficient with reduced emissions. Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) vehicles powered by sustainably generated hydrogen fuel would be a viable replacement for internal combustion engines. PEFC powered vehicles are highly efficient and offer zero tailpipe emissions. State-of-the-art PEFCs rely on platinum (Pt) and platinum alloy catalyst nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon black bound by ionomer. The high Pt loadings currently needed for the low-temperature acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) incur significant costs due to the Pt raw material. Degradation of conventional carbon supported Pt electrodes remains a challenge for the commercialization of PEFCs. In the cathode, the ORR is sluggish and results in a large overpotential loss and hence reducing the Pt utilization. The strategy to make PEFC commercially viable is by reducing the cost through either {{reducing the amount of}} Pt in the electrode or replacing the Pt catalyst with alternative low-cost catalysts. Ionomer binder in conventional electrodes needed for proton conduction introduces undesirable high oxygen transport resistance that further reduces the Pt efficacy. However, novel ionomer-free electrodes, which have an advantage of no <b>ionomer</b> <b>film</b> resistance, relies on water for proton conduction and thus hindering the performance and stability at dry conditions. Alternative electrode designs can potentially alleviate some of the problems in these high power density devices. This work presents an alternative composite Nafion nanofiber catalyst support electrode, in which the oriented nanofibers provide robust internal proton transport to a conformal Pt catalyst coating without impeding oxygen transport. The high-surface-area electrodes are prepared by solution casting Nafion onto a sacrificial template, and thin Pt films are deposited on the nanofibers using either physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. The electrochemical characterization of the nanofiber electrodes demonstrates the high current density and specific activity of this nanofiber approach relative to prior electrodes fabricated by depositing Pt directly onto other Nafion surfaces. Even with the improved electrode architecture, the Pt raw material cost is still an obstacle. Hence, Pt group metal-free (PGM-free) PEFC cathodes are of significant interest for low-temperature ORR since they have the potential to reduce PEFC costs dramatically. The activity and durability of PGM-free catalyst have significantly improved in vii the last 10 years. However, several challenges remain before they can become commercially viable. The PGM-free catalysts have lower volumetric activity and hence the PGM-free cathodes are thicker than Pt-based electrodes. Thus, they suffer from significantly greater gas and proton transport resistances that reduce the observed performance and robustness of operation. To better understand the efficacy of the catalyst and improve electrode performance, a detailed understanding of the correlation between electrode fabrication, morphology, and performance is crucial. This dissertation reports the characterization of PEFC cathodes featuring a PGM-free catalyst using nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) and morphological analysis. In this work, the pore/solid structure and the Nafion distribution was resolved in three dimensions (3 D) using nano-CT for three PGM-free electrodes of varying Nafion loading. The particular PGM-free cathode being studied feature two distinct length scales of interest and was resolved using multi-resolution imaging in nano-CT. The associated transport properties were evaluated from pore/particle-scale simulations within the nano-CT imaged structure. These characterizations are then used to elucidate the microstructural origins of the dramatic changes in fuel cell performance with varying Nafion loading. The results show that this is primarily a result of distinct changes in Nafions spatial distribution. The significant impact of electrode morphology on performance highlights the importance of PGM-free electrode development in concert with efforts to improve catalyst activity and durability. To understand the potential distribution in the thick electrodes we utilize a novel experimental technique to measure the electrolyte potential directly at discrete points across the thickness of the catalyst layer and evaluate the ORR along the thickness of the catalyst layer. Using that technique, the electrolyte potential drop, the through-thickness reaction distribution, and the proton conductivity is measured and correlated with the corresponding Nafion morphology and cell performance. At this stage of PGM-free catalyst development, it is also necessary to optimize these thick electrodes along with the catalyst. To address the significant transport losses in thick PGM-free cathodes (ca. 3 ̆e 60 m), we developed a two-dimensional (2 D) hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique structure of the PGM-free electrode. The 2 D computational model is employed to correlate the morphology and the electrochemical performance of the PGM-free electrodes. The model is a complete cell, continuum model that includes an agglomerate model representation of the cathode. A unique feature of the approach is the integration of the model with morphology and transport parameter statistics extracted from nano-CT imaging of the electrodes. The model was validated with experimental results of the PGM-free electrode with three levels of Nafion loading. We discuss the sensitivity of the PGM-free catalyst layer on the operating conditions and the morphological parameters to identify improved architectures for PGM-free cathodes. We employ the model to evaluate the targets for the volumetric activity of the catalyst. A notable finding is the impact of the liquid water accumulation in the electrode and the significant performance improvement possible if electrode flooding is mitigated...|$|E

The operating conditions of interest ranged from 60 °C to 120 °C in cell temperature and 0 % to 100 % in relative humidity. ^ Factors limiting the oxygen transport in the cathode gas diffusion layer were found through characterizing critical properties of the GDL. Linear empirical relationships for permeability coefficient versus limiting current were found at multiple operating conditions. Porosimetry measurement provided the pore size distribution for the gas diffusion layer, which helped in understanding the correlation between the permeability coefficient and the limiting current. ^ Convection was found significant in oxygen transport through the GDL even when using a conventional flow field pattern (i. e. not interdigitated). The influence of cell temperature, oxygen mole fraction, and relative humidity on the limiting current due to reactant gas transport under conditions where there is no significant flooding was evaluated. Cell relative humidity significantly affected the limiting current by reducing oxygen transport through the <b>ionomer</b> thin <b>film</b> of the cathode catalyst layer as the relative humidity decreased. A GDL with higher gas permeability in the micro-porous layer had a higher limiting current due to increased convection. ^ A novel GDL was shown superior to several commercial gas diffusion layers in elevated temperature and/or low relative humidity PEMFC operation. The in-house GDL enabled high performance at elevated temperature conditions. The in-house GDL also enabled PEMFCs to be operated at no external humidification with a minimal additional loss compared to near-saturated conditions at a cell temperature up to 80 °C. ^ An analysis technique to evaluate six sources of polarization, including two concentration polarization losses, in hydrogen/air proton exchange membrane fuel cell was developed.
