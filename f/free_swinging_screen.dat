40|$|When a new {{prosthetic}} {{component is}} {{introduced to the}} market, it often needs further improvements or accessory devices that only become apparent when clients and clinicians {{have had a chance}} to put the device to all of its possible uses. Since the LTICollier Locking Shoulder Joint was introduced, a number of improvements have been made both in the product and its accessories in response to user feedback. In the original concept, the user was assumed to need to unlock only momentarily between activities. For most users this assumption is wrong. The most popular feature of the joint turns out to be its ability to remain in <b>free</b> <b>swing.</b> Improvements in the joint itself have either added strength where required or have increased the number of users who can readily put the joint into <b>free</b> <b>swing.</b> To make <b>free</b> <b>swing</b> accessible to more amputees, an electric elbow lock was developed.

40|$|Abstract: To {{search for}} eras in a sports league, we utilize time series tests with {{structural}} breaks to identify eras in Major League Baseball performance. Using data from 1871 - 2010, {{the mean and}} standard deviation of four different performance measures are examined to test if deterministic or stochastic trends and structural breaks are present. Throughout, we identify breaks endogenously from the data. Perhaps most notable among our findings, we identify a deterministic trend in the mean slugging percentage in 1921 and 1992, which coincides with {{the early years of the}} <b>free</b> <b>swinging</b> (Babe Ruth) era and the modern steroid era, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Comparing talent {{across time}} is {{difficult}} as productivity changes. To compare talent across time we utilize Major League baseball data from 1871 - 2010 and time series techniques {{to determine if}} the mean and standard deviation of five performance measures are stationary and if structural breaks exist. We identify two structural breaks in the mean slugging percentage: in 1921, the <b>free</b> <b>swinging</b> era of Babe Ruth, and in 1992, the steroid era. Given that productivity changes over time, we develop a simple benchmark technique to compare talent over time and identify superstars. Applications of this measure outside of baseball are also suggested...|$|R

We present a simple and rigorous approach {{to the problem of}} finding the smallest set of active joints for which the manipulator remains equilibrated with respect to <b>free</b> <b>swinging</b> joint failure in any joint.

A fine, stalwart race, with the <b>free</b> <b>swinging</b> walk of mountaineers, bright-eyed, clear-skinned, with cheeks as brown as berries. His dormant patriotism, already awakened by his long ride through the beautiful, dimly-familiar country, beat in his heart.

40|$|The free plane {{motion of}} a {{compound}} pendulum is studied using the Lagrange equations of motion. The specific compound pendulum {{consists of a}} main plane disk from which are suspended two chains, {{each of which is}} composed of m and n rigid plane disks, respectively. A nonlinear system of m + n + 1 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to the properly selected generalized coordinates, is obtained. For small-amplitude swing the above system becomes a linear differential system. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors constitute the eigenfrequencies and the modeshapes, respectively, of the <b>free</b> <b>swing</b> of the considered compound pendulum. Also, relations are extracted which ensure a unique swing with no relative rotation between any two disks. Finally, several numerical results are given. © 1991...|$|R
50|$|The front rigging is {{attached}} to the saddle in one of three ways: ring, flat plate or in-skirt. Ring rigging is made of rings on heavy leather straps attached directly to the saddle tree. This is the strongest attachment method, but a disadvantage is that it creates bulk under the legs and inhibits the <b>free</b> <b>swing</b> of the stirrups. The second style of attachment is the flat plate. This type has leather layers that are riveted around a metal plate and attached directly to the tree of the saddle. This is also a very strong type of ring attachment that reduces bulk under the leg and does not inhibit the swinging of the stirrups, though it is not as strong as ring rigging.|$|R
