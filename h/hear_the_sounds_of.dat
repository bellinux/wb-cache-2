5|$|RAF Handforth was a {{large and}} {{important}} storage facility that contributed directly to the war effort. The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> air-raids on Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> battle only six miles downwind.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

500|$|Cut-off, about midnight the North Korean 239th Regiment {{attempted}} {{to break out}} to the north, launching a number of attacks against the Americans. During the first attack {{a small group of}} North Koreans succeeded in infiltrating the K Company command post at Yongju. In the close-quarter fighting that ensured Captain Claude K. Josey, the American company commander, tackled a North Korean machine-gunner, and despite being wounded twice he succeeded in disarming him before collapsing from his injuries. Josey was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. As the fighting continued the K Company executive officer was also wounded, yet the Americans eventually drove off the North Koreans, many of whom were subsequently killed. Nearby, the British and Australians could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> heavy fighting between the Americans and North Koreans [...] to the north. Half an hour later a small group of North Koreans attacked A Company, 1 ASHR with grenades, killing two men and wounding two more before being repulsed having suffered one killed and one wounded. A large concentration of around 300 North Koreans were subsequently observed assembling in Yongju by the K Company forward observer, however the American artillery had relocated during the fighting and was unable to engage the target. Two guns from C Battery, US 674th Artillery Battalion were ordered to reposition south Sukchon to support US 3/187 RCT. Following two more North Korean attacks the Americans near Hill 163 were forced to abandon the roadblock after running out of ammunition. Detecting the withdrawal, the North Koreans attacked again at 04:00. Meanwhile, after forcing their way through heavy North Korean machine-gun and rifle fire the two American howitzers were successfully redeployed, coming into action at 04:15. To the south, the British and Australians could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> renewed fighting, and they began to fear that the Americans had been overrun.|$|E

500|$|After undressing, {{the newly}} arrived Jews were beaten with whips {{to drive them}} towards the gas chambers; {{hesitant}} men were treated particularly brutally. Rudolf Höss, the commandant at Auschwitz, contrasted the practice at Treblinka of deceiving the victims about the showers with his own camp's practice of telling them {{they had to go}} through a [...] "delousing" [...] process. According to the postwar testimony of some SS officers, men were always gassed first, while women and children waited outside the gas chambers for their turn. During this time, the women and children could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> suffering from inside the chambers, and they became aware of what awaited them, which caused panic, distress, and even involuntary defecation. According to Stangl, a train transport of about 3,000 people could be [...] "processed" [...] in three hours. In a 14-hour workday, 12,000 to 15,000 people were killed. After the new gas chambers were built, the duration of the killing process was reduced to an hour and a half.|$|E

This was stopped when the narrator's ancestor killed his entire family in their sleep and left the country in order to end the horror, leaving the remaining human livestock (as well as a single De la Poer whom the narrator finds in a cell) to be devoured by the rats that inhabited the underground city's cesspits.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} slowing and/or {{reversing}} of calcification, organisms may suffer other adverse effects, either indirectly through negative impacts on food resources, or directly as reproductive or physiological effects. For example, the elevated oceanic levels of [...] may produce -induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia. Also, increasing ocean acidity {{is believed to}} have a range of direct consequences. For example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid; depress the immune responses of blue mussels; and make it harder for juvenile clownfish to tell apart the smells of non-predators and predators, or <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> their predators. This is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise. This impacts all animals that use sound for echolocation or communication. Atlantic longfin squid eggs took longer to hatch in acidified water, and the squid's statolith was smaller and malformed in animals placed in sea water with a lower pH. The lower PH was simulated with 20-30 times the normal amount of [...] However, as with calcification, as yet there is not a full understanding of these processes in marine organisms or ecosystems.|$|E
