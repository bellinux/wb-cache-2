Freyr, impatient, comments that one night is long, as is two nights, and questions <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> bear three, noting that frequently a month seemed shorter than half a night before being with Gerðr.|$|E
5|$|Norman holds Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tram car full of {{children}} hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. He forces Peter to choose whom {{he wants to}} save and drops Mary Jane and the children. Peter manages to save both Mary Jane and the tram car, while Norman is pelted by civilians who side with Spider-Man. Norman then grabs Peter and throws him into an abandoned building where they battle. When Norman boasts about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> later kill Mary Jane, an enraged Peter overpowers Norman.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} Dr. Noah's lair at the {{pinnacle}} of Mount Everest. Noah (Sisko) enters and gives a monologue about <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> destroy the world, and shows a big red button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final check of the laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows the program will end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 72 is a {{continuation}} from Sonnet 71. Both sonnets are an anticipatory plea regarding death and the afterlife from the writer to the reader. The overarching subject of Sonnet 72 is The Poet's fixation with <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be remembered after death. Subsequently the tone remains bleak and self-depreciating.|$|E

He again eviscerates the Pandavas for all their chicanery during the war and decries their legacy. Venerating his own character, Duryodhana proclaims he will die happily. Duryodhana then turns to Krishna and {{specifically}} accuses him of engineering his defeat, calling Krishna the most sinful of the lot.|$|E
25|$|Relieved Davis and {{appointed}} D. D. Porter to the Western Flotilla, which is hereafter {{to be recognized}} as a squadron. Porter is but a Commander. He has, however, stirring and positive qualities, is fertile in resources, has great energy, excessive and sometimes not over-scrupulous ambition, is impressed with and boastful of his own powers, given to exaggeration in relation to himself, a Porter infirmity, is not generous to older and superior living officers, whom he is too ready to traduce, but is kind and patronizing to favorites who are juniors, and generally to official inferiors.

25|$|On 6 May 1997, {{following}} the 1997 general election which brought a Labour government to {{power for the}} first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|The Master's {{past with}} the Doctor is {{explored}} somewhat in The Dark Path, which reveals {{that his name}} prior to taking the alias of the Master is Koschei, when he encounters the Second Doctor during their travels. Although initially a somewhat anti-heroic version of the Doctor, willing to commit murder as a first option to save the day but generally still {{trying to do the}} right, Koschei turns to evil and becomes the Master after he discovers that his companion and lover, Ailla, is an undercover agent of the Celestial Intervention Agency sent to spy on him. During the course of the novel, Ailla is shot and killed, with Koschei, not knowing that she is a Time Lord and will simply regenerate, completing a time-based weapon to benefit the anti-alien efforts of soldiers from Earth's Empire, in an attempt to bring her back. The weapon is used to destroy the planet Teriliptus and its inhabitants, but when Ailla turns up alive, the knowledge that he has destroyed a planet for nothing, coupled with the revelation of Ailla's betrayal, proves too much. Koschei resolves to bring his own order to the universe at the expense of free will and becoming its Master. Thanks to the Doctor reprogramming his weapon, Koschei is trapped in a black hole {{at the end of the}} novel, with it being left uncertain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> escape. Although it is generally implied that it takes him most of his remaining lives to do so (hence why the Master is on his last life while the Doctor, intended to be his contemporary, is only on his third), the cover art of The Dark Path depicts Koschei as being already the same regeneration as the Delgado-era Master.|$|E

[...] Jack explains his plans to her on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> get Tracy to return, with Liz once again mocking Jack, this time in a deep raspy voice, [...] "Just get it done. Nope.

While trying to reach them, he causes a set of metal gates to bend towards him {{as the result of}} his mutant ability to create magnetic fields and control metal manifesting, only to be knocked out by the guards. In the not too distant future, U.S. Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a [...] "Mutant Registration Act" [...] in Congress, which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Present are Lehnsherr, now going by the name [...] "Magneto", and his telepathic colleague Professor Charles Xavier.

The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is [...] "not a match". Heiter secures a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura). The doctor explains {{that he is a}} world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system.|$|E
500|$|The {{portrayal}} of Jesus' death in John is unique {{among the four}} Gospels. [...] It {{does not appear to}} rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice (cf. Mk 10:45, Rom 3:25) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father. [...] Likewise, the three [...] "passion predictions" [...] of the Synoptic Gospels (Mk 8:31, 9:31, 10:33–34 and pars.) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be exalted or [...] "lifted up"(Jn 3:14, 8:28, 12:32). [...] The verb for [...] "lifted up" [...] reflects the double entendre at work in John's theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.|$|E

500|$|The {{ringleader}} of {{the elaborate}} bank heist. Russell first {{appears at the}} beginning of the film, breaking the fourth wall and narrating in medias res of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> commit the perfect bank robbery. Owen nearly turned down the role; like Washington, he expressed concerns over the character’s disguise of a hood, mask and sunglasses: [...] "To play whole scenes where you’re masked, you've got on sunglasses and you’re wearing a hood is very weird, because a lot of acting is often through intent, and intent is shown through the eyes. To suddenly have that taken away and have this big barrier there was very disarming." [...] Owen, however, accepted the role after further discussing the part with Lee. The script was also revised to include scenes in which Owen's face could be shown.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{is known}} for his skill at filming with {{multiple}} camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, [...] "Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera." [...] One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, [...] "Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> cut it." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian and {{political}} scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon, [...] "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?" [...] Nixon's biographers disagree on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be perceived by history. According to Ambrose, [...] "Nixon {{wanted to be}} judged by what he accomplished. What he {{will be remembered for}} is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation." [...] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that [...] "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy". Aitken feels that [...] "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics try to {{illustrate}} Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the [...] "superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy" [...] {{of the previous}} incarnations. Cornell {{tried to focus on}} the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents - [...] "There's an isolation in that; the stakes are very high. I've done a lot of living in my 42 years, and it wasn't hard for me to relate to that." [...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Six {{placed a}} Japanese male {{at the front}} of the {{centipede}} for two reasons: first to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film. Six stated in the director's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his [...] "own nightmare." ...|$|E
500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be able to get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do anything if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E
