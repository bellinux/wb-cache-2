50|$|Plants produce starch {{by first}} {{converting}} glucose 1-phosphate to ADP-glucose using the enzyme glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. This step requires {{energy in the}} form of ATP. The enzyme starch synthase then adds the ADP-glucose via a 1,4-alpha glycosidic bond to a growing chain of glucose residues, liberating ADP and creating amylose. Starch branching enzyme introduces 1,6-alpha glycosidic bonds between these chains, creating the branched amylopectin. The starch debranching enzyme <b>isoamylase</b> removes some of these branches. Several isoforms of these enzymes exist, leading to a highly complex synthesis process.|$|E
50|$|After the phosphorylation, {{the first}} {{degrading}} enzyme, beta-amylase (BAM) can attack the glucose chain at its non-reducing end. Maltose is released {{as the main}} product of starch degradation. If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules, BAM cannot release maltose. A second enzyme, disproportionating enzyme-1 (DPE1), combines two maltotriose molecules. From this chain, a glucose molecule is released. Now, BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain. This cycle repeats until starch is degraded completely. If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain, {{it can no longer}} release maltose. In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded, the enzyme <b>isoamylase</b> (ISA) is required.|$|E

However, the decrease in <b>isoamylase</b> activity was not related to the magnitude of the sugary phenotype (the proportion of the phytoglycogen region of the endosperm), as observed with pullulanase. In the moderately mutated line EM- 5, the pullulanase activity was markedly lower in the phytoglycogen region than in the starch region, and <b>isoamylase</b> activity was extremely low or completely lost in the whole endosperm tissue.

40|$|Starch {{debranching}} enzymes, which specifically hydrolyse a- 1, 6 -glucosidic {{bonds in}} glucans containing both a- 1, 4 and a- 1, 6 linkages, are classified into two types: <b>isoamylase</b> (EC. 3. 2. 1. 68) and limit dextrinase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 41). The starch debranching enzymes are primarily involved in starch degradation during seed germination. Recently, however, starch debranching enzymes, particularly <b>isoamylase,</b> have {{been implicated in}} starch biosynthesis in many plant species. In this study, a 2, 590 -bp <b>isoamylase</b> cDNA, which encoded an 88 -kDa <b>isoamylase</b> pre-protein containing the N-terminal transit peptide of 5 kDa, was isolated from a developing wheat kernel cDNA library. The recombinant protein produced in E. coli by expression of the cDNA exhibited isoamylase-type debranching enzyme activity. Accumulation of the 2. 6 -kb <b>isoamylase</b> transcripts in various tissues of wheat indicated the involvement of <b>isoamylase</b> in both starch synthesis in storage and non-storage organs, and starch degradation during seed germination. In the early stages during wheat kernel development, {{the presence of a}} 1. 7 -kb transcript was observed. The 1. 7 -kb transcript encoded a 51 -kDa truncated <b>isoamylase,</b> whose starch debranching enzyme activity could not be detected in vitro. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar CDC Teal) showed that <b>isoamylase</b> gene existed as a single copy in the wheat genome. Therefore, the production of various <b>isoamylase</b> transcripts and the involvement of <b>isoamylase</b> during two developmental stages of wheat plant may result from transcriptional modification of the existing gene and/or expression from a distantly related gene. Western blot analysis using rabbit antibodies raised against wheat <b>isoamylase</b> detected a single polypeptide of 83 -kDa from developing wheat kernels. Accumulation of <b>isoamylase</b> polypeptide increased as the kernels developed from five to 15 days post-anthesis (dpa), and then started to decrease in 20 -dpa kernels until it could not be detected in mature kernels. Similar to the presence of <b>isoamylase,</b> highest activity of limit dextrinase was observed in 15 -dpa wheat kernels. According to the amounts of polysaccharides present at different stages during wheat kernel development, the concentration of starch increased as kernels matured, while the amylose/amylopectin ratio remained constant until the kernels reached a fully matured stage. The relationships between the concentrations of polysaccharides and the presence of <b>isoamylase</b> polypeptide, and the activity of limit dextrinase in developing wheat grains have suggested that debranching activities of starch debranching enzymes are essential to maintain a constant ratio of amylose and amylopectin during wheat kernel development...|$|E

As the interesting property of isolated strain, <b>isoamylase</b> activity in the culture filtrate was about 500 units per ml of broth after 100 hours of cultivation using CH_ 3 COONH_ 4 as a nitrogen source. While, by using （NH_ 4 ）_ 2 SO_ 4 instead of CH_ 3 COONH_ 4, <b>isoamylase</b> formation and cell growth proceeded simultaneously, but almost all <b>isoamylase</b> activity formed was a cell-bound type after 16 - 18 hours of cultivation. Its activity was shown to be 120 units per ml of the culture broth （ 27 units per mg of cell weight）. So, the isolated strain was considered to hold two different <b>isoamylase</b> formation mechanisms representing either way according {{to the type of}} the nitrogen sources used. In aerated batch cultivation using 1000 ml jar fermentor, some experiments were performed in order to compare various carbon sources in regard to the quantitative relationship between cell growth and <b>isoamylase</b> formation under the limited condition of cell-bound <b>isoamylase</b> formation. As the results of batch culture, isolated strain showed the suitable property for aerated culture, and cell-bound <b>isoamylase</b> formed quantitatively 25 units per mg of yield cell. However, when cultivation was carried out under the condition of oxygen limiting for cell growth, yield cell per unit consumed carbon source and <b>isoamylase</b> activity per mg of yield cell showed lower numerical values in comparison with another cases. In feeding cultivation based on aerated batch cultivation, the cultivation with a constant level （ 1. 0 ppm） of dissolved oxygen concentration in the broth was carried out to obtain the higher cell conentration in broth. As the results, feeding cultivation in this work was able to produce 12 - 13 mg per ml of the broth, and <b>isoamylase</b> activity per mg of cell and ml of cultured broth wers 35 units and 420 units respectively. Thus, the feeding culture achieved about 2. 5 times of the final yield of <b>isoamylase</b> in the conventional batchwise culture. In order to obtain higher <b>isoamylase</b> activity per unit cell weight, a cell concentration of more than 10 （g/l） in the fermentated broth was needed.

Continuous cultivation with control of dissolved oxygen concentration in the broth was used for cell-bound <b>isoamylase</b> formation of isolated strain by regulating the rate of aeration and feed. The cell growth and cell-bound <b>isoamylase</b> formation were stable during continuous cultivation and the carbon source in the feed medium was completely consumed by cells.

40|$|Using homogenates of autopsy tissue, we {{compared}} three widely available techniques for separating amylase isoen-zymes: wheat-germ inhibition (WI), and electrophoresis on cellulose acetate (CA) or agarose (AG). WI separated amy-lase into two isoforms, CA into seven (three pancreatic and four salivary), and AG into nine (five pancreatic and four salivary). CA and WI had similar <b>isoamylase</b> detection limits (8 - 10 U/L) and similar imprecision in measuring percent S-type vs P-type <b>isoamylase</b> (within-run SD 1 - 2 %), and they demonstrated a linear response to added S or P <b>isoamylase.</b> In contrast, the AG method had higher detection limits (10 - 15 U/L), greater imprecision (within-run SD 3 %), and showed a nonlinear response to added S or P <b>isoamylase.</b> We conclude that CA and WI have essentially equivalent assay attnbutes, superior to AG, but that CA resolves more amy-lase isoforms than WI. Amylase (1, 4 -a-n-glucan- 4 -glucanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 1) {{was the first}} enzyme activity described when Kirchhoff, in 1811, discovered the digestion of starch by wheat extracts (1). Assays for a-amylase enzyme activity have now been performed in clinical laboratories for more than 50 years. Methods for the separation of amylase isoforms, such as electrophoresis, {{were used in the}} early 1970 s to increase the clinical diagnostic specificity of serum amylase measure-ments (2 - 4). Few studies have compared these methods for isoform separation, and none has done so for tissue homoge-nates (1, 5 - 7). Here we compare three methods for separa-tion of amylase isoenzymes and isoforms in selected homog-enates of human autopsy tissue: wheat-germ inhibition (WI), electrophoresis on cellulose acetate (CA), and electro-phoresis on agarose (AG). 2 We show that the use of these different techniques results in different estimates of the <b>isoamylase</b> composition of these tissues.

40|$|SUMMARY Serum {{pancreatic}} <b>isoamylase</b> {{activities were}} used to assess exocrine pancreatic function in 39 patients with diabetes mellitus (21 on insulin, 12 on sulphonylureas, and six on biguanides or diet), and the results were compared with serum immunoreactive trypsin concentrations. Thirteen patients had decreased pancreatic <b>isoamylase</b> activity, the insulin-dependent diabetics showing the highest incidence of abnormality. This incidence of abnormality is similar to that previously described for serum immunoreactive trypsin, and the two procedures gave excellent overall correlation (r = 0 9). Our observations offer further evidence that pancreatic exocrine function is impaired in diabetes mellitus. Serum <b>isoamylase</b> determination provides a convenient, inexpensive, and rapid procedure for its detection. Patients with diabetes mellitus have been shown by duodenal enzyme studies'- 5 and by serum immuno-reactive trypsin (IRT) measurement 6 to have impaired pancreatic exocrine function, the incidence being highest in insulin-dependent patients. Serum amylase activity normally derives from both the pancreas and the salivary glands, but the pancreatic isoenzyme is reduced when pancreatic exocrine function is deficient, 7 - 9 and pancreatic <b>isoamylase</b> determina-tion provides a convenient non-invasive test for such deficiency. We have, therefore, measured serum pancreatic <b>isoamylase</b> activity in diabetics and have compared the results with serum IRT levels. Material and methods Sera from 39 patients aged 24 to 77 years (19 men, 20 women) with diabetes mellitus were studied. They were classified on the basis of treatment: 21 on insulin, 12 on sulphonylureas, and six on diet or biguanide therapy. Occasional patients on sul-phonylureas had also received biguanides but no subjects classified as on biguanides had received sulphonylureas. Reference values were obtained from 100 apparently healthy blood donors (50 men and 50 women). Samples were separated on Beckman cellulose acetate membrane using the Beckman Microzon...|$|E
40|$|DNA insertional transformants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were {{screened}} chemochromically for attenuated H 2 production. One mutant, displaying low H 2 gas photoproduction, has a nonfunctional {{copy of a}} gene that shows high homology {{to the family of}} <b>isoamylase</b> genes found in several photosynthetic organisms. DNA gel blotting and gene complementation were used to link this <b>isoamylase</b> gene to previously characterized nontagged sta 7 mutants. This mutant is therefore denoted sta 7 - 10. In C. reinhardtii, the STA 7 <b>isoamylase</b> gene is important for the accumulation of crystalline starch, and the sta 7 - 10 mutant reported here contains 7 h under anaerobic incubation. Complementation of mutant cells with genomic DNA corresponding to the STA 7 gene restores both the starch accumulation and H 2 production phenotypes. The results indicate that STA 7 and starch metabolism {{play an important role in}} C. reinhardtii H 2 photoproduction. Moreover, the results indicate that mere anaerobiosis is not sufficient to maintain hydrogenase gene expression without the underlying physiology, an important aspect of which is starch metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Isoamylase-type {{debranching}} enzymes (ISAs) play {{an important}} role in determining starch structure. Amylopectin – a branched polymer of glucose – is the major component of starch granules and its architecture underlies the semi-crystalline nature of starch. Mutants of several species lacking the ISA 1 -subclass of <b>isoamylase</b> are impaired in amylopectin synthesis. Consequently, starch levels are decreased and an aberrant soluble glucan (phytoglycogen) with altered branch lengths and branching pattern accumulates. Here we use TAP (tandem affinity purification) tagging to provide direct evidence in Arabidopsis that ISA 1 interacts with its homolog ISA 2. No evidence for interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes was found. Analysis of the single mutants shows that each protein is destabilised in the absence of the other. Co-expression of both ISA 1 and ISA 2 Escherichia coli allowed the formation of the active recombinant enzyme and we show using site-directed mutagenesis that ISA 1 is the catalytic subunit. The presence of the active <b>isoamylase</b> alters glycogen biosynthesis in E. coli, resulting in colonies that stain more starch-like with iodine. However, analysis of the glucans reveals that rather than producing an amylopectin like substance, cells expressing the active <b>isoamylase</b> still accumulate small amounts of glycogen together with a population of linear oligosaccharides that stain strongly with iodine. We conclude that for <b>isoamylase</b> to promote amylopectin synthesis it needs to act on a specific precursor (pre-amylopectin) generated by the combined actions of plant starch synthase and branching enzyme isoforms and when presented with an unsuitabl...|$|E
40|$|Although often {{clinically}} silent, pancreatic cellular injury (PCI) {{is relatively}} frequent after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass; and its etiology and time course are largely unknown. We defined PCI as the simultaneous presence of abnormal values of pancreatic <b>isoamylase</b> and immunoreactive trypsin (IRT). The frequency and time evolution of PCI were assessed {{in this condition}} using assays for specific exocrine pancreatic enzymes. Correlations with inflammatory markers were searched for preoperative risk factors. One hundred ninety-three patients submitted to cardiac surgery were enrolled prospectively. Blood IRT, amylase, pancreatic <b>isoamylase,</b> lipase, and markers of inflammation (alpha 1 -protease inhibitor, alpha 2 -macroglobulin, myeloperoxidase) were measured preoperatively and postoperatively until day 8. The postoperative increase in plasma levels of pancreatic enzymes and urinary IRT was biphasic in all patients: early after surgery and later (from day 4 to 8 after surgery). One hundred thirty-three patients (69 %) experienced PCI, with mean IRT, <b>isoamylase,</b> and alpha 1 -protease inhibitor values higher for each sample than that in patients without PCI. By multiple regression analysis, we found preoperative values of plasma IRT >or= 40 ng/mL, amylase >or= 42 IU/mL, and pancreatic <b>isoamylase</b> >or= 20 IU/L associated with {{a higher incidence of}} postsurgery PCI (P < 0. 005). In the PCI patients, a significant correlation was found between the 4 pancreatic enzymes and urinary IRT, total calcium, myeloperoxidase, alpha 1 -protease inhibitor, and alpha 2 -macroglobulin. These data support a high prevalence of postoperative PCI after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, typically biphasic and clinically silent, especially when pancreatic enzymes were elevated preoperatively.

40|$|In this study, {{our goal}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of starch debranching enzymes in the determination of the structure of amylopectin. We screened mutant populations of Arabidopsis for plants with alterations in the structure of leaf starch by using iodine staining. The leaves of two mutant lines stained reddish brown, whereas wild-type leaves stained brownish black, indicating that a more highly branched polyglucan than amylopectin was present. The mutants were allelic, and the mutation mapped to position 18. 8 on chromosome 1. One mutant line lacked the transcript for a gene with sequence similarity to higher plant debranching enzymes, and both mutants lacked a chloroplastic starch-hydrolyzing enzyme. This enzyme was identified as a debranching enzyme of the <b>isoamylase</b> type. The loss of this <b>isoamylase</b> resulted in a 90 % reduction in the accumulation of starch in this mutant line when compared with the wild type and in the accumulation of the highly branched water-soluble polysaccharide phytoglycogen. Both normal starch and phytoglycogen accumulated simultaneously in the same chloroplasts in the mutant lines, suggesting that <b>isoamylase</b> has an indirect rather than a direct role in determining amylopectin structure...|$|E

The two methods showed good correla-tion. The precision varied from 1. 0 to 2. 5 % (CV) within-day and from 1. 1 to 5. 6 % (CV) day-to-day. The sub-strate, /?-nitrophenyl-a-D-maltoheptaoside, was also applied to an automated <b>isoamylase</b> assay. The amyläse inhibitor from wheat {{was used to determine}} the ratio of pancreatic and salivary amyläse activities of serum. About 80 % of salivary type amyläse was inhibited up to an activity level of 1000 U/l, while Inhibition of pancreatic type amyläse activity was only 10 — 15 %. Ratios of pancreatic to salivary amyläse from 0. 1 to 10 can be evaluated in serum with wheat inhibitor.
