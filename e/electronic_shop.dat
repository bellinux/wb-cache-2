His work at the <b>electronic</b> <b>shop</b> fed Burton’s fascination with electronics and sound, but he was obstructed by the limited opportunities for African-Americans to work in the field, especially in the Deep South.

40|$|Internet {{shopping}} {{is generally considered}} {{to grow in the}} future, however, the forecasts about the growth rate vary a lot (US Department of Commerce, 1998; OECD, 1998). So far the main focus in <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> has been on the marketing, ordering, and paying processes. Logistical processes have most often been based on the existing distribution structures causing additional costs to the consumers. In this paper we argue that the major restricting factor for the growth of <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> is physical distribution and supply chain management. Internet shopping facilitates significant redesigning of the entire supply chain from the factories to the households. It also enables expanding ECR (Efficient Consumer Response) systems to the households by changing the logistics control principles.

They often cheated gullible travellers and got involved in street brawls. Saabir, Dawood and their friends called their group, [...] "Young Company". They would hang out near Crawford Market in search of gullible travellers and offer them smuggled Rolex watches for a measely price compared to the actual cost. After the buyer paid them in cash, they would pretend to wrap the watch in a small paper or cloth and tell the buyer not to open it to avoid police suspicion. Actually it would be a stone instead of the watch. They called this activity [...] "alta-palti". If the buyer found out that he had been cheated and accosted them, they would intimidate him with the help of burly Pathan hoodlums from the neighbourhood.Their father requested Haji Mastan to give his wastrel sons decent employment.

This {{project is to}} develop <b>Electronic</b> <b>Shopping</b> Cart Code Detection Tool that will detect {{shopping}} cart code. This tool only can detect PHP files in e-commerce systems. It is because this project focused the research on the e-commerce PHP website. E-commerce PHP website has been chosen for this project is because PHP is a programming language develop for open source and the more important factor here is recently, many system developers applied PHP to develop their systems including e-commerce systems. Logic Scoring Preferences Model is a model {{that will be used}} as a guideline of quality level to be identified and used in the development of this tool. And also that's how the result of code detection will be displayed; according to quality level specified by Logic Scoring Preferences Model (0 = unsatisfactory, 1 = marginal, 2 - satisfactory). To achieve one of these project objectives that are to identify the shopping cart characteristics, data collection has been made such as e-commerce websites observation and comparison. This type of data collection has been used to identify the characteristics normally used in e-commerce website arid to identify the differences of characteristics applied by e-commerce websites. Some interviews with e-commerce expertise also have been conducted in order to gain more information for this project.
