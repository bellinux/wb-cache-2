500|$|Fluorine is {{the thirteenth}} most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700ppm (parts per million) by mass.

2500|$|The {{cold weather}} {{preceding}} {{and during the}} Great Smog led Londoners to burn more coal than usual to keep warm. Post-war domestic coal tended to be of a relatively low-grade, sulphurous variety (economic necessity meant that better-quality [...] "hard" [...] coals tended to be exported), which increased the amount of sulphur dioxide in the smoke. There were also numerous coal-fired power stations in the Greater London area, including Fulham, Battersea, Bankside, Greenwich and Kingston upon Thames, all of which added to the pollution. According to the UK's Met Office, the following pollutants were emitted each day during the smoggy period: 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 14 tonnes of <b>fluorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> and 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide {{which may have been}} converted to 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or <b>fluorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> [...] Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) {{have to take this}} in account.|$|E

40|$|By oral {{administration}} of various NaF solutions (drinking) to young rats and feeding {{them under the}} same conditions for 50 days, the author measured the tail length and body weight of these animals in different groups {{in order to see}} the influences of fluorine on their growth and investigated them experimentally; and obtained the following results. Along with this experiments the author also gave orally pills of cod-liver oil containg 0. 2 mg NaF to kindergarten children repeatedly for one year with the purpose to prevent their tooth-decay and examined their height, body weight, and the percentage of incidence of tooth-decay. Mesthod: 1. For the experimental animals young rats of about forty days old and weighing about 50 g were selected, and they were divided into four groups each consisting of five males and five females to the total of ten in each group. They were made to drink freely NaF apueous solution of various concentrations at 1000 ppm, 500 ppm, 100 ppm, 10 ppm, and 2 ppm. The duration of the drinking of NaF was for 50 days. Namely, observations were limited to the stage of the most active growth and changes were observed in that period. 2. As for the drinking expeariment of fluorine with kindergarten children, sugarcoated cod-liver oil pillets containing 0. 2 mg NaF, 0. 02 g cod-liver oil, and 500 γ vitamin B(1) were used. These pillets were given to the children on every school day for one year under a controlled supervision with exception of sundays, holidays, summer and winter vacation. Their height and body weight were measured once every month, and the rate of incidence of tooth-decay in these children was examined twice, namely, once before the start of NaF-administration and once immediately after the cessation of the administration. Results: 1. Although there can be recognized no great difference in the change of the tail length in the growing young rats given NaF aqueous solution by drinking at a low concentration as compared with the control, there is a slight accelerating tendency. In the group of rats given large amount of NaF solution by drinking in comparison with the control there can be recognized no marked difference up to 30 day after the start of taking <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound,</b> but thereafter the rate of tail growth tends to be retarded and by the fiftieth day the tail growth is diminished as compared with the control. 2. In the groups of young growing rats given orally a low concentration of NaF solution their body weight increases normally.
