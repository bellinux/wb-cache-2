In addition, Gaalaas and Sparks teamed up with guitarist Jeff Kollman to form the all-instrumental trio Cosmosquad. Gaalaas would also join forces with future Halford guitarist and Damageplan vocalist Patrick Lachman in <b>Diesel</b> <b>Machine.</b> [...] Former Deep Purple bassist and Black Sabbath vocalist, Glenn Hughes, would recruit Gaalaas for the European leg of his 2001 tour which led to Shane working with Hughes and another Purple alumnus, vocalist Joe Lynn Turner, on both HTP studio albums.|$|E
50|$|The Portland, Oregon native was a {{short-lived}} member of Dr. Mastermind, featuring former Wild Dogs vocalist Matt McCourt, before joining his brother, vocalist Tim Lachman, in another local band, Gargoyle, in 1988. Gargoyle {{would move to}} Los Angeles, California in 1990 where the band morphed into State Of The Art recording an acclaimed 3-song demo before disbanding in 1993. The Lachman brothers next hooked up with Canada native Shane Gaalaas, then the drummer for Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen, and recorded another demo under the name Eleventh Hour. In 1996, Lachman and Gaalaas teamed up with former Last Rites and World In Pain members A.J. Cavalier (later to join SOiL) and Jeff Mohr to form Diesel and cut a 6-song demo. Parting ways with Mohr and adding Rich Gonzales, formerly with Recipients Of Death, on bass, the band would change their name to <b>Diesel</b> <b>Machine</b> {{in time for the}} release of their debut album, Torture Test, in 2001. By then Lachman had already been picked as one of the guitar players for Halford, the solo band of then ex-Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford.|$|E
40|$|A {{review on}} reutilization of heat waste from a <b>diesel</b> <b>machine</b> is {{absolutely}} important. This {{is because the}} exhaust gas potential of a <b>Diesel</b> <b>machine</b> keeps increasing and not much has been utilized by the industry. One of the techniques of reutilizing the heat waste in industry is by using a heat exchanger. The technique is also very useful for the environment because it can reduce air pollution caused by the exhaust gas of the <b>diesel</b> <b>machine.</b> The main purpose of the research {{is to find out}} the capability of shell and multi-tube helical coil HE as an air heater by utilizing the exhaust gas of the <b>Diesel</b> <b>machine.</b> The heat exchanger of shell and multi-tube helical coil utilizes the exhaust thermal gas of the <b>Diesel</b> <b>machine</b> as the air heater already made. The apparatus has the following dimension: the shell length of 1. 05 m, diameter 0. 1524 m, tube length of 3. 25 m with 20 coils, tube diameter of 0. 011 m, coil diameter of 0. 0508 m with 4 helical coils. The type of <b>Diesel</b> <b>machine</b> to use in the testing is 4 FB 1 Isuzu Diesel engine. The machine has the maximum machine power and rotation of 54 kW and 3, 600 rpm. The performance testing of heat exchanger has been conducted in some variations of <b>Diesel</b> <b>machine</b> rotations of 1, 500 rpm, 1, 750 rpm, 2, 000 rpm, 2, 250 rpm and 2, 500 rpm. The testing result shows a maximum effectiveness to happen at the machine rotation of 1, 500 rpm. The maximum effectiveness to get is 67. 8 % and then it goes down drastically in accordance with the increase of air mass flow rate. The hot air temperature created is from 47. 1 °C to 52. 3 °C {{so that it can be}} used for the purpose of drying up the unhulled rice...|$|E

40|$|Through the {{combination}} of various optical diagnostic techniques an analysis has been undertaken {{of the effects of}} incylinder and injection pressures on the formation and combustion of diesel sprays at realistic automotive in-cylinder conditions. The results were obtained with high-speed video and phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) of the liquid phase, high-speed schlieren video of the vapour phase, high-speed video of autoignition and laser-induced incandescence (LII) of soot. Output results containing spray dispersion angles, droplet sizes and velocities, tip penetrations with time, autoignition delays and relative soot concentrations are presented offering an insight into the common rail diesel spray formation, mixing and combustion processes. The tests were performed on a single-cylinder 2. 2 litre rapid compression <b>diesel</b> <b>machine</b> with optical access to the combustion chamber. A common rail injection system was used with an injector mounted with a single-hole nozzle. The injection pressure was varied from 60 to 160 MPa, the in-cylinder pressure and temperature at top dead centre from 2 to 10 MPa and from 540 to 720 K, respectively. The results obtained from the various optical measurement techniques were comb ined in order to produce a comprehensive observation of diesel spray development and combustion...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha Curcas is a non-edible {{plant that}} can be used for {{renewable}} or alternative energy. The seeds of Jatropha contain up to 60 percent oil. The oil can be converted into biodiesel by well-known two-step using acid-base catalytic transesterification. This paper shows the combustion performance of biodiesel derived from Jatropha oil in an oil burner designed for conventional diesel. Biodiesel used in this study is a blend of diesel with Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) and combustion performance was measured and compared with that of conventional diesel fuel (CDF). The combustion performance of Jatropha biodiesel is based on wall temperature profiles and the amount of gaseous emissions emitted such as nitrous oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). It was demonstrated that biodiesel derived from Jatropha is comparable to the combustion properties of CDF and has high potential to be used as alternative fuel for <b>diesel</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

50|$|The first quarry was for {{iron ore}} {{close to the}} road between the railway and Sproxton Church and worked its way eastwards until 1961. The quarry was {{extended}} eastwards and southwards between 1965 and 1968 but for the getting of limestone rather than iron ore. A second iron ore quarry operated {{on the south side}} of the Skillington road between 1961 and 1973, again working eastwards. A further iron ore quarry was worked on the north side of the railway between 1962 and 1963 again working eastward from the Saltby road. The ore was taken to the railway by standard gauge tramways, worked by horses from 1925 to 1928, then by a petrol engined locomotive and from 1931 by steam locomotives. From 1961 some of the ore was taken to the railway by lorry and from October 1963 the last of the tramways was abandoned and all of the stone was taken to the railway by lorry. Steam quarrying machines were used until 1940 when electric and <b>diesel</b> <b>machines</b> were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Iron Ore was quarried to {{the east}} of Halstead {{on the north side of}} the Oakham Road between 1880 and about 1900, between 1912 and 1921 and between 1924 and 1961. Between 1880 and 1950 the {{quarries}} were on the west side of railway and from 1950 to 1961 on the east side. At first the ore was taken by standard gauge tramway to a tipping stage north of Tilton station where it was tipped into railway wagons in sidings. Horses pulled wagons on the tramway. From 1912 a narrow gauge tramway was used, still with horse haulage. Steam locomotives replaced the horses in 1928 which operated until 1950 [...] When the new quarries in the east of the railway were opened in that year and the old tramway closed, the ore was taken to the tipping dock by lorries which crossed over the railway by a new Bailey Bridge. Quarrying was done by hand with the aid of explosives until 1933 when a petrol parafin machine was brought in. From 1936 <b>diesel</b> <b>machines</b> were used.|$|R
