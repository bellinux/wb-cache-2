40|$|Malaria is {{the major}} {{tropical}} pathology in developing countries and man used the medicinal properties of many plants to fight this disease. During an ethnopharmacological survey in 13 villages of Issia, a Department of Côte-d’Ivoire, 37 traditional healers were interviewed. They used 32 plants to develop 32 monospecific receipts to treat malaria. Leaves and stem barks are more requested. The preparation of the medicamentous receipts utilizes mainly decoctions (81. 81 %). The majority of the remedies are employed by oral way, particularly out of drink (93. 93 %). For each plant, 100 g of powdered material were extracted three times in ethanol. The combined extracts were filtered and concentrated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. The ethanolic extracts were tested against chloroquine-resistant FcB 1 / Colombia strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Extracts were prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and serially diluted with culture medium before {{to be added to}} asynchronous parasite cultures (1 % antiparasitemia and 1 % final hematocrite) in 96 -well microplates. The growth inhibition for each extract concentration was determined by comparison of the radioactivity incorpored into the treated culture with that in the control culture maintained on the plate.

30|$|In this scenario, Nepal is a {{storehouse}} {{of natural}} medicinal plants. It is a multiethnic nation. Ethnomedicine {{is the study}} of medicinal plants used by ethnic groups or indigenous societies for the treatment and cure of various ailments. The ethnic groups are rich in indigenous knowledge and it is deeply rooted in their tradition and cultures. Ethno botanical knowledge on various plants acquired by their self-experience is rapidly eroding {{due to the lack of}} communication between the scientific community and indigenous communities (Bhattarai et al. 2006, 2009). A particular ethnic group may be knowledgeable on one or a few such medicinal properties of a plant but not about all the plants. As a result, there is a curcial need to document such ethnomedicinal or traditional medicinal practices, before they get lost either due to ethnic extinctions or extinctions of an ethnomedicinally used plant species. The phytochemical research based on <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information</b> is considered as an effective approach in the discovery of new agents from higher plants (Chen et al. 2008; Duraipiyan et al. 2006). Ethnomedicinal documentation combined with screening of their antibacterial and antioxidant properties is one convincing way to discover newer drugs, especially in this age of emergence of new diseases (like Ebola) or multi drug resistant pathogens or disease related to oxidative stress such as cancer and Alzheimer. The effectiveness of phytochemicals in the treatment of various diseases may lie in their antioxidant effects because oxidative stress is associated with pathogenic mechanisms of many diseases including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and inflammatory diseases, as well as aging processes. Antioxidants can delay, inhibit or prevent the oxidation of oxidizable materials by scavenging free radicals and diminishing oxidative damage (Duracková 2010).|$|E

Current study provides significant <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information,</b> both qualitative and quantitative on medical plants related to children disorders from district Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan. The information gathered was quantitatively analyzed using informant consensus factor, relative frequency of citation and use value method to establish a baseline data for more comprehensive investigations of bioactive compounds of indigenous medicinal plants specifically related to children disorders. To best of our knowledge it is first attempt to document ethno-botanical information of medicinal plants using quantitative approaches. Total of 130 informants were interviewed using questionnaire conducted during 2014 – 2016 to identify the preparations and uses of the medicinal plants for children diseases treatment. A total of 55 species of flowering plants belonging to 49 genera and 32 families were used as ethno-medicines in the study area. The largest number of specie belong to Leguminosae and Cucurbitaceae families (4 species each) followed by Apiaceae, Moraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, and Solanaceae (3 species each). In addition leaves and fruits are most used parts (28 %), herbs are most used life form (47 %), decoction method were used for administration (27 %), and oral ingestion was the main used route of application (68. 5 %). The highest use value was reported for species Momordica charantia and Raphnus sativus (1 for each) and highest Informant Consensus Factor was observed for cardiovascular and rheumatic diseases categories (0. 5 for each). Most of the species {{in the present study were}} used to cure gastrointestinal diseases (39 species). The results of present study revealed the importance of medicinal plant species and their significant role in the health care of the inhabitants in the present area.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} Neem (Azadirachta indica; Meliaceae) {{is widely}} {{known for its}} cold pressed seed oil, mainly used as insecticide, but also for cosmetic, medicinal and agricultural uses. The seed oil is widely employed in the Indian subcontinent, and the leaves {{seem to have a}} lower relevance, but the ethnobotanical information of Bali (Indonesia) considers the utilisation of leaves for medicinal properties. Aim of the study We report <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information</b> about current uses of neem, in particular of the leaves, besides the insecticidal one, we discuss on the historical background of their uses. Materials and methods Ethnobotanical data were collected using both literature and scientific references and semi-structured interviews with 50 informants (ages ranged between 14 and 76 years old) through the snowball method in thirteen aga (indigenous Balinese) villages, following Ethic code procedures. The informants were asked to specify: which part of the plant was used, and how that plant part was used. Plant specimens were collected, identified and made into herbarium voucher. In consideration of the high variability and complex chemical constituent of neem, a HPTLC analysis of neem leaves coming from both the Indonesian island of Bali and the Indian subcontinent was carried out. Results The data on the medical use of traditional preparations from leaves of neem display a wide spectrum of applications. In the Indian subcontinent, neem leaves are used to treat dental and gastrointestinal disorders, malaria fevers, skin diseases, and as insects repellent, while the Balinese used neem leaves as a diuretic and for diabetes, headache, heartburn, and stimulating the appetite. Differences in utilisation cannot be related to chemical differences and other constituents besides limonoids must be investigated and related to the multipurpose activity of neem. Conclusion This study revealed that neem leaves are believed to treat diabetes in both Balinese and Indian communities. Limonoids can not be considered the only responsible of digestive properties.

40|$|An {{emerging}} field {{devoted to}} {{the exploration of the}} archaeological record for evidence of medicinal plants. In the future, archaeology will have a role in pharmaceutical research. In the late twentieth century, much of the world’s pharmaceutical research has been based on ethnographic documentation of tribally recognized medicinal plants. Once the active chemical compounds in the plants are identified, they are either extracted or synthesized for commercial use. The American film Medicine Man depicts this approach. As shown in the film, such pharmacological research is threatened by declining tribal populations with loss of traditional herbal knowledge coupled with declining biodiversity. With the loss of <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information,</b> the knowledge of ancient cultures can be tapped through archaeology. Every prehistoric culture had some sort of healthcare system, and a pharmacopoeia was integral in each ancient cultural system. Most medicinal compounds used were derived from plants. In theory, the archaeological record can be used to identify medicinal plants used in ancient times. In practice, new archaeological research has demonstrated the presence of anomalous plant finds that, under scrutiny, prove to have had a medicinal use. Therefore, the reserve knowledge of medicinal plants can be expanded by exploring the archaeological record for relevant botanical remains. The paleopharmacological approach compares archaeological data with ethnographic and plantchemistry data. Through this approach, researchers identify specific ailments treated with plant extracts and identify the physiologically active compounds in the plant. Thus, paleopharmacology employs archaeological and ethnographic investigation of the ancient use of medicinal plants in the light of what is known about plant chemistry and physiology. The paleopharmacological record also includes textual information from ancient cultures that document medicinal plant usage. Most documentation of pharmacopoeias comes from the Old World. For example, Morris Weiss and Raoul Perrot have separately summarized aspects of Etruscan medicine and medieval medicine, respectively. In A. D. 77, Dioscorides (Greek physician and pharmacologist) wrote the De Materia Medica, which summarized Greco-Roman knowledge of medicinal plants. Medieval medical practitioners based their Materia Medicalis on this work. The Greeks and Romans were influenced by the herbal knowledge of the Egyptians. In 1989, Lise Manniche summarized the Egyptian pharmacopoeia from several Egyptian texts, including the Papyrus Ebers, which dates to 1550 B. C. At least three Aztec documents describe a New World pharmacopoeia that was studied by Bernard Ortiz de Montellano in 1975...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of ethnopharmacological, phytochemical and biological activities investigations on Opilia celtidifolia (Guill. & Perr.) Endl. ex Walp (Opiliaceae), Cola cordifolia(Cav.) R. Br. (Sterculiaceae), and Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae), three plants used in traditional medicine in Mali to cure various types of diseases. The first part of this thesis deals with the results of ethnopharmacological surveys performed to identify the traditional uses of these plants. These studies covered different areas of Mali (Siby Dioila, Kolokani, Dogonland, and Koutiala) and their results showed extended uses of the plants. O. celtidifolia was mostly identified by traditional healers as an anti malaria, appetizer, and anti dermatitis plant and C. cordifolia was reported to cure gastritis, skin inflammation, wounds, malaria, high blood pressure, overweight and other diseases as well. The <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information</b> of E. senegalensis was related mostly to amenorrhoea, bilharzias and other types of infections, malaria and jaundice. The fidelity level among traditional healers from the same area about the most reported diseases was calculated. A high healer agreement (75 %) was found about the use of O. celtidifolia against dermatitis in Siby, against malaria in Dioila (61 %), and abdominal pain (54 %) in the same area. The use of E. senegalensis against amenorrhoea meets 21 % of agreement between Dioila and Kolokani. The second part of this thesis {{presents the}} results of structural and immunological properties investigations of pectic polysaccharide fractions isolated from the water 50 ˚C extract of O. celtidifolia and C. cordifolia. These plants were previously reported to be used to treat internal and external chronic wounds. It is known from the literature that the plants which are used against wounds and other immune related diseases in traditional medicine are likely to contain immunomodulatory compounds, and polysaccharides are largely reported to be responsible of these activities. Two acidic polysaccharide fractions were isolated from the leaves extract of O. celtidifolia,Oc 50 A 1 and Oc 50 A 2. They showed, strong complement fixing ability, the ICH 50 values were 0. 5 and 0. 9 g/ml respectively; nitric oxide release ability from activated macrophages, a concentration of 100 g/ml induced the release of about 7. 3 M of NO. The fractions induced 14 and 24 % respectively of proliferation of T cells at 50 g/ml and moderate B cell activation property at 100 g/ml as well. Analysis of the monosaccharide composition of Oc 50 A 1 and Oc 50 A 2 showed the presence of arabinose (26. 7 and 13. 2 %), galactose (31. 5 and 28 %) and galacturonic acid (5. 3 and 7. 8 %) respectively. The Yariv test confirmed the presence of arabinogalactan type II in both fractions. Structural analyses did also show the presence of terminal and 1 - 4 linked galacturonic acid and terminal and 1 - 2 linked rhamnose. Endo-polygalacturonanase treatment was performed to isolate the heavily substituted parts of the polysaccharides. These parts contained the same monosaccharides in similar proportion, and showed stronger dose dependent complement fixing activity and also stimulated macrophages to release nitrite oxide. A pectic polysaccharide Cc 50 - 1 with a molecular weight between 1000 and 2000 kDa was isolated from C. cordifolia. Monosaccharide composition and linkages analysis showed the presence of unusual type of monomers. 20 % of terminally and 3 -linked 2 -O-methyl galactose, 18 % of terminally linked 4 -O-methyl glucuronic acid and 2 % of 2 -O-methyl fucose were identified. These monomers seem to be linked to a RGI like backbone composed of 20 % of 2, 3 - and 2, 4 -linked rhamnose almost equal amount, which alternate with 24 % of 4 -linked galacturonic acid some of which also carry side chains. This polysaccharide showed low complement fixing ability with an ICH 50 value of 480 g/ml. Viscosity measurement gave a Huggins constant value of K´= 1. 2 which indicated the presence of aggregated particles when Cc 50 - 1 is dissolved in water based solvents. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, results of phytochemical and biological investigations on low molecular weight compounds isolated from E. senegalensis are presented. A new pterocarpan named Erybraedin F and six known ones, erybraedin A, C, D, eryvarin K, phaseollin and shinpterocarpin and a flavone, carpachromene were isolated from the dichloromethane extracts of the root and stem bark. The pterocarpans showed 15 -lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition activity. The IC 50 values ranged between 32 and 82 M. Erybraedin D (IC 50 < 32) was stronger enzyme inhibitor than quercetin (IC 50 = 42 M). Erybraedin A, D, C and eryvarin K also showed positive inhibition results on Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds is in good agreement with literature data. These compounds although reported before in the genus Erythrina are for the first time here reported in the species E. senegalensis and the first time reported to have 15 -LO inhibition activity...|$|E

Sandwith (Menispermaceae) conhecida como abuta ou abota, é uma planta {{medicinal}} amazônica utilizada contra doenças do aparelho reprodutor feminino, como antiinflamatório, antidiabético e outros. O estudo anatômico e etnofarmacológico de plantas medicinais são relevantes, pois visam esclarecer as propriedades, aplicações e usos terapêuticos dos vegetais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi obter informações etnofarmacológicas da abuta em Manaus e caracterizar anatomicamente os seus órgãos vegetativos. O material botânico foi coletado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke (Manaus-AM). O estudo etnofarmacológico foi realizado nos principais mercados e feiras de Manaus, através de entrevistas semi-estruturadas e abertas, com comerciantes e usuários de plantas medicinais. Para o estudo anatômico, amostras de folha, caule e raiz foram coletadas de 5 indivíduos de A. grandifolia. Amostras das lâminas foliares foram diafanizadas, dissociadas e também processadas para observação ao microscópio eletrônico de varredura (MEV), conforme metodologia usual. Fragmentos do caule e raiz foram incluídos em polietilenoglicol 2000 (PEG 2000), para obtenção de cortes em micrótomo de deslize, os quais foram corados com azul de astra e safranina, montados em Bálsamo do Canadá. Cortes frescos de caule e raiz foram submetidos a testes microquímicos, visando identificar substâncias químicas secretadas, assim como em cortes frescos da folha. Idiblastos secretores estão presentes na nervura central, pecíolo e pulvino das folhas de A. grandifolia. A raiz tem periderme, córtex parenquimático com células pétreas, feixes vasculares colaterais, formando um anel e cercados por esclerênquima, o parênquima radial com células de paredes espessas e lignificadas e medula ausente.

Sandwith (Menispermaceae) {{known as}} abuta or abota, is an Amazonian medicinal plant used against {{diseases of the}} feminine reproductive apparel, as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and other. The ethnopharmacological and anatomical study of medicinal plants are relevant, to explain of they seek of because as properties, applications and therapeutic uses of the vegetables. The objective of this work was to obtain <b>ethnopharmacological</b> <b>information</b> of the abuta in Manaus and to characterize anatomically their vegetative organs. The botanical material was collected in the Forest Reservation Adolpho Ducke (Manaus-AM). The ethnopharmacological study was carried at the main markets and fairs of Manaus, through semi-structured interviews and open, with merchants and users of medicinal plants. For the anatomical study were collected samples of leaf, stem and root of 5 individuals of A. grandifolia. Samples of leaf lamina were cleared, dissociated and also processed for Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) view, following usual methodology. Fragments of the stem and root were included in polyethylenglycol 2000 (PEG 2000), for sectionings in a sliding microtome, stained with astra blue and safranina, mounted with Balm of Canada. Fresh cuts of stem and root were submitted to microchemical tests, to identify the chemical nature of the secreted compounds, {{as well as in}} fresh cuts of the leaf. Are present secretory sacs in pulvine, petiole and main vein. The root with periderm, parenchymatous cortex with stone cells, collateral vascular bundles, forming the ring and surrounded by sclerenchyma, radial parenchyma with cells of thick walls and lignified medulla is absent. The young stem possess epidermi with cells of thick walls and lignified, presents thick cuticle, parenchyma tous cortex with sclerenchymatous tissues, collateral vascular bundles surrounded by sclerenchymatous fibres, tylosis, radial parenchyma with lignified cells of thick walls and medular parenchyma. The epidermis of leaf lamina is uniseriate with lignified and thick walls cells, covered by cuticle, estomata in the lower limb surface; homogeneous mesophyll with collateral vascular bundles covered by sclerenchymatous hem. Petiole and pulvine with epidermis covered by cuticle layer thick, stone cells in the cortical parenchyma of pulvine and layers of fibers in the petiole, with larger number of layers in the pulvine; both with collateral vascular bundles surrounded by an arch of sclerenchymatous fibres. The microchemical tests confirmed starch in all of the studied organs; phenolic compounds in the secretory sacs of the leaf; pectin substances in the vessels of xylem of the stem and root and in the cells in sclerification process of the pulvine; alkaloid in the sclerenchymatous cells of the cortical parenchyma and in cells of the ray of the stem and the root, and lipids in the cuticle of the leaf and stem. In agreement with the ethnopharmacological informations obtained, the abuta little is known and used by the users of medicinal plants, it is marketed in nature, used mainly as anti-inflammatory, in the form of tea or infusion of their leaves and/or stem. The main users of the species are women. The merchants' knowledge regarding the medicinal plants is inherited of relatives or acquired through courses and specialized books.
