40|$|Standard OT {{learning}} algorithms such as RCD or GLA use {{a single}} total ordering or partial ordering (stratified hierarchy) of constraints as the hypothesis about the grammar. As is well known, this necessarily leads to overcommitment, because certain datasets (think of a comparative row like [W, W, L]) impose irreducibly <b>disjunctive</b> <b>conditions</b> {{on what a}} ranking compatible with the data should be. As the result, learning is never conservative, and hypotheses often have to be rolled back even when the data are perfectly consistent. At the same time, {{it is clear that}} we could in principle use the set of all total rankings compatible with the data as a conservative hypothesis, but no method for working with such sets was developed other than brute force ones. And those are both computationally heavy, and unintuitive: it is not easy for humans to work with amorphous sets of total rankings. As the result, even most basic facts about sets of rankings which constitute faithful, non-overcommiting grammar hypotheses for tableaux, were not known: for instance, which sets of rankings can be such hypotheses, and which cannot correspond to any tableau at all. This paper overcomes the technical problems of working with sets of total rankings, and develops methods which allow to use them as full-fledged grammar hypotheses, and thus enable learnin...|$|R

Our main contribution {{is the concept}} of "Query Race": we split up a general query into several single attribute queries, and exploit concurrency and speed to bind the complexity to the fastest of them. Our method supports selection queries with general composition of conjunctive and <b>disjunctive</b> order-based <b>conditions</b> on different attributes at the same time. To achieve our results, we require neither previous knowledge of queries nor specific support by the DBMS.

Coupling query may be used for querying both HTML and XML documents. One of the important feature of our query mechanism is the ability to express conjunctive as well as <b>disjunctive</b> query <b>conditions</b> compactly. We {{describe how}} to formulate a coupling query in text form as well as pictorially using the coupling text and the coupling graph respectively. We explore the limitations of coupling graph with respect to the coupling text. We found out that AND, OR and AND/ORcoupling graphs are less expressive than their textual counterparts. To address this shortcoming we introduce the notion of hybrid graph which is a special type of pconnected coupling graph. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a GUI-based system called VISCOUS (VISual COupling QU ery System) for formulating such queries...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a query mechanism called coupling query to glean relevant Web data in the context of our web warehousing system called Warehouse Of Web Data (WHOWEDA). Coupling query may be used for querying both HTML and XML documents. Some of the important features of our query mechanism are ability to query metadata, content, internal and external (hyperlink) structure of Web documents based on partial knowledge, ability to express constraints on tag attributes and tagless segment of data, ability to express conjunctive as well as <b>disjunctive</b> query <b>conditions</b> compactly, ability to control execution of a web query and preservation of the topological structure of hyperlinked documents in the query results. We also discuss how to formulate query graphically and in textual form using coupling graph and coupling text, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the prior causal knowledge of subjects on the rate of learning, the categories formed, and the attributes attended to during learning is explored. Conjunctive concepts {{are thought to be}} easier for subjects to learn than <b>disjunctive</b> concepts. <b>Conditions</b> are reported under which the opposite occurs. In particular, it is demonstrated that prior knowledge can influence the rate of concept learning and that the {{influence of}} prior causal knowledge can dominate the {{influence of the}} logical form. A computational model of this learning task is presented. In order to represent the prior knowledge of the subjects, an extension to explanation-based learning is developed to deal with imprecise domain knowledge.

40|$|Downward entailing {{linguistic}} environments license inferences from sets {{to their}} subsets. These environments also determine {{the interpretation of}} disjunction: Disjunction licenses a conjunctive entailment in the scope of downward entailing operators (Crain 2008, 2012). This leads to a striking asymmetry across languages {{in the interpretation of}} disjunction when it appears in the restrictor (downward entailing) versus the nuclear scope (non-downward entailing) of the universal quantifier such as English every and Mandarin mei. The present study investigated Mandarin-speaking children's interpretation of the disjunction word huozhe in sentences with the universal quantifier mei. The main findings were that young Mandarin-speaking children assigned the conjunctive entailment to huozhe when it appeared in the restrictor of mei. Moreover, they allowed the <b>disjunctive</b> truth <b>conditions</b> of huozhe in the nuclear scope of mei. Altogether, children's asymmetric responses in the two arguments of mei suggest that Mandarin-speaking children, like adults, are aware of the semantic property of downward entailment at an early age. Along with previous cross-linguistic studies, the findings of the present paper provide further evidence for the view that the semantic 'core' property of downward entailment (a) applies in different linguistic communities, and (b) appears at an early stage of language development. 33 page(s...|$|R

The {{objectives of the}} study are to classify the types of conjunction found on Inside the Kingdom dan Di dalam Kerajaan and to describe the translation equivalence of conjunction translation in Inside the Kingdom and their translation. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. The objects of the research are conjunctions found in Inside the Kingdom and it’s translation Di Dalam Kerajaan. The data are in the forms of conjunctions used in phrases, clauses, and sentences. They are collected from both the books by using document method. She applies comparison method in analyzing the data of the study. The results of data analysis show that firstly, {{there are two types}} of conjunction, namely: coordinate and subordinate conjunction. These conjunctions are then classified based on their uses in phrases, clauses, and sentences as cumulative, adversative, illative, <b>disjunctive,</b> cause/reason, comparison, <b>condition,</b> adversative, time, and purpose.

40|$|Periodicity, primitivity and borderedness {{are some}} of the {{fundamental}} notions in combinatorics on words. Motivated by the Watson-Crick complementarity of DNA strands wherein a word (strand) over the DNA alphabet {A, G, C, T} and its Watson-Crick complement are informationally "identical 2 ̆ 2, these notions have been extended to consider pseudo-periodicity and pseudo-borderedness obtained by replacing the "identity 2 ̆ 2 function with "pseudo-identity 2 ̆ 2 functions (antimorphic involution in case of Watson-Crick complementarity). For a given alphabet Σ, an antimorphic involution θ is an antimorphism, i. e., θ(uv) =θ(v) θ(u) for all u,v ∈Σ^* and an involution, i. e., θ(θ(u)) =u for all u ∈Σ^*. In this thesis, we continue the study of pseudo-periodic and pseudo-bordered words for pseudo-identity functions including involutions. To start with, we propose a binary word operation, θ-catenation, that generates θ-powers (pseudo-powers) of a word for any morphic or antimorphic involution θ. We investigate various properties of this operation including closure properties of various classes of languages under it, and its connection with the previously defined notion of θ-primitive words. A non-empty word u is said to be θ-bordered if there exists a non-empty word v which is a prefix of u while θ(v) is a suffix of u. We investigate the properties of θ-bordered (pseudo-bordered) and θ-unbordered (pseudo-unbordered) words for pseudo-identity functions θ with the property that θ is either a morphism or an antimorphism with θ^n=I, for a given n ≥ 2, or θ is a literal morphism or an antimorphism. Lastly, we initiate a new line of study by exploring the disjunctivity properties of sets of pseudo-bordered and pseudo-unbordered words and some other related languages for various pseudo-identity functions. In particular, we consider such properties for morphic involutions θ and prove that, for any i ≥ 2, the set of all words with exactly i θ-borders is <b>disjunctive</b> (under certain <b>conditions)</b> ...|$|R
