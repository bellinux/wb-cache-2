40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to study the changes {{of the content of}} {{biogenic}} amines during winemaking and maturation processes of wines made from Vitis vinifera cv Sauvignon grapes from Slavonia region (vintage 2008). Biogenic amines were quantified using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection after pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). Samples used in this study were obtained during production of Sauvignon wines in three different ways in order to produce quality wine (QW), quality press wine (QPW) and macerated wines (MW). The QPW corresponds to the first fraction obtained by <b>direct</b> <b>pressing</b> pomace, while the QW is the free run wine. The MW was obtained by grape mash cryomaceration. Putrescine and tryptamine were the most prevalent amines, followed by histamine, cadaverine and tyramine. The macerated wine posses higher content of biogenic amines than press and free run wines. In all analysed wines the content of biogenic amines tends to increase during winemaking and maturation and the main increase was detected during the malolactic fermentation.

Also claimed is a second similar {{process in which the}} second component is a soft metallic/elemental powder, the process comprising (a) mixing the individual powders in a stoichiometric ratio such that the base component powder particles are enclosed by the soft powder particles; and (b) compacting the powder mixture to a component or body, shaping with a deformation ratio of about 20 and machining the body transverse to the shaping direction to produce material or powder which is subjected to uniaxial pressing and pressure-less sintering. ADVANTAGE - The processes permit production of high density, non-porous intermetallic phase components from inexpensive starting materials by pressure-less sintering, without expansion during intermetallic phase formation and with isotropic shrinkage characteristics during heat treatment.

40|$|There is a pervading {{sense of}} unease that artificially {{intelligent}} machines will soon radically alter {{our lives in}} ways that are still unknown. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology are developing at an extremely rapid rate as computational power continues to grow exponentially. Even if existential concerns about AI do not materialize, there are enough concrete examples of problems associated with current applications of AI to warrant concern about the level of control that exists over developments in this field. Some form of regulation is likely necessary to protect society from harm. However, advances in regulatory capacity have not kept pace with developments in new technologies, including AI. This is partly because regulation has become decentered; that is, the traditional role of public regulators such as governments commanding regulation has dissipated, and other participants including those from within the industry have taken the lead. Other contributing factors are dwindling government resources on one hand and the increased power of technology companies on the other. These factors have left the field of AI development relatively unregulated. Whatever the reason, it is now more difficult for traditional public regulatory bodies to control the development of AI. In the vacuum, industry participants have begun to self-regulate by promoting soft law options such as codes of practice and standards. This Article argues that despite the reduced authority of public regulatory agencies, the risks associated with runaway AI require regulators to begin to participate in what is largely an unregulated field. In an environment where resources are scarce, governments or public regulators must develop new ways of regulating. This Article proposes solutions to regulating the development of AI ex ante through a two-step process: first, governments can set expectations and send signals to influence participants in AI development. The Authors adopt the term “nudging” to refer to this type of influencing. Second, public regulators must participate in and interact with the relevant industries. By doing this, they can gather information and knowledge about the industries, begin to assess risks, and then {{be in a position to}} regulate those areas that pose the most risk first. To conduct a proper risk analysis, regulators must have sufficient knowledge and understanding about the target of regulation to be able to classify various risk categories. The Authors have proposed an initial classification based on the literature that can help to <b>direct</b> <b>pressing</b> issues for further research and a deeper understanding of the various applications of AI and the relative risks they pose...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality due to the cancer and coronary heart disease is recognized as the increasing challenge in the world. The initial stage of these diseases, early diagnosis and treatment are the main objectives of current researches. According to Lithuanian Health Information Centre {{morbidity and mortality}} due to these diseases in Lithuania exceed average of European Union. The oxidative stress occurs in cells as a result of normal physiological processes and environmental interactions, and the complex antioxidant defense system are of particular importance in protecting biological systems against oxidative damage by free radicals. Recently polyphenols and anthocyanins containing foods and preparations have attracted attention due to their health promoting benefits. Anthocyanins make one of the main groups of flavonoids, and represent polyphenolic compounds, that are found in vegetables and fruits, particularly in berries. An important effect of anthocyanins is the scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals. They can interfere with few different free radical-producing systems, and can increase the function of the endogenous antioxidants. The aim of the research is to choose sources for the products with antioxidant activity from plants cultivated in Lithuania, evaluate quality and antioxidant activity of black currant, red currant and chokeberry products, to develop and evaluate technologies of phytopharmaceuticals with antioxidant activity. Innovation and practical significance of the research. Antioxidant activity of Lithuanian black currant, red currant and chokeberry berries concentrated juices was evaluated for the first time. There were applied DPPH and ABTS methods for these products. These results will bring antioxidant activity data performed by world scientists up-to-date. Dry product from Lithuanian black currant berries juices was made by spry draying. Production of tablets with black currant polyphenols (and athocyanins) was made {{for the first time in}} Lithuania. Two products with antioxidant activity were prepared for industry: tablets with standardized extract of black currant and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of black currant and vitamin premix (vitamins E, C and β-carotene). Experimental series of tablets was produced, quality and stability was evaluated. Composition of tablet was optimized by experimental design. Scientific technological documentation for tablets with standardized extract of black currant and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of black currant and vitamin premix was prepared. Results The stability of polyphenols and anthocyanins is significantly influenced by storage conditions of black currant and chokeberry concentrated juices. It is recommended to store black currant and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. The results demonstrated insufficient stability of juice concentrates, and impossibility of application of long lasting drying processes in black currant and chokeberry berries dry products manufacturing. Fast and efficient drying methods for liquid products should be applied to preserve qualitative and quantitative composition and their antioxidant activity. Only complex approach to quality evaluation of natural origin products presents reliable basis for establishment of product value. Determined contents of polyphenols and anthocyanins in black currant product were higher and it possessed stronger antioxidant activity if compared to chokeberry. Therefore black currant concentrated juice was chosen for further processing and development of solid dosage form possessing antioxidant activity. Spray drying procedure was performed in Medical University of Gdansk, department of Pharmaceutical technology (Poland). Spry drier „ANHYDRO“ type LAB – S 1 (Denmark) was used for this procedure. Black currant juice concentrate was diluted with water (1 : 1) and 10 % of amorphous silica was admixed to the water-diluted concentrate. The resulting powder was dry and non-sticky. Other used product was black currant extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins. Conclusions Researches were performed at 2001 - 2005. During this period there were analyzed and evaluated black currant (Ribes nigrum L.), chokeberry (Chokeberry melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) and red currant (Ribes rubrum L.) berries concentrated juices as raw material for production of preparations with antioxidant activity. There were produced tablets with spry dried black currant berries juices; tablets with black currant extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins; and tablets with standardized (7 % anthocyanins) black currant extract and vitamin (E, C, β-carotene) mixture. Quality and stability of these tablets were evaluated. It can be concluded: 1. Black currant extract was chosen for production of antioxidant preparations. Results showed higher amount of polyphenols 3786, 25 ± 180 mg/l GAE (p= 0, 0193) and antioxidant activity 78, 49 ± 3, 9 % (p= 0, 0003) of black currant juices then in chokeberry juices. Results showed low antioxidant activity, small amounts polyphenols and anthocyanins of red currant juices. Therefore red currant analysis was not continued. 2. Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods were applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis; Acceptability of these methods was validated for analysis of raw material and stability of tablets. 3. Polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity significantly decreased after storage at 20 ± 0, 5 and 40 ± 0, 5 ºC temperatures. Best stability was determinated at 2 ± 0, 5 ºC temperature (p< 0, 001). It is recommended to store black currant and chokeberry concentrated juices at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. 4. Dependence of antioxidant activity on anthocyanin amount was determinated (r= 0, 76). Anthocyanins in black currant juices were more stabile (p= 0, 0062) then in chokeberry juices. 5. Spray drying was applied for black currant juices, conditions of drying were determinated. Spry dried product is appropriate for production of solid dosage forms due to good technological properties. 6. Tablets with dry concentrate of black currant juices were produced, appropriate excipients were chosen for good quality tablet production by <b>direct</b> <b>pressing.</b> Analysis confirmed quality and stability of tablets with dry concentrate of black currant juices. 7. Two technologies of tablets with standardized black currant extract, standardized black currant extract and vitamin mixture (vitamins E, C and β-carotene) were studied as potential antioxidant phytopharmaceuticals. Tablets technology of these two compositions was established, quality and stability were evaluated. Tablet composition with standardized black currant extract was optimized by orthogonal full factorial design model. Optimal mounts of excipients were determinated: 18, 0 mg of silica, colloidal anhydrous, 3, 5 mg of magnesium stearate and 278, 5 mg of microcrystalline cellulose.

50|$|The {{compelling}} reason for shortening the cycle time then was to avoid grain growth and also save energy.

Additionally, this leads to {{significant increase in the}} sintering activity of fine metal powder aggregates which makes short cycle times of a few minutes possible. Further, this process lowers the threshold sintering temperature and pressure compared to that required in conventional sintering processes.

A few, and they not the least powerful and terrific of the band, threw lowering looks, in which the fiercest passion was only tempered by habitual self-command, at those captives who still remained in their power; while one or two even gave vent to their malignant feelings by the most menacing gestures, against which neither the sex nor the beauty of the sisters was any protection. The young soldier made a desperate, but fruitless effort, to spring to the side of Alice, when he saw the dark hand of a savage twisted in the rich tresses which were flowing in volumes over her shoulders, while a knife was passed around the head from which they fell, as if to denote the horrid manner in which it was about to be robbed of its beautiful ornament. But his hands were bound; and at the first movement he made, he felt the grasp of the powerful Indian who <b>directed</b> the band, <b>pressing</b> his shoulder like a vise. Immediately conscious how unavailing any struggle against such an overwhelming force must prove, he submitted to his fate, encouraging his gentle companions by a few low and tender assurances that the natives seldom failed to threaten more than they performed.|$|R
