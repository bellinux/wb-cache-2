2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an <b>impervious</b> <b>zone.</b> The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The <b>impervious</b> <b>zone</b> may be on the upstream face and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, steel sheet piles, timber or other material. The <b>impervious</b> <b>zone</b> may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E

In the earth fill dam, the seepage is minimized by the <b>impervious</b> <b>zone.</b> That is usually composed of clay soil fine soil. In this research, natural rubber powder SIR. 20 is used to improve the characteristics of <b>impervious</b> <b>zone</b> material i. e. : clay and sand-mo. The tested characteristics of physical and mechanical test by using model at tank permeability. The result show that the addition of rubber powder to clay soil could increase direct shear from 10 o at rate 0 % to 14 o at rate 12, 5 %, permeability coefficient from 5, 97 x 10 - 6 cm/sec to 3, 23 x 10 - 4 cm/sec, seepage flow from 1, 581 x 10 - 5 cm 3 /sec to 8, 57 x 10 - 4 cm 3 / sec, and reduce swelling from 16, 81 % at rate 0 % to 7, 40 % at rate 12, 5 %. Meanwhile, the addition of rubber powder to sand-mo could increased direct shear from 15 o at rate 0 % to 28 o at rate 12, 5 %, and reduce swelling from 14, 85 % at rate 0 % to 4, 78 % at rate 12, 5 %, permeability coefficient from 3, 09 x 10 - 5 cm/sec to 8, 74 x 10 - 6 cm/sec, and seepage flow from 8, 17 x 10 - 5 cm 3 /sec to 2, 31 x 10 - 5 cm 3 / sec. Based on the test result, {{it can be concluded}} that the addition of rubber powder to sand-mo could improve its impervious. In the contrary, addition of rubber powder to clay soil could worsen its impervious...|$|E
40|$|Hydrologic {{models are}} tools that can {{quantify}} the natural flow regime for locations that lack pre-disturbed flow records by matching existing measurements and translating information from areas we have measurements to places that we don’t. With any model application, {{we try to}} balance model complexity, the number of model parameters, with our ability to predict a range of hydrologic processes at fine scales. To address over-parameterization issues that arise from complex models, a sensitivity analysis can be employed to determine which parameters {{are more or less}} important. The objective {{of this study is to}} understand unaltered drainages in the headwater basins of lower Alabama. To understand unaltered drainages we employed the Method of Morris sensitivity analysis for 7 headwater sites within the Gulf of Mexico Basin. At the headwater locations we used the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model to simulate streamflow and compared to existing measurements. The importance of a model parameter was identified based on the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) across multiple elementary effects. By analyzing parameter sensitivity with respect to multiple metrics describing the flow regime, the sensitivity analysis allows us to rank the importance of the 17 model parameters and understand the dominant hydrologic process for unaltered drainages in headwater basins of lower Alabama. In order to account for different flow regimes, performance of watershed models is often evaluated for multiple functions that capture different parts of the hydrograph. The evaluation functions focused on high flow, low flow, and daily flow. Across the 7 mesoscale basins, we were able to identify the dominant parameters for the 6 different evaluation functions. The sensitivity analysis identified 8 PRMS model parameters as highly impactful on streamflow. These model parameters are associated with the soil-zone, subsurface, <b>impervious</b> <b>zone,</b> and the groundwater reservoir of the PRMS model. The main purpose of these parameters is to route water once it hits the land surface either to the stream network or through the soil profile into the groundwater reservoir are the controlling model parameters. Also, we were able to determine the parameters that were considered impactful were dominated by interactions. Due to the interactions, we have difficulty characterizing the model in terms of model parameters because multiple parameter sets are able to produce the same model output. Model interactions complicate the modeling effort and should be considered during calibration. Ultimately, a sensitivity analysis is able aid in model calibration by identifying impactful parameters and reducing the number of parameters to focus on during calibration...|$|E

In addition, by making use of the available monitored pore water pressure data of the first filling of reservoir, back analysis was carried out to estimate the best fit seepage parameters. The estimated parameters were used for further prediction of pore water pressures in subsequent monitored durations with reasonable accuracy.

40|$|The {{documentation}} {{existing on}} both {{land use and}} the delineation of pervious and <b>impervious</b> <b>zones</b> in urban areas tends to be rather complete. In addition, topographical information (altitudes, slopes) is generally available, although contours are not drawn in detail on urban-area maps. The development of urban databases has provided a convenient means of accessing this information {{for the purpose of}} hydrological modelling. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate a recent model, 'SURF' (semi-urbanized runoff flow), specifically developed for coupling with a GIS based on a digital terrain representation. This model was evaluated by use of an original approach from the field of urban hydrology. A 7 -year continuous data series, which includes the dry periods, has been used as input to run the model. The principles behind the SURF model are briefly described herein. A sensitivity analysis is then performed in order to select the most influential parameters. Following the calibration stage, the model's validation is discussed. This validation is conducted not only by comparing observed and simulated hydrographs, but also by comparing the SURF model with a more conventional model in urban hydrology, called the URBAN model. It is demonstrated that the SURF model provides useful simulation results and does outperform the URBAN model. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFractional flow models {{introduced}} by Barker (1988) have been increasingly popular as means of interpreting nonclassical drawdown curves obtained from well tests. Fractional flow models are intrinsically isotropic scaling models depending to first order on two exponents n and dw expressing {{the dimension of}} the structure available to flow and the flow slowdown, respectively. We study the fractional flow induced either by geometrically scaling structures such as Sierpinski- and percolation-like fractal media or by hydraulically scaling media such as long-range continuous correlated media. First, percolation and Sierpinski structures have two well-separated dw values in the range [2. 6, 3] and [1. 9, 2. 5], respectively. The bottlenecks, characteristic of percolation, induce a more anomalous transport (larger dw values) than the <b>impervious</b> <b>zones</b> present at all scales of Sierpinskis. Second, the realization-based values of n and dw depend both on global and on local characteristics like the fractal dimension and the permeability around the well, respectively. Finally, solving the inverse problem on anomalous transient well test responses consists in comparing the (n, dw) realization-based values with field data. Indeed, well tests performed from a unique pumping well must be taken as realization-based results. For the site of Ploemeur (Brittany, France), from which n and dw have been previously determined (Le Borgne et al., 2004), the only consistent model is given by the continuous multifractals. However, the values obtained from continuous multifractals cover most of the (n, dw) plane, and realization-based results are not selective in terms of model. So this should {{be replaced by the}} comparison of (n, dw) values averaged over different pumping well locations, which however requires a significantly larger quantity of field tests...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{with intense}} {{land use and}} land cover (LULC) change and explosive population growth has {{a great impact on}} water quality. The relationship between LULC characteristics and water quality provides important information for non-point sources (NPS) pollution management. In this study, we first quantified the spatial-temporal patterns of five water quality variables in four watersheds with different levels of urbanization in Beijing, China. We then examined the effects of LULC on water quality across different scales, using Pearson correlation analysis, redundancy analysis, and multiple regressions. The results showed that water quality was improved over the sampled years but with no significant difference (p > 0. 05). However, water quality was significantly different among nonurban and both exurban and urban sites (p < 0. 05). Forest land was positively correlated with water quality and affected water quality significantly (p < 0. 05) within a 200 m buffer <b>zone.</b> <b>Impervious</b> surfaces, water, and crop land were negatively correlated with water quality. Crop land and impervious surfaces, however, affected water quality significantly (p < 0. 05) for buffer sizes greater than 800 m. Grass land had different effects on water quality with the scales. The results provide important insights into the relationship between LULC and water quality, and thus for controlling NPS pollution in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|Widespread {{and intense}} zones of silicified, propylitic, and argillic {{alteration}} {{can be found}} in the Çan volcanics of Biga Peninsula, northwest Turkey. Most of the springs in the study area surface out from the boundary between fractured aquifer (silicified <b>zone)</b> and <b>impervious</b> boundary (argillic <b>zone).</b> This study focuses on two such springs in KirazlI area (KirazlI and Balaban springs) with a distinct quality pattern. Accordingly, field parameters (temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity), major anion and cation (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sulfate), heavy metals (aluminum, arsenic, barium, chromium, cobalt, cupper, iron, lithium, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc), and isotopes (oxygen- 18, deuterium, and tritium) were determined in water samples taken from these springs during 2005 through 2007. The chemical analyses showed that aluminum concentrations were found to be two orders of magnitude greater in KirazlI waters (mean value 13813. 25 μg/L). The levels of this element exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in national and international standards for drinking-water quality. In addition, Balaban and KirazlI springs are > 55 years old according to their tritium levels; KirazlI spring is older than Balaban spring. KirazlI spring is also more enriched than Balaban spring based in oxygen- 18 and deuterium values. Furthermore, KirazlI spring water has been in contact with altered rocks longer than Balaban spring water, according to its relatively high chloride and electrical conductivity values. TÜBİTA...|$|R
40|$|Meehan, Christopher L. Compacted clay/sand {{mixtures}} {{can be used}} as engineered fills when constructing earthen levees or embankment dams. They {{are also}} a design option available to engineers that are constructing liner systems or other types of <b>impervious</b> buffer <b>zones</b> for waste disposal projects. For geotechnical engineers that are designing these types of engineered fill systems, it is useful to have an understanding of the engineering behavior of these mixtures {{as a function of the}} soil mixture and compaction process that is utilized. This study investigated the effects of various soil mixtures and compaction conditions on the strength and compressibility characteristics of compacted clay/sand mixtures. The factors investigated include the: clay mineral type, clay content, dry unit weight, compaction moisture content, and compaction energy. To simulate the field compaction process, representative Proctor specimens were prepared for each of the clay/sand mixtures at low, standard, and modified Proctor compaction energy levels. Unconsolidated-undrained triaxial strength tests were conducted at various confining pressures on test specimens prepared from each of the compacted Proctor specimens. One dimensional compression tests were also performed on test specimens prepared from each of the compacted Proctor specimens, to determine the compressibility behavior of each of the compacted soil mixtures. The experimental findings showed that the undrained strength of samples compacted at the same energy level decreased with increasing compaction moisture content. Additionally, the undrained strength increased with increasing confining pressure and compaction energy. The results also indicated that the angles of shearing resistance increased with decreasing moisture content, and were largest for specimens compacted at a very low water content with high compaction energy. The values of the cohesion intercept increased with increasing dry density, clay content, and plasticity of the clay fraction. Due to their differences in soil mineral characteristics and as-compacted soil fabric, kaolinite/sand mixtures exhibited higher φ values and lower c values than bentonite/sand mixtures at the same water content relative to the optimum water content. The values of Young's modulus measured in the triaxial test at 50 % of the strength increased with clay content and were higher for dry-ofoptimum specimens. The compression test results further showed that a large percentage of compression occurred tended to occur within the first minute of loading. The compaction moisture content was found to have a more significant effect on a given mixture's compressibility behavior for samples having a high clay content.

40|$|Urban landscapes {{are complex}} and dynamic systems, and in areas of strong human {{population}} growth urban areas are undergoing rapid expansion. Increases in impervious surface area (e. g. roads, buildings, and parking lots) are typically associated with urban expansion, and usually represent irreversible change on the landscape. These impervious surface areas provide services to urban residents, but also have environmental consequences, including alteration of urban stream hydrology and stream water quality. This dissertation documents research conducted to quantify urban expansion, and to explore the complex relationships among terrestrial landscape features, urban stream hydrology, social system factors, and water quantity and quality variables in 20 urban stream watersheds located in five central Iowa cities. First, urban land cover change was quantified for four cities using planimetric data applied to aerial photo images from 1940 to 2011. Impervious surfaces accounted for about 1. 5 % of the area in four study cities in 1940, and increased to 16. 8 % in 2011, a 1, 020 % increase. Much of the expansion of impervious surface was contributed by buildings and parking lots. High, medium, and low percent <b>impervious</b> surface <b>zones</b> were dominated by parking lots, buildings, and roads, respectively. Second, both climate change and land cover change were predicted and simulations were performed using the Storm Water Management Model to determine their potential effects on stream hydrology (with unit-area peak discharge, flashiness index, and runoff ratio as response variables) in five selected study watersheds. Simulation of climate change predicted effects on unit-area peak discharge, while simulation of land cover change predicted changes in all three response variables. Different distributions of additional impervious surface simulated within a single watershed had a greater effect on timing of delivery than on total amount of discharge. Third, the direct, indirect and total effects of human system, terrestrial landscape features, and stream hydrology variables on water quality outcome variables were assessed using path analysis. Stream water conductivity, total nitrogen concentration, and total phosphorus concentration were strongly influenced by road density, percent of crop land, and percent of residents with college-level education, respectively. Finally, a semi-quantitative analysis of {{the implementation of the}} National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program was linked to water quality outcomes in 20 urban streams in five cities to examine the effectiveness of these regulatory requirements. Cities with higher ratings for completeness of responses to the NPDES stormwater program also had better stream water quality. Based on multiple regression analysis, a strong relationship was detected between the quality of municipal responses to the NPDES program and stream water concentrations of phosphate, total phosphorus, total suspended solids and turbidity. Evidence presented in this dissertation indicates that urban stream hydrology and water quality are related to characteristics of urban populations, landscapes, and that impacts of changes in these variables on urban stream water quality and quantity in central Iowa {{are likely to be more}} pronounced over time. The information provided by this research should be helpful for civic officials in these and other cities to mitigate against potential negative impacts of these changes to urban streams...|$|R
