50|$|The {{crash was}} the deadliest crash in China since the 2002's China Northern Airlines Flight 6136 crash in Dalian, which killed 112 people. Investigation by the CAAC (short for Civil Aviation Administration of China) {{revealed}} that the plane had not been de-iced by the ground crew while it was parked at the <b>airport.</b> <b>Ice</b> accumulation on the wings caused the plane to lost its lift, which caused it to crash.|$|R
50|$|Since 5 November 2007, {{the station}} has been {{integrated}} {{as part of}} the AIRail Service. In the station’s travel centre there were two Lufthansa check-in machines, which allowed passengers to check their luggage on Lufthansa flights. These have since been replaced by other check-in arrangements. Passengers travel by <b>ICE</b> to Frankfurt <b>Airport</b> long-distance station and then proceed to their aircraft. The baggage is carried to Frankfurt airport and taken to the aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|The Beechcraft King Air A100 {{airplane}} {{crashed into}} dense forest {{about two miles}} from the Eveleth airport, while operating under instrument flight rules. It had no flight data recorders. Autopsy toxicology results on both pilots were negative for drug or alcohol use. Icing, though widely reported on in following days, [...] was considered and eventually rejected as a significant factor in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) judged that while cloud cover might have prevented the flight crew from seeing the <b>airport,</b> <b>icing</b> did not affect the airplane's performance during the descent.|$|R
40|$|Snow and <b>ice</b> {{accumulation}} on <b>airport</b> runways force airports {{to cancel}} or significantly delay flights. Winter weather can also drastically affect airport safety {{during times of}} aircraft takeoff and landing. During these times, countless dollars are used to remove snow and return airports to their functional conditions. In this thesis, a conductive concrete solar energy system will be examined {{in order to prevent}} snow and ice accumulation. The objective of this research is to implement a conductive concrete overlay system on airport runways in conjunction with photovoltaic energy so that no frost precipitation accumulates on the runway surface...|$|R
40|$|Radiometrics Corporation, {{headquartered}} in Boulder, Colorado, engaged in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) agreements with Glenn Research Center {{that resulted in}} a pencil-beam radiometer designed to detect supercooled liquid along flight paths [...] a prime indicator of dangerous icing conditions. The company has brought to market a modular radiometer that resulted from the SBIR work. Radiometrics' radiometers are used around the world as key tools for detecting <b>icing</b> conditions near <b>airports</b> and for the prediction of weather conditions like fog and convective storms, which are known to produce hail, strong winds, flash floods, and tornadoes. They are also employed for oceanographic research and soil moisture studies...|$|R
50|$|The main {{campus of}} the {{university}} is {{on the edge of}} the 60.000 inhabitants counting town of Offenburg. The cities of Strasbourg (20 km), Baden-Baden (50 km), Freudenstadt (50 km), Freiburg (65 km) and Karlsruhe (70 km) can be reached easily and quickly by car or train. Offenburg is a hub of international transport routes. It is just off the A5 motorway and is served on the Rhine Valley Railway of the German railway company Deutsche Bahn with the high speed train <b>ICE.</b> The <b>Airport</b> of Karlsruhe Baden-Baden, offering pan-European flights, is only 45 km away. Due to its attractive location, also internationally known companies, such as Hubert Burda Media, Tesa, Vivil and Elcoteq settled in the city of Offenburg. There are leisure activities in plenty in Offenburg, for it is in the middle of the green and fertile region Ortenau with many hiking and biking trails through the meadows and vineyards. An exciting variation offers the Europa-Park (30 km), Europe's largest theme park, with its many attractions and roller coasters. The Offenburg housing market and 3 student residences offer a variety of housing options for every taste and budget. On the Campus of Offenburg are the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical and Process Engineering as well as Media and Information science.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost recent {{research}} and monitoring of under-water “soundscapes” {{has focused on}} marine systems in open water conditions. Here we present the first long-term assessment of the diel and seasonal patterns of a fresh-water aquatic soundscape under-ice cover. Acoustic data recorded in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories, measured the under-ice soundscape near an <b>ice</b> road and <b>airport.</b> From December to late January, the soundscape consisted of geophony from ice cracking and anthrophony from snowmobiles, aircraft, and road vehicles. In late January, burbot spawning calls began and added a localized biophony source to the soundscape that increased the total sound pressure level due {{to an increase in}} sound levels in the 10 – 425 Hz frequency band. The median 1 min root-mean-square sound pressure level (rms SPL) in the period without burbot biophony was 90. 3 dB re 1 μPa. The measured hourly rms SPL was negatively correlated with air temperature in the 200 – 800 Hz band but positively correlated with average hourly wind speed in the 800 – 8000 Hz band. The nightly mean rms SPL was 88 dB re 1 μPa and increased to 96 dB re 1 μPa in late afternoon. This diel cycle had a strong positive correlation with the number of minutes per hour where ice-road vehicles were detected. Further work is recommended to quantify the soundscape in deep-water areas of large lakes and to include particle motion. Such information will enable the assessment of cumulative impacts of anthrophony and geophony on aquatic biota...|$|R
