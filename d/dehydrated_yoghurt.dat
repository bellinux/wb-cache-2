40|$|Traditionally, yoghurt is {{produced}} in a hydrated form and, thus, possesses a limited shelf-life even when refrigerated. Consumption {{within a short time}} of production is advisable, particularly if advantage is to be taken of the putative benefits associated with the ingestion of live yoghurt cultures. The production of an instant yoghurt powder would, thus, provide benefits of shelf-life extension and convenience of preparation and storage. However, the drying of such products is difficult due to low pH, which causes stickiness in drier chambers and makes powder recovery difficult. Furthermore, key flavour components formed by fermentation such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl which contribute to the unique flavour of natural yoghurt are sensitive to heat and easily lost during spray-drying. Hence, a major challenge of this project was to investigate the processing technologies and conditions necessary for the minimisation of flavour losses during the spray-drying of acidified/fermented milk bases, to monitor the effects on drier performance such as powder adhesion to drier walls, and to develop functional forms of the spray-dried ingredients. The main aims of the project were to: - improve yoghurt powder spray-drying efficiency through optimisation of concentrate solids, - investigate the effect of spray-drying conditions on flavour losses of sensitive products such as <b>dehydrated</b> <b>yoghurt</b> and fermented creams,- apply technological approaches for the reduction of flavour losses: a) ingredient formulation, b) modification of fermentation conditions, - investigate the production of agglomerated forms of spray-dried yoghurt powders, - study factors affecting the physical properties such as rheological characteristics and powder bulk density, and - adapt technology to ensure greater viability of culture cell numbers {{at the end of the}} drying process.
