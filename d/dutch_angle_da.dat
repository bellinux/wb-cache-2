5000|$|A <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> is {{a camera}} shot {{in which the}} camera has been rotated {{relative}} to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> are static shots, but in a moving <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> shot the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.|$|R

50|$|Man with a Movie Camera {{is famous}} for the range of {{cinematic}} techniques Vertov invents, deploys or develops, such as double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts, split screens, <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played backwards, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> is an overt cinematographical {{technique}} {{that can be}} overused. The science-fiction film Battlefield Earth (2000), in particular, drew sharp criticism for its pervasive use of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle.</b> In the words of film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, {{but he has not}} learned why".|$|R
50|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> are {{frequently}} used by film directors {{who have a}} background in the visual arts, such as Tim Burton (in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood), and Terry Gilliam (in Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Tideland) to represent madness, disorientation, or drug psychosis. In his Evil Dead trilogy, Sam Raimi used <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> {{to show that a}} character had become possessed.|$|R
50|$|Dziga Vertov's 1929 {{experimental}} documentary Man with a Movie Camera contains {{uses of the}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> {{among other}} innovative techniques discovered by Vertov himself.|$|R
50|$|In cinematography, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> {{is one of}} many {{cinematic}} techniques {{often used}} to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth season}} premiere of Charmed uses <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> {{in a few}} scenes to {{emphasize}} the imbalance felt by the main characters after Prue Halliwell's death.|$|R
50|$|The 1960s series The Twilight Zone {{also has}} some episodes with <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles.</b> They were often used to show fear or {{disorientation}} expirienced by the character..|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 1960s Batman TV series and 1966 film, satires in which each villain had {{his or her own}} angle, as they were [...] "crooked".|$|R

50|$|Casale {{directed}} several television commercials, including ads for Diet Coke and Honda Scooters featuring Devo, {{as well as}} for Coco's restaurants, and Miller Lite. Distinctive {{elements of}} Casale's visual style include <b>dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> desaturated color, and color washes on images.|$|R
5000|$|Star Trek: The Original Series would on {{occasion}} feature <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> {{notably in the}} episode [...] "Wink of an Eye" [...] in which the angle was used in scenes taking place in accelerated time and the transition to acceleration represented with a rotation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> {{are often}} used in horror video games, {{particularly}} those with static camera angles such as early entries in the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises. Similar to their use in movies, these angles are used {{to bring about a}} feeling of unease in the player.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> {{also called}} a canted angle or even simply the tilted angle, is an angle {{in which the}} camera itself is tilted {{to the left or}} the right. The unnatural angle gives the viewer a feeling that world is out of balance or {{psychological}} unrest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> {{also known}} as <b>Dutch</b> tilt, canted <b>angle,</b> or oblique angle, {{is a type of}} camera shot where the camera is set at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is {{composed}} with vertical lines at an angle {{to the side of the}} frame, or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame. This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side.|$|R
50|$|The 1949 film The Third Man makes {{extensive}} use of <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> shots, to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. An anecdote of cinema lore alleges that once filming was completed, the crew presented director Carol Reed with a spirit level, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot almost entirely in <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> meaning the vast {{majority}} of shots are framed diagonally, or [...] "tilted". At the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, Hartley revealed that the two shots in the film's final cut that are not [...] "Dutched" [...] occurred when he and the film crew forgot to tilt the camera.|$|R
5000|$|Dutch {{refers to}} a bastardisation of the word [...] "Deutsch", the German word for [...] "German". It {{is not related to}} the Dutch people or language. It {{originated}} in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> extensively.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1930s Florey {{settled into}} the studio system and {{produced}} vehicles for Warren William, Guy Kibbee, and Akim Tamiroff (briefly promoted as a lead actor). For some film historians, Florey's finest work is in these modest low-budget programmers and B movies. Florey hit a peak at Paramount in the late 1930s with Hollywood Boulevard (1936), King of Gamblers (1937), and Dangerous to Know (1938), all marked by fast pace, cynical tone, <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> and dramatic lighting.|$|R
5000|$|The angle {{was widely}} used to depict madness, unrest, exoticism, and {{disorientation}} in German Expressionism, hence its name , meaning German, was often conflated with the etymologically similar word [...] {{which gives the}} corruption of the term now commonly used. Montages of <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> are structured {{in a way that the}} tilts are almost always horizontally opposite in each shot, for example, a right-tilted shot will nearly always be followed with a left-tilted shot, and so on.|$|R
50|$|Low-key {{lighting}} schemes mark most noirs. The series {{incorporates the}} use of long dark shadows {{in the tradition of}} chiaroscuro and tenebrism. Film noir is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's low shot introduction in the first episode. Noir cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like <b>dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.|$|R
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle</b> shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|R
5000|$|Dezaki {{was known}} for his {{distinct}} visual style, which makes use of split screen, stark lighting, extensive use of <b>dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> and pastel freeze frames that he called [...] "postcard memories", which may be his most famous trademark. They feature a process whereby the screen fades into a detailed [...] "painting" [...] of the simpler original animation. Many of his techniques became popular and came to be seen as special techniques of Japanese animation. He particularly influenced Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Yoshiyuki Tomino, Ryūtarō Nakamura, Noriyuki Abe, Kunihiko Ikuhara, Akiyuki Shinbo, and Yutaka Yamamoto.|$|R
500|$|Raimi {{developed}} {{a sense of}} mise en scène, coming up with ideas for scenes at a fast rate. He had drawn several crude illustrations to help him break down the flow of scenes. The crew was surprised when Raimi began using <b>dutch</b> <b>angles</b> during shots to build atmosphere during scenes. To accommodate Raimi's style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a camera dolly. One involved the [...] "vas-o-cam", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down long wooden platforms {{to create a more}} fluid sense of motion.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Chester {{directed}} an unreleased 16mm low-budget independent narrative {{feature film}} shot on Assateague Island near his boyhood home. Since then, he has produced, directed, and shot productions for Animal Planet, ESPN, the A&E Network and various nonprofit clients. Similar to documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, Chester has cast {{himself as a}} prominent character in several of his own projects, most notably the [...] "Touched by a Slacker" [...] documentary-style reality TV series Random 1, and its feature-length film sequel Lost in Woonsocket. His cinematography and directorial style often features <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> a highly saturated color palette, and/or low-key lighting.|$|R

5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film to look like a comic book.|$|R
50|$|When {{the comic}} began, figures were posed against props and backgrounds, with word {{balloons}} added after photos were taken. As the comic progressed, more advanced techniques {{were used to}} improve the quality of the comic. The figures are now shot against a white background, then superimposed with Bluescreen technology over a different background such as a sprawling cityscape. Special effects like <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> explosions, motion blurs, and Wild Takes have also been added to give a more cinematic and dramatic look. While many of the figures are articulated, McGuinness must use photoshop techniques in order to bring many of the characters to life, such as the figurines for Shin-Goji and the Toxic Pirates, which have no articulation at all.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the pilot}} {{season of the}} now-infamous series The Real World. Prior to filming the series in 1992, six strangers were chosen to live {{in exactly the same}} loft that The Real World: New York cast would live in over Memorial Day Weekend 1991. The series was filmed entirely with Hi-8 cameras, no {{lighting}} system in the house, and an entirely different cast than what was used for the first season. This program was shot in NY on lower Broadway over a long weekend.Rob Klug was the original director and worked many creative ideas into show- <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles</b> and shooting hand held in streets. At the time people did not believe that you could shoot a high quality TV show with a small handheld camera. Doc style and make it work.|$|R
5000|$|Visual {{influences}} include graphic novels, Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, {{and film}} noir such as Alphaville. Other influences cited by journalists include Face/Off, Sin City, and Guy Ritchie films, {{all of which}} it parodies. Spencer cited {{the level of violence}} in the series, describing it as [...] "the most violent comedy in television history". The Parents Television Council confirmed this by listing the series amongst its “seven most violent shows on cable” for that season where it bore the distinction of being the only half-hour comedy on the list. [...] With its filmic influences, Spencer thought it appropriate to include stylized action sequences and violence not usually associated with half-hour comedies. [...] The camerawork, such as use of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>angle,</b> was designed to be reminiscent of graphic novels as well as the Cinema of Europe.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by {{a tour of}} the Caucasus, {{the writer}} and {{journalist}} Sergei Tretyakov wrote a newspaper article that gave Kalatozov the idea for the film. Tretyakov then wrote a script for Kalatozov, and shooting began in the mountain village Ushguli in Upper Svanetia. Originally the film was planned to be a fictional feature film, but ultimately Viktor Shklovsky edited the footage Kalatozov had shot in Svanetia into a documentary film. Most, but not all, parts of the documentary were staged, similar to other Soviet documentaries of the early 1930s. The authencity of some scenes has been disputed by the Svan people who deny that some of the customs shown have ever existed. The cinematography of Mikhail Kalatozov and the cinematographer Shalva Gegelashvili has been described as expressionistic due to its use of dramatic shadows, silhouettes against a dramatic skyline and <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jacobs {{says the}} concept behind Super Show! was {{something}} he had always dreamed of doing, making a [...] "campy, live-action, funky kid's show" [...] in the vein of the 1960s and 1970s television {{that he and the}} rest of the series' producers had grown up with. While the show pays homage to many facets of pop culture, Jacobs has named the 1960s Batman television series as the primary influence on Super Show!s [...] "obviously silly" [...] tone and visual style, ranging from set design to the trademark use of <b>dutch</b> <b>angles</b> for villain scenes. Other notable influences Jacobs has repeatedly mentioned include the works of Sid and Marty Krofft and Hanna-Barbera, Japanese tokusatsu series such as Ultraman and Johnny Sokko And His Flying Robot, the Shaw Brothers and Hong Kong cinema, and shows including Danger Island, Star Trek, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse, noting [...] "there’s a good 30 years worth of television culture packed into these 22-minute episodes".|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opened to}} nearly {{universal}} negative reviews {{and was a}} large box office bomb. Due to bad word of mouth and Internet buzz, it quickly disappeared from theatre chains, having grossed $29,725,663 worldwide against a reported $73 million budget. Almost {{all aspects of the}} film were criticized: hammy acting (especially by Travolta and Pepper), the film's overuse of <b>Dutch</b> <b>angles,</b> mediocre visual effects, corny dialogue, and several plot inconsistencies. The film received seven Golden Raspberry Awards at the 21st such ceremony, including that for Worst Picture, and it later won two special awards: [...] "Worst Drama of Our Razzies' First 25 Years" [...] and [...] "Worst Picture of the Decade" [...] (2000‒2009), at the 25th and 30th Golden Raspberry Awards respectively. Only Jack and Jill, a 2011 comedy co-written, produced by, and starring Adam Sandler, has won more Raspberries (jointly or solely winning all ten of the awards presented at the 32nd Razzies).|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} compare the results {{obtained}} with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) and EMD + platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) {{in the treatment of}} intrabony defects (IBDs) in chronic periodontitis patients. Materials and Methods: Using a split-mouth design, 28 paired IBDs were randomly treated either with EMD or with EMD + PRF. Clinical and radiographic measurements including clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), defect depth (DD), defect width (DW) and defect <b>angle</b> (<b>DA)</b> were recorded at baseline (BL) and at six months following therapy. Results: BL clinical and radiographic measurements were similar for EMD and EMD + PRF groups. Although postsurgical measurements revealed significant reduction for PD and CAL in both groups, no intergroup difference was detected. When EMD and EMD + PRF groups were compared, defect fill was not also statistically different. Conclusions: Both therapies resulted in significant clinical improvement in IBD treatment. Addition of PRF did not improve the clinical and radiographic outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|During {{his career}} Dezaki created many {{animation}} techniques that became {{standard in the}} Japanese animation industry and are used throughout the special. One of his best known techniques [...] "Postcard memories", also commonly known as [...] "Harmony" [...] involved adding painted lines to a cel to {{give the appearance of}} a watercolor effect and provide visual impact with minimal animation. While this technique is normally used to end a scene, during the special it is also used during action scenes. Another signature technique used during the special is the [...] "triple take" [...] where a cel is moved quickly across the camera multiple times to produce a sense of speed. The name comes from its typical usage of 3 passes of the cel. Lighting techniques used techniques include backlit backgrounds, gel effects, lighting bloom in the corner of a scene and diagonal spotlights across heavily shadowed images to produce a sense of darkness. other techniques include Parallax scrolling to give depth to city scenes, split screens and <b>dutch</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R
