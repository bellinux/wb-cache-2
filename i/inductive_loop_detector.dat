40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is motivated}} by the practical problem of highway traffic estimation using velocity measurements from GPS enabled mobile devices such as cell phones. In order to simplify the estimation procedure, a velocity model for highway traffic is constructed, which results in a dynamical {{system in which the}} observation operator is linear. It presents a new scalar hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) model for traffic velocity evolution on highways, based on the seminal Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) PDE for density. Equivalence of the solution of the new velocity PDE and the solution of the LWR PDE is shown for quadratic flux functions. Because this equivalence does not hold for general flux functions, a discretized model of velocity evolution based on the Godunov scheme applied to the LWR PDE is proposed. Using an explicit instantiation of the weak boundary conditions of the PDE, the discrete velocity evolution model is generalized to a network, thus making the model applicable to arbitrary highway networks. The resulting velocity model is a nonlinear and nondifferentiable discrete time dynamical system with a linear observation operator, for which a Monte Carlo based ensemble Kalman filtering data assimilation algorithm is applied. The model and estimation technique is evaluated with experimental data obtained from a large-scale field experiment known as Mobile Century. The velocity estimates using GPS data from cellphones is compared to velocity estimates using <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> data from the PeMS system.

The analysis tools used in this study were transformed curves of cumulative vehicle count and cumulative timemean velocity. These cumulative curves provided the resolution necessary to reveal the spatial and temporal aspects of dynamic freeway traffic flow phenomena. With increasing availability of reliable freeway sensor data, it is important to continue the systematic empirical analysis of freeways in different countries with varying geometric configurations.

40|$|Despite {{the flow}} {{fluctuations}} and increased traffic {{demand in the}} Macedonian cities over the last fifteen years, the Republic of Macedonia {{is one of those}} countries which still employ only the traditional systems of traffic management and control. Those are fixed control systems that certainly cause problems such as increased travel times and travel expenses as well as environmental degradation. A general call for “…something has to be done…” becomes obvious. The best practices have shown that this can be realized through unconventional solutions i. e. by means of responsive traffic management. A very reasonable example of such a system is the vehicle actuated control system that we have found to be quite challenging to do our research. Thus, we set up two folded research issues in front of us. The first one was to scientifically prove that vehicle actuated signal control can really be a reasonable substitute for a fixed time signal control, which will enhance the overall signalized intersection performance provided the timing parameters and the detector placement ŕrĺ properly designed. The second one was to indicate that such an advanced control system is feasible and sustainable for Macedonian cities. This paper focuses on the first research issue only. For this purpose, a semi-actuated signal control strategy on an appropriately chosen signalized intersection was designed. The primary objective was to determine {{the way in which the}} <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> placement from the STOP line affects the overall intersection performance. To meet the goal, two scenarios were designed: 1. Detector placement at the STOP line, and 2. Detector placement at 8 metres behind the STOP line. Emphasis was placed on the semi-actuated signal control algorithm design. The designed algorithm was then applied in the net of VISSIM in order to simulate the semi-actuated signal control process. Performance comparison analysis with the formerly pre-timed signal control strategy followed. It was concluded that the overall intersection performance could be improved both by adequate <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> placement and by interaction with signal parameters. Hence, the placement distances would have to be considered under the limitation conditions only.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in vehicle-based surveillance technologies using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) promise high accuracy traffic information; however, their performance in field is insufficient yet mostly {{due to the}} lack of the number of probe vehicles.

The proposed algorithm is evaluated under both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion using a microscopic simulation model, PARAMICS. The evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves section travel time estimates compared to the cases when a single data source was used.

40|$|Actuated {{traffic signal}} {{controllers}} typically depend on inductive loop detectors to determine {{demand for a}} particular signal phase. The basic philosophy of these controllers is to only provide a green indication to a particular lane group {{when there is a}} vehicle waiting. If an <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detector</b> fails, it must be put in recall mode so that the lane group with the corresponding failed detector is serviced every cycle. When actuated controllers operate in this mode, the performance of the signalized intersection degenerates. Since the vast majority of actuated intersections operate with inductive loop detectors it is useful to have maintenance procedures {{that can be used to}} replace loop detectors that have failed due to pavement distress. This paper describes a procedure that has been developed using directional boring equipment to install a micro loop below the surface of the pavement where it is not subject to pavement distress.

When the first edition of the German Highway Capacity Manual (HBS) was prepared in 2001, the Federal Government decided that this 30 th hour should be used {{as the basis for the}} level of service determination for all Federal freeways and trunk roads. While German freeways are quite well equipped with <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detectors,</b> there are much fewer counts on rural roads and almost no long-term data on urban roads. With the current redraft of the German HBS detailed advice will be given on how to estimate peak-hour demand (all vehicles and heavy vehicle portion), based on the n-th highest hour concept depending on the available traffic counts. As the HBS will be divided into three major parts: freeways, rural roads, and urban roads, three separate chapters for the peak-hour demand estimation will be provided. Whereas for freeways the task consists in finding the comparable site equipped with <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detectors,</b> for urban roads it is a matter of establishing which time periods of the year and weekdays are appropriate for manual short-term counts as estimation of the 30 th hour of the year.

40|$|The use of non-intrusive video-detection {{for traffic}} flow {{observation}} and surveillance {{is the primary}} alternative to conventional <b>inductive</b> <b>loop</b> <b>detector.</b> A Video Image Detection System (VIDS) can derive traffic parameters by means of image processing and pattern recognition methods.

Existing VIDS emulates the inductive loop by virtual loops and derives the traffic parameters in a similar way. Additional benefits of the VIDS, e. g. large area observation of traffic flow or detection of special behaviors of single vehicles can not be exploiting in this way. To expand the common approach also for new types of information (queue length or erratic movements), we use a trajectory based recognition algorithm, which {{is related to the}} detection and tracking of individual vehicles in an image sequence.

A direct comparison between the video based and the classic inductive loop measurement of the traffic parameters is also possible. ...|$|E
