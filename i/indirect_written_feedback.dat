40|$|<b>Written</b> {{corrective}} <b>feedback</b> {{has proven}} to be a key tool to improve students writing. Many previous researchers have proven so. Teacher gets to decide their very own <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback.</b> There are many types of <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> that can be used in the classroom. They are direct <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback,</b> <b>indirect,</b> and metalinguistic. The paper presents the effect of using <b>indirect</b> <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> to improve students’ writing accuracy. The paper is intended to find the best <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> strategy in the classroom. The study is conducted to 35 low-proficiency ESL students. The writing pretest and posttest are used to measure students’ writing accuracy. The researcher uses a t-test to analyze the data. The result is satisfying. 35 students have shown statistically significant progress in their writing accuracy. The posttest result has outscored the pretest score. Furthermore, it is also shown that <b>indirect</b> <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> also elicits students’ autonomous learning.

40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>feedback</b> is a {{commonly}} applied {{method by which}} lecturers provide comments to students when {{a piece of work}} is assessed. The aim {{of this study was to}} capture the espoused views and practice of lecturers when providing <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> to ascertain the relationship between views and practice. Using a qualitative methodology, this study explored the views and practices of lecturers who provide <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> to postgraduate students on assessments. Eleven lecturers teaching postgraduate students within a social sciences faculty in a New Zealand tertiary institution participated in this study. Individual interviews were conducted to gain insight into lecturers’ espoused views on <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> and documentary analysis was carried out to explore <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> practice. One aspect that emerged from the study was the opportunity for lecturers to have a ‘voice’ and engage in discussion about <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> This has led to a recommendation for more dialogue around <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> practice. Key findings from the research study showed that lecturers believed: •	that the main role of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> was to improve students’ work; •	that attributing grades and providing feedback play a fundamental role in written feedback; and •	that their own individual style influences the <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> they provide. It was also found that: •	in certain aspects of <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> there are clear areas of alignment between what lecturers value and how they actually practice. Recommendations from this study stem from the researcher’s belief, that a deeper understanding of what lecturers think about their <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> is needed. In addition, the continued use of professional development opportunities to discuss <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> amongst colleagues is warranted. New lecturers should have an induction and mentoring programme that has a specific emphasis on <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> so that <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> is not lost in the broader topic of assessment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{call for}} {{longitudinal}} {{evidence on the}} efficacy of <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> (WCF) for ESL and EFL writers has been made repeatedly since Truscott (1996) claimed that it is ineffective, harmful, and therefore; should be abandoned. Though controversy continues as to whether error feedback helps L 2 student writers to improve the accuracy and overall quality of their writing (Ferris, 1999; Truscott, 1996; Truscott, 1999), most studies on error correction in L 2 writing classes have provided evidence that students who receive error feedback from teachers improve in accuracy over time. This study {{was an attempt to}} investigate the role of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> in improving EFL students’ writing skill. The participants were sixty pre-intermediate students in “Iranians” institute in Ardabil. Twenty students were in direct-feedback group, twenty students were in indirect-feedback group and twenty students were in no-feedback group. The variance of the number of errors of three classes in session one (pretest, appendix 1) was approximately equal, so their ability in this structure was the same. We gave the students TOEFL tests about definite and indefinite articles in five sessions. There were twenty-two tests and forty blanks in each session. The tests were selected from three books titled: TOEFL Grammar Flash, Rahnama TOEFL, and Longman Preparation Course for the TOEFL Test. Treatments were made on experimental groups through giving feedback and correcting their errors. This was fulfilled during five sessions (one session per week.). Two direct-feedback and indirect-feedback groups received the treatment in terms of giving feedback about their errors while the no-feedback group did not receive any kind of feedback. In correcting the papers of direct-feedback group, we gave them direct feedback on their errors. But in correcting the papers of indirect-feedback group we just underlined the errors. And in correcting no-feedback group we corrected their errors but we did not give them their papers. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data for three groups. Group differences were considered significant when ρ <. 05. The analysis of data is presented in this paper. Because the time interval of tests was the same and the type of testing (fill in the blanks test) also was the same and variances were equal so we analyzed just two phases of pretest (session 1) and posttest (session 5) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} social science doctoral students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and attitudes toward different characteristics of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> providers for their academic writing. Moreover, it aimed to provide an explanatory model to describe the relationships between these perceptions and attitudes, students 2 ̆ 7 revision decisions, and other potentially relevant factors in their <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> practices. The investigation was informed by two theoretical frameworks: principles of instructional design and conditions of learning, and situated learning and communities of practice. The study used a mixed methods approach in which qualitative data collection and analysis was followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. The main purpose of the qualitative phase was to develop a background to build a questionnaire to be used in the quantitative phase. The qualitative data were collected through interviews with 15 participants. Grounded theory data analysis methods were adapted in the qualitative analysis of the data. The quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire with 276 participants in two large mountain west public universities. Descriptive and multivariate correlational data analyses were employed for the analysis of the quantitative data. The results of this study provided descriptive information on doctoral students 2 ̆ 7 preferences for different types of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and their perceptions and attitudes toward different characteristics of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> providers. Moreover, the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results showed that that there are several factors in the feedback practices of the doctoral students that have significant influences on some other factors in these feedback practices.

Despite the high priority placed on <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> to date, insufficient research studies have been conducted on the student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this descriptive study is to describe student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessments at a university in the Western Cape. The objective of this study is to determine student nurses’ perceptions of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on assessment. Methodology: A quantitative descriptive survey research design was employed to conduct this study at a university in the Western Cape. The target population for this study was 106 student nurses registered in the nursing foundation programme for the year 2015. This study employed all-inclusive sampling of foundation student nurses registered in the year 2015. A questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. A total of 74 participants were available for the study, of whom, 69 submitted their questionnaires, resulting to a response rate of 93. 2 %. The data was analyzed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 and was presented in frequency tables, percentages and bar graphs. Ethics approval was obtained from the Senate Higher Degree and the Senate Research Committees of the institution under study, before commencing. Permission was also obtained from the Dean of Research and Head of the School of Nursing, before the commencement of the study. The purpose of the study was explained, and a consent form was signed, before the questionnaires were administered to participants. Findings: The findings of this study indicated that students receive feedback on assessment, were in line with the assessment criteria.

This study aims to compare the nursing students' satisfaction and reactions to oral versus <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> during clinical education.  Methods: This is a single blinde, randomized controlled trial. A purposive sample of last semester-nursing students (n= 44) was selected and randomly assigned into one of verbal or <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> groups. Each instructor (n= 3) was scheduled to teach two groups, and deliver either verbal or <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> Instructors were well attuned to feedback delivery sessions they would hold during their instructional tasks. Instructors were asked to give necessary feedback to the students and document the details of their reaction using the checklists designed for this purpose during the instruction period, daily and during the nine days of instruction. At the end of each instruction period, a questionnaire designed to measure the satisfaction level of feedback delivery sessions was filled out by students.  Results: The study did not show difference of satisfaction level between the oral and <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> groups. The relationship between students' reactions and feedback type at the confidence level of 90 % was significant, so that students who received oral feedback showed more severe reactions as compared to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> group.  Conclusion: Students, satisfaction level in both groups was the same.

40|$|Many {{evaluation}} instruments {{have been}} developed to provide feedback to physicians on their clinical teaching but <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> alone is not always effective. We explored whether feedback effectiveness improved when teachers’ self-assessment was added to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> based on student ratings. 37 physicians (10 residents, 27 attending physicians) from different specialties (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Neurology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, ENT, and Psychiatry) were invited to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire on their teaching skills. Students completed an almost identical questionnaire to evaluate the same teachers based on their experiences during clerkships. After receiving <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> incorporating their self-assessment and the student ratings, the teachers indicated their perceptions of the self-assessment exercise and the <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in a questionnaire (five-point Likert scale items) and next, in more detail, in semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 of the participating teachers. 25 physicians participated (67 %). The results showed that self-assessment and student feedback were both perceived as useful (3. 7, SD 1. 0) but the latter was considered more effective. The physicians we interviewed considered the combination of self-assessment with student ratings more effective than either self-assessment or <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> alone. Notably, discrepancies between student ratings and self-assessment were deemed a strong incentive for change. We conclude that self-assessment can be a useful tool to stimulate improvement of clinical teaching when it is combined with <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> based on student ratings. Future research among larger groups is needed to confirm our findings and examine whether these combined tools actually lead to improved teaching...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in English {{teaching}} in an upper secondary school. The research is a comparative study of the teachers’ and the students’ experiences working with <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> The intention of the research is to study the teachers’ usage of <b>feedback</b> on <b>written</b> work in their English teaching and how {{the students and the}} teachers experience the feedback in relation to the students’ development in the English language. The study is based on national and international research regarding the usage of feedback in teaching. The method for the study is qualitative and involves interviews of four teachers and four students. The results of the study reveal that <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> is individually adapted and used when assignments are finished. Students who are interested and motivated to learn English are provided with more <b>feedback.</b> <b>Written</b> <b>feedback</b> is combined with oral feedback to make sure the feedback is understood. The <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> is often provided combined with a grade. Students are of the opinion that feedback develops their skills in English while teachers claim that they do not detect the connection between <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and student improvement. In conclusion students do not get the opportunity to improve their skills due to the absence of process writing which means that students are responsible for whether or not the feedback is acted on. Students who are good in English improve their English more since the teachers provide them with more feedback than the weaker students. The combination of feedback and grades results in the students not paying attention to the feedback...|$|R

The study was conducted in an English as a Foreign Language context in which the participating students received <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on their English writings. Employing qualitative interviews and stimulated recall methodology, we explored interstudent interactions, cross-cultural understanding, and initiation into communities of practice, and categorized these as reactive and deliberative types of nonformal learning. Drawing upon Eraut's typology of nonformal learning, we would argue that formative <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> provided on students' writings could lead to nonformal learning because it encourages them to act upon it...|$|R
30|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} how <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> can be theorized as a {{mediation}} tool based on Vygotsky’s ([1978]) notions of scaffolding and ZPD. There is abundance of literature regarding the role of corrective feedback in relation to second language development. The research studies that explore the effectiveness of corrective feedback focus {{on the idea that}} error correction leads to language development. Although most of the research studies conducted in this field highlight the role of corrective feedback in second language development, they consider <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> as a corrective tool within the authority of the teacher. However, it is also possible to consider <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> as a mediation tool between the teacher and students. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize research conducted in the field of academic literacy and argues for more effective <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> options with examples from an English as a second language (ESL) context. In order to do this, the paper discusses the theorization of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> by four different areas of interest, namely, Second Language Acquisition (SLA), Second Language Writing (L 2 W), Sociocultural Theory (SCT) and systemic functional linguistics (SFL) based genre pedagogy of the Sydney School. The discussion of the SLA, L 2 W, and SCT approaches will be followed by an elaboration on why the Sydney School is productive for understanding second language acquisition and second language writing. SCT and the Sydney School see feedback as a supportive dialogic process between the teacher and the learner. On the other hand, SLA and L 2 W perspectives regard feedback as a means to correct student errors. The approach presented in this paper helps L 2 writing instructors consider <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> as a corrective and supportive tool that assists to mediate learning. Following the exploration of feedback from these four perspectives, the paper will present a newer theorization of feedback and students’ response to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> followed by examples.|$|R
40|$|The NCETM {{identified}} three areas which were deemed of particular significance {{in providing a}} mastery curriculum- developing deep knowledge, consolidating particular skills and ensuring rapid interventions take place {{in order to address}} misconceptions in a timely manner. The focus of this dissertation was to research the capacity a form of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> (mastery marking) had in providing one of these three areas depending on the child's progress towards achieving a lesson's learning objective. A range of qualitative methods were used to gather relevant data. The data collected from focus groups, whole class discussions and examinations of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> was then analysed. This led to particular themes being identified. These included the changing perceptions of children regarding feedback, task type, frequency and delivery and barriers for teachers to contest against when trying to provide 'mastery marking'. Findings suggest that mastery marking did provide children with more opportunities to demonstrate deep knowledge depending on the group they were in. An increased amount of time for children to respond to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> was also a result of the intervention. It also brought about <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> which was more specifically tailored to the individual needs of the children. Particular constraints for the teachers had an impact on their uptake and implementation of the intervention. The implications for this study appear to be that teachers can provide increasingly effective <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> but particular constraints can curtail their ability to do this as regularly and as accurately as they would like. In order to enhance the quality and regularity of <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> {{there appears to be a}} need to mitigate these barriers where possible. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} discuss the {{findings}} from a qualitative analysis of 136 pieces of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> on summative student assessments. The assessment and feedback mechanisms vary in format, and the sample covered all three levels of an undergraduate programme (four courses) in one case department. This article will evidence linguistic variations in <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> which signify an unequal discursive relationship between the marker and student. This variation is likely to contribute to issues in feedback clarity and consistency. Tensions amid the language used reflect academic gatekeeping, and the interpersonal aspect of feedback, will be discussed with reference to notions of 'linguistic capital'. Assisting students {{in the interpretation of}} <b>written</b> <b>feedback,</b> and encouraging alternative forms of feedback to enhance staff-student dialogue will be suggested as recommendations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Educational {{feedback}} is amongst {{the most powerful}} of all learning interventions. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) Can we measure the quality of <b>written</b> educational <b>feedback</b> with acceptable metrics? (2) Based on such a measure, does a quality improvement (QI) intervention improve the quality of feedback? STUDY DESIGN: We developed a QI instrument to measure the quality of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and applied it to <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> provided to medical students following workplace assessments. We evaluated the measurement characteristics of the QI score using generalisability theory. In an uncontrolled intervention, QI profiles were fed back to GP tutors and pre and post intervention scores compared. STUDY RESULTS: A single assessor scoring 6 feedback summaries can discriminate between practices with a reliability of 0. 82. The quality of feedback rose for two years after the introduction of the QI instrument and stabilised in the third year. The estimated annual cost to provide this {{feedback is}} £ 12 per practice. Interpretation and recommendations: It is relatively straightforward and inexpensive to measure the quality of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> with good reliability. The QI process appears {{to improve the quality of}} <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> We recommend routine use of a QI process to improve the quality of educational feedback...|$|R

40|$|As {{with many}} other HEI's within the United Kingdom, {{external}} examiners continue to praise the feedback that is given to students and yet this is not reflected in national student experience surveys. Indeed according to Price et al (2011), students have become progressively disengaged with feedback due to perpetual and repeated unsatisfactory feedback experiences as they progress through their university courses. Additionally, other data suggests that students do not identify with assessment criteria and feedback {{due to a lack}} of understanding of their meaning and academic expectations (Higgins et al 2001). The primary aim of the ‘written feedback’ project is to enhance and transform feedback practices of academics' through the use of computer simulations that capture and reflect students’ interpretations and reactions to <b>written</b> assessment <b>feedback.</b> The majority of learning resources for academics are developed by academics whereas this project has active student engagement throughout to ensure that the staff development resource is co-created by academics and students. The primary aim of this innovative project is to enhance the quality of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> given by academics, through highlighting how <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> can be interpreted in many different ways. This will be done through computer simulations using avatars to capture and reflect student interpretations and reactions to <b>written</b> assessment <b>feedback.</b> The secondary aims of the project are to: •	Create an online resource that can be used to explore and explain the terminology often used in <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in an attempt to move academics away from using terms that are not easily understood •	Use the created resource for student assessment workshops and road shows to help bridge the different perceptions and understanding of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> •	Highlight the emotional impact that giving and receiving <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> has on both the student and the academic...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> on EFL learners’ performance after completing a set of output activities. The study involved two groups of learners (24 male students) at intermediate level. The first group, consisting of six pairs, worked on four output activities (text editing, composition, transformation and substitution). The second group received <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> after completing the same activities. Twelve tailor-made dyad-specific tests were constructed and administered to the pairs of learners. Results revealed that the participants who received <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> after completing the activities outperformed those who did not receive <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> The study confirms the view that providing an opportunity for interaction after receiving feedback triggers noticing the gaps between the learners' interlanguage and target language, which facilitates L 2 development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background. Previous {{research}} on <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> {{has taken place}} mainly in campus-based settings. <b>Written</b> <b>feedback</b> to Non-Native English speaking Online Doctoral students is under-researched. Aim. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the attitudes, perceptions and actions of Non-Native English Speaking (NNES) Online Doctoral students toward the <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> that they receive from their Native English Speaking (NES) doctoral research supervisors. This research will address questions about these students’ attitudes and perceptions regarding <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and the feedback providers. Furthermore, the investigation’s research findings point towards practical application by doctoral research supervisors. The Social Presence, Transactional Distance and Second Language Activity theories frame the interpretation of the findings. Sample. 100 online doctoral students completed the online survey of which 41 completed enough of the survey to be included in the study and 10 telephonic or Skype interviews were conducted. The survey respondents lived on different continents and represented seventeen distinct first languages, namely Afrikaans; Arabic; Chinese; Croatian; Dutch; French; German; Italian; Malay; Malayalam; Mandarin; Portuguese; Romanian; Russian; Spanish; Swedish; and Turkish. Method. A survey preceded and informed the 10 individual semi-structured interviews. An exploratory sequential, mixed methodological approach was used to develop an understanding of the main themes related to what NNES online doctoral students do with <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> Findings. This study focuses on the intersection of the online modality with the language issues encountered by NNES online doctoral students as opposed to campus-based NNES doctoral students or NES online doctoral students. The focus of this study is not a comparison between campus-based and online NNES and NES students but is intended to reflect upon issues that will promote the use of <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> to improve the NNES online doctoral students learning experience. This study found that while NNES online doctoral students share many of the experiences of NNES campus-based students and NES online doctoral students, the combination of online and language issues compound the NNES online doctoral students’ ability to make good use of the <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> that they receive. This combination of online and NNES has significant implications for policy, institutional guidance and practice.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the impact of the {{different}} types of feedback on students’ academic performance. This paper explores students’ preference in the use of audio and <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> and how each type of feedback received by students impact on their academic performance in subsequent assignments. The study involved 68 students who were divided into two groups that received either audio or <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in their first assignment which was then recalled and applied into the second assignment. An analysis of results obtained in the second assignment was conducted and comparisons made between students in the audio and <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> group. Students were also surveyed using an online questionnaire to ascertain their perceptions about the type of feedback they had received. The study established that the type of feedback received did not impact on students’ grades in the subsequent assignment. In addition, while students were broadly positive about audio feedback, they indicated a strong preference for <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> in future assignments. The study recommends, among other things, further investigation into the link between students’ learning styles and their preferences for different types of feedback...|$|R

The paper then focuses on two student writers who show contrasting patterns of feedback use and who also both become much less positive about their writing during the course. The student revisions after receiving teacher <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> are analyzed and contextual data is used to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} students' motivations and responses to the feedback. The data show that use of teacher <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> varies due to individual differences in needs and student approaches to writing. It also appears to be affected by the different experiences students bring with them to the classroom setting. Some implications for teachers giving feedback are also given. It is suggested that there needs to be a more open teacher/student dialogue on feedback, since the data suggest that the feedback situation has great potential for miscommunication and misunderstanding. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
