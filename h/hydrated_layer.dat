40|$|Lake Baikal in Siberia, {{one of the}} world’s largest rift lakes, {{is known}} to be the only fresh-water lake with gas {{hydrates}} in the subsurface. Seismic data clearly image the base of the <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer</b> in the Central and Southern Baikal Basins, at both sides of the Selenga delta. Gas seeps and short-lived mud volcanoes were discovered in Lake Baikal’s South Basin at places where the gas <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer</b> shows anomalous thickness variations, which was attributed to localized heat flow anomalies along active fault segments. The gas seeps were interpreted as the result of localized destabilization of gas hydrates by injected thermal water along fault segments; it is probably the inevitable consequence of gas hydrate accumulation in an active rift basin. New data from Lake Baikal’s Central basin, acquired during the summer of 2002, show that the four seeps in the South Basin are not isolated cases. More seeps were discovered, all situated in Baikal’s hydrate accumulation area, all near active fault segments, and all associated with anomalous thickness variations of the underlying <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer.</b> This poster gives an overview of the occurrence of gas seeps in Lake Baikal in relation with thickness anomalies of the gas <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer.</b> The gas seeps in Lake Baikal were found in three areas: 1. Posolsky fault area. Four methane seeps were encountered in the footwall of a small antithetic fault of the Posolsky fault zone. The seeps occur as blow-out craters and conical mud volcanoes. 2. Olkhon fault splay area. Two gas seeps, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk, were discovered in 2002 at the footwall of a splay of the large Olkhon border fault. The seeps appear to be conical mud volcanoes. 3. The Kukuyu canyon area. The Kukuyu canyon is a large, probably fault-related, canyon, at the northern slope of the Selenga delta. Gas seeps are documented on side scan sonar data and subbottom acoustic profiles. The newly discovered seeps support the interpretation that gas seeps and mud volcanoes in Lake Baikal are caused by the localized dissociation of gas hydrates by thermal input {{at the base of the}} <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer.</b> Seepage is probably intense but short-lived, and sometimes accompanied by mud extrusion at the lake floor.

40|$|A <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer</b> is {{an ideal}} {{capillary}} seal, beneath which free gas is trapped. Gas overpressure increases as gas accumulates and gas column grows. Capillary I seals have the property that they fall completely when gas pressure reaches {{the point that they}} are invaded by gas, and thereafter they offer little resistance to gas venting. After the seepage is triggered, the venting gas will push the overlying water upward at increasingly higher velocities as the gas "piston" approaches the seafloor. Numerical model shows that as the water velocity increases the near surface sediments will become quick at a depth that the resistance of water flow exceeds the hydrostatic pressure of the sediment hosting the water flow. These quick sediments can then be removed by bottom ocean currents, leaving a hollow pockmark on the seafloor. Thereafter, a free gas pathway is formed below the pockmarks and the reservoir gas drains quickly. The pockmark depth is a function of thickness of free gas column beneath the hydrate and depth of the hydrate seal (bottom of <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer).</b> Interestingly, pockmark depth does not depend on sediment permeability.

One of the most interesting characteristics of biomimetic apatite nanocrystals is the existence of a surface <b>hydrated</b> <b>layer</b> essentially related to their formation process in solution. This <b>hydrated</b> <b>layer</b> shows specific spectroscopic characteristics. It seems to exist in its nascent state only in wet samples and is altered on drying. This surface-hydrated layer progressively disappears as the stable apatite domains develop. The surface ions can be rapidly and reversibly exchanged in solution, mainly with selected bivalent species. The exchange reactions clearly reveal the existence of two domains: the relatively inert apatite core and the very reactive surface-hydrated domains. The structure of the <b>hydrated</b> <b>layer</b> has been shown to be reversibly affected by the constituting ions. Such a surface layer in bone apatite nanocrystals could participate actively in homeostasis and probably other regulation processes. The specificity of biomimetic apatite nanocrystals also opens interesting possibilities in materials science. The mobility of the mineral ions on the crystal surface, for example, allows strong bonding and interactions either with other crystals or with different substrates. Inter-crystalline interactions have been described as a “crystal fusion” process in vivo and they could be involved in the setting reaction of biomimetic calcium phosphate cements. Ceramic-like materials using the surface interaction capabilities of the nanocrystals can be produced at very low temperature (below 200 C). The surface-hydrated layer could also be involved in interactions with macromolecules and polymeric materials or in the coating of implants.

Therefore experimental approaches have to measure the properties of adsorbed protein layers with high accuracy in order to achieve a comprehensive description of the process. To this end, we used a combination of two biosensing techniques, dual polarization interferometry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. From this, we are able to extract surface coverage values, layer structural parameters, water content and viscoelastic properties to examine the properties of protein layers formed at the liquid/solid interface. Layer parameters were examined upon adsorption of proteins of varying size and structural properties, on surfaces with opposite polarity. We show that “soft” proteins such as unfolded α-synuclein and high molecular weight albumin are highly influenced by the surface polarity, as they form a highly diffuse and <b>hydrated</b> <b>layer</b> on the hydrophilic silica surface as opposed to the denser, less <b>hydrated</b> <b>layer</b> formed on a hydrophobic methylated surface.

In 1972, however, it was announced that gas <b>hydrate</b> <b>layers</b> were actually contributing to natural gas production in th...|$|R
40|$|Work {{during this}} period has focused on two areas: (1) Extension of our grain-scale model of hydrate {{formation}} to account for fragile hydrate films at the gas-water interface (2) Development of one-dimensional geologic bed-scale models of the conversion of methane to hydrate. During this reporting period, we presented two papers at the SPE ATCE, one presentation and two posters at AGU, and {{an article in the}} Fire in the Ice Newsletter 1. Our progress on the grain-scale model has allowed us to incorporate the potential instability of <b>hydrate</b> <b>layers</b> that form and grow at the gas-water interface. Such instabilities lead to rupture of the hydrate film, and subsequent imbibition events. The consequence of hydrate film rupture is that it accelerates the process of conversion to hydrate, since it removes the slow kinetic mass transfer across the <b>hydrate</b> <b>layer</b> (which thickens and becomes less porous with time). In current work, in collaboration with I-Ming Chou at USGS-Reston, we are trying to determine whether our model of film rupture is supported by experiments...|$|R
