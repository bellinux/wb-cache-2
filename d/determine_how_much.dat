5|$|Kleinman {{contacted}} {{a pair of}} Canadian graphic novel {{artists to}} begin the storyboarding process. Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the Â£1.3M budget to allocate to each section, and provided them with visuals to use {{as part of the}} presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E

5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, {{in order to minimize}} cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E

25|$|On November 27, 2007, United States Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross {{lifted the}} {{automatic}} stay {{so as to}} allow the Utah court to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money SCO owed Novell, but the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over any constructive trust that the Federal court might create.|$|E
25|$|For the {{purposes}} of the trial to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money SCO owed Novell, SCO was named the defendant and Novell was named the plaintiff, because SCO had not prevailed on any of its initial claims. The trial commenced April 30, 2008. Novell sought the recovery of $19,979,561 from SCO based on its licenses to Microsoft, Sun, and others.|$|E

25|$|An {{energy balance}} {{can be used}} to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for {{determining}} resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of thermodynamics, to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues. The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within the system.|$|E
25|$|Business pricing {{requires}} the company utilizing weather derivative instruments {{to understand how}} its financial performance is affected by adverse weather conditions {{across a variety of}} outcomes (i.e. obtain a utility curve with respect to particular weather variables). Then the user can <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he/she is willing to pay in order to protect his/her business from those conditions in case they occurred based on his/her cost-benefit analysis and appetite for risk. In this way, a business can obtain a 'guaranteed weather' for the period in question, largely reducing the expenses/revenue variations due to weather.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the design}} of the weapon and the {{environment}} in which it is detonated the energy distributed to these categories can be increased or decreased. The blast effect is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. Locations such as submarine, ground burst, air burst, or exo-atmospheric <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> energy is produced as blast and how much as radiation. In general, denser media around the bomb, like water, absorb more energy, and create more powerful shockwaves {{while at the same time}} limiting the area of its effect.|$|E

In newer versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Live USB creator {{can be used to}} install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or without a live CD or DVD). Creating a bootable USB drive with persistence is as simple as dragging a slider to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> space to reserve for persistence; for this, Ubuntu employs casper.|$|E
25|$|This process, {{also known}} as the {{measured}} drop, was introduced to Britain in 1872 by William Marwood as a scientific advance on the standard drop. Instead of everyone falling the same standard distance, the person's height and weight were used to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> slack would be provided in the rope so that the distance dropped would be enough to ensure that the neck was broken, but not so much that the person was decapitated. The careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
