In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> frame wall panels with cavity insulation and the new light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> frame composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions.

This article presents {{the details of the}} developed finite-element models of small-scale non-load-bearing light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> frame wall panels and the results of the thermal analysis. It has been shown that accurate finite-element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of small-scale light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> frame walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards.

40|$|In recent times, light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> {{sections}} {{have been}} used extensively in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural components. This is because cold-formed steel sections {{have a very high}} strength to weight ratio compared with thicker hot-rolled steel sections, and their manufacturing process is simple and cost-effective. However, these members are susceptible to various buckling modes including local and distortional buckling and their ultimate strength behaviour is governed by these buckling modes. Fire safety design of building structures has received greater attention in recent times due to continuing loss of properties and lives during fires. Hence, {{there is a need to}} fully evaluate the performance of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> structures under fire conditions. Past fire research has focused heavily on heavier, hot-rolled steel members. The buckling behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> members under fire conditions is not well understood. The buckling effects associated with thin steels are significant and have to be taken into account in fire safety design. Therefore, a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> compression members under simulated fire conditions. As the first phase of this research program more than 115 tensile coupon tests of light <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steels</b> including two steel grades and five thicknesses were conducted at elevated temperatures. Accurate mechanical properties including the yield strength, elasticity modulus and stress-strain curves were all determined at elevated temperatures since the deterioration of the mechanical properties is one of the major parameters in the structural design under fire conditions. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic characteristics. The results obtained from the tensile coupon tests were then used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members. In the second phase of this research more than 170 laboratory experiments were undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light <b>gauge</b> coldformed <b>steel</b> compression members at ambient and elevated temperatures. Two types of cross sections were selected with various thicknesses (nominal thicknesses are 0. 6, 0. 8, and 0. 95 mm) and both low and high strength steels (G 250 and G 550 steels with minimum yield strengths of 250 and 550 MPa). The experiments were conducted at six different temperatures in the range of 20 to 800 °C. A finite element model of the tested compression members was then developed and validated with the help of experimental results. The degradation of mechanical properties with increasing temperatures was included in finite element analyses. An extensive series of parametric analyses was undertaken using the validated finite element model to investigate the effect of all the influential parameters such as section geometry, steel thickness and grade, mechanical properties and temperature. The resulting large data base of ultimate loads of compression members subject to distortional buckling was then used to review the adequacy of the current design rules at ambient temperature. The current design rules were reasonably accurate in general, but in order to improve the accuracy further, this research has developed new design equations to determine the ultimate loads of compression members at ambient temperature. The developed equation was then simply modified by including the relevant mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. It was found that this simple modification based on reduced mechanical properties gave reasonable results, but not at higher temperatures. Therefore, they were further modified to obtain a more accurate design equation at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of new design rules was then verified by comparing their predictions with the results obtained from the parametric study. This thesis presents a description of the experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research and the results including comparison with simply modified current design rules. It describes the laboratory experiments at ambient and elevated temperatures. It also describes the finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research that included the appropriate mechanical properties, initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses. Finally, it presents the details of the new design equations proposed for the light <b>gauge</b> coldformed <b>steel</b> compression members subjected to distortional buckling effects at elevated temperatures...|$|R
