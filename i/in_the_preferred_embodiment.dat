5000|$|Clarification/broadening of the {{independent}} claim: Independent claims are typically written with very broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering {{some aspect of the}} basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a dependent claim is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that {{the independent}} claim must be different from, and therefore broader than, the dependent claim [...] The doctrine dictates that it [...] "is improper for courts to read into an independent claim a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim." [...] This means that if an independent claim recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a dependent claim depending from the independent recites a chair with 4 legs, the independent claim is not limited to what is recited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dependent claim. The dependent claim protects chairs with 4 legs, and the independent claim protects chairs with 4 legs as well as chairs having 2, 3, 5 or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a [...] "base" [...] includes a [...] "set of legs." [...] A dependent claim, including the phrase, [...] "wherein said base comprises a set of legs," [...] if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that <b>the</b> word base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> independent claim does not necessarily include legs. In practice, dependent claims are often used to home <b>in</b> on <b>the</b> inventor's <b>preferred</b> <b>embodiment</b> of <b>the</b> invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The independent claim broadly describes the invention; dependent claim #1 describes <b>the</b> invention <b>in</b> a narrower aspect that more specifically describes <b>the</b> <b>preferred</b> embodiment; dependent claim #2 is narrower still; etc.|$|R
