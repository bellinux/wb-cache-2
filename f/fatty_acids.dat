5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E

50|$|Acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} (ACC) is {{a complex}} multifunctional enzyme system.

Patterns of sizing performance and aluminum content of the handsheets {{were similar to those}} for the rosin soap size-alum sizing systems, although the patterns of calcium content were different. Solid-state 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the handsheets revealed that <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> calcium salt was the predominant size component in the handsheets prepared using tap water. This calcium salt is formed from the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> soap size (<b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> potassium salt) by ion exchange with calcium ion in pulp suspensions and retained on pulp fibers through aluminum compounds originating from alum added. On the other hand, when deionized water was used, free <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was the major component in the handsheets. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> aluminum salt was present as a minor component in the handsheets prepared in both tap water and deionized water systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cardiac <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake occurs {{predominantly}} via sarcolemmal transporter proteins; <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> translocase (FAT/CD 36), {{plasma membrane}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> binding protein (FABPpm) and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> transporter proteins (FATP) 1 and 6. We hypothesised that {{levels of the}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> transporters would be reduced in the chronically infarcted rat heart, in parallel with reduced dependence on <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> utilisation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vivo left ventricular ejection fractions, measured using echocardiography, were 36 % lower in rats six months after coronary artery ligation than in sham-operated control rats. In isolated, perfused, infarcted hearts, 3 H-palmitate oxidation was 30 % lower, and correlated with in vivo ejection fractions. As myocardial lipid incorporation was also reduced by 25 %, total palmitate utilisation was 29 % lower in the infarcted rat heart. The protein levels of the cardiac <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> transporters were reduced in the infarcted rat heart; FAT/CD 36 by 36 %, FABPpm by 12 %, FATP 6 by 21 % and FATP 1 by 26 %, and the cytosolic <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> binding protein (cFABP) was 47 % lower than in sham-operated rat hearts. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> transporter levels correlated with both palmitate oxidation rates and cardiac ejection fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation and lipid incorporation rates were accompanied by downregulation of the cardiac <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> transporters. The metabolic shift away from <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> utilisation was proportional {{to the degree of}} functional impairment in the chronically infarcted rat heart...|$|R

5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are 18-carbon polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
