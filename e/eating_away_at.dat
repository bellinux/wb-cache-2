25|$|The Great Falls of the Missouri River formed {{because the}} Missouri is flowing over {{and through the}} Kootenai Formation, a mostly nonmarine {{sandstone}} laid down by rivers, glaciers, and lakes in the past.

Until relatively recently (in geologic time) the Missouri River in the area had a much wider channel, but it has now settled into its current course, where {{it will continue to}} cut more deeply into the sandstone.|$|E
25|$|W+K's {{strategy}} for Nike had consistently been to eschew targeting specific target markets, favouring advertisements and sponsorships of athletes with wide general appeal. The approach was successful; by 2001, Nike's U.S. sales were {{three times that}} of their nearest competitor, Reebok. However, Reebok had just launched an aggressive new campaign for their new RBK line of shoes, backed by celebrities such as Allen Iverson, Jadakiss, R. Kelly, and Missy Elliott. They also had just signed a 10-year deal to provide equipment and uniforms to the NBA, a contract previously held by Nike. Other companies, such as Adidas and New Balance were also <b>eating</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> Nike's market share.|$|E

500|$|Many scientists, {{including}} Robert Ballard, {{are concerned}} that visits by tourists in submersibles and the recovery of artifacts are causing the wreck to decay faster. Underwater bacteria have been <b>eating</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> Titanics steel and transformed it into rust since the ship sank, {{but because of the}} extra damage caused by visitors, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that [...] "the hull and structure of the ship may collapse to the ocean floor within the next 50years." [...] The promenade deck has deteriorated significantly in recent years, partly because of damage caused by submersibles landing on the ship. The mast has almost completely deteriorated and has been stripped of its bell and brass light. Other damage includes a gash on the bow section where block letters once spelled Titanic, part of the brass telemotor which once held the ship's wooden wheel is now twisted and the crow's nest has completely deteriorated. The Canadian director James Cameron is responsible for some of the more significant damage during his expedition to the ship in 1995 to acquire footage for his film Titanic two years later. One of the MIR submersibles used on the expedition collided with the hull, damaging both and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. Captain Smith's quarters were heavily damaged by the collapse of the external bulkhead, which exposed the cabin's interior.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} quatrain, the sonnet shifts from a {{positive}} tone of admiration {{in the first}} quatrain to a somewhat more critical tone. The speaker says {{that the young man}} is not only betrothed to himself, but is also <b>eating</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> himself and leaving nothing behind where there could be [...] "abundance", thus making the young man his own enemy. Line five, [...] "But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes", is not only complimenting the young man, but is also scolding him for [...] "refusing sexual relations". Shakespeare then goes on to give the imagery of a candle eating itself, [...] "Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel", which can be tied to gluttony in the thirteenth line. In the last two lines of the second quatrain, [...] "Making a famine where abundance lies, Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel", Shakespeare uses the paradoxes of [...] "famine" [...] and [...] "abundance" [...] and then [...] "sweet self" [...] and [...] "cruel" [...] to describe the selfishness of the young man. To the speaker, it is a crime against man and nature to just simply eat away at [...] "the world's due" [...] without reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the {{municipality}} {{decided to build}} a garbage dump near the archeological zone of San Rafael without informing the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH). Since 2006, it has been known that the dump sits on {{the southern part of}} the site proper and that the digging of the dump site is estimated to have destroyed between eight and ten pyramids. [...] More vestiges of the site lie 300 meters below the dump. The municipality promised for years to move the facility and from 2006, state and federal authorities have promised to replace it with a new one farther away. However, as of 2009, the dump is still operating taking on as much as forty tons of trash per week, as the new facility was not yet finished. In 2007, a smaller, above ground dump appeared in the same area, within sight of visible ruins. During this time, acids and other substances produced by the pit have probably caused damage to the limestone of the site, <b>eating</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> structures made of the substance. The site belongs to the Río Verde Culture and its estimated to extend over 10km2. Its importance has been compared to that of Tamtoc in San Luis Potosí [...]|$|E
