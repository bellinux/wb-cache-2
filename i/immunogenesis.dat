5000|$|Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a {{neuroscience}} pioneer, {{concluded that}} the generation of neurons occurs only in the prenatal phase of human development, not after birth. This theory had long been the fundamental principle of neuroscience. [...] However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian neurogenesis was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain.In the intact adult mammalian brain, neuroregeneration maintains the function {{and structure of the}} central nervous system (CNS). The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle. Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain pathological conditions. However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain. However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without <b>immunogenesis</b> or tumorigenesis.|$|E

40|$|Although an immunoregulatory role of aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (Ahr) has been demonstrated in T cells and macrophages, {{little is known about}} its function in dendritic cells (DC). Here, we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG stimulate Ahr expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). Furthermore, we found that Ahr is required to induce indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) expression, an immunosuppressive enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine (Kyn) and other metabolites in DC. In the presence of LPS or CpG, Ahr-deficient (Ahr−/−) mature BMDC induced immune responses characterized by reduced Kyn and IL- 10 production compared with results observed with tolerogenic mature WT BMDC. In a coculture system with LPS- or CpG-stimulated BMDC and naive T cells, Ahr−/− BMDC inhibited naive T-cell differentiation into regulatory T (Treg) cells, which likely facilitated Th 17 cell development and promoted naive T-cell proliferation. Addition of synthetic L-Kyn to the coculture system skewed the differentiation of naive T cells to Treg cells rather than Th 17 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a previously unknown negatively regulatory role for Ahr in DC-mediated <b>immunogenesis</b> in the presence of LPS or CpG, which, in turn, alters the Kyn-dependent generation of Treg cells and Th 17 cells from naive T cells...|$|E

The peripheral blood was also found to contain a small number of medium sized IgG and IgM-positive cells. Both the spleen and the peripheral blood showed a considerable number of fluorescent small lymphocytes which exclusively contained IgM.

The lesions were more prominent in the ventricular walls and the septum. The fact that the infiltrates were predominant in the animals sacrificed at a shorter time after first inoculation and that fibrosis was more severe in those sacrificed at a longer time suggests that there is a progression of the infiltrative lesions to fibrosis, with a leukocytic activity indicative of a chronic phase.

40|$|Observations on {{the absence}} of an immune {{response}} in the immature young of a number of species and on the ability to induce in them a state of immunological tolerance of certain antigens have supported the hypothesis on the existence of an immunological "null " period during embryonic development of mammals. This state of immunological immaturity is widely assumed to persist throughout the intra-uterine existence of the fetus, and to terminate only at or shortly after birth (1 - 3); indeed, a varying degree of immunological incompetence has been observed in certain species for some time after birth (4, 5). It has become increasingly evident, however, that the timing of <b>immunogenesis</b> may vary appreciably from one species to another.

Experimental studies were performed on 257 nembutal (40 mg/kg) -anesthetized noninbred male albino rats weighing 200 — 230 g. Severe mechanical injury was simulated by the Noble-Collip procedure. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and glutathione reductase and the level of reduced glutathione were determined in the peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and thymus within 30 posttraumatic days. Conclusion. The specific features of changes have been revealed in the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the lymphocytes and organs of immunogenesis: there is a preponderance of discoordination in the antiperox-ide system of peripheral lymphocytes and in the antioxidative defense system of lymphoid organs. The posttraumatic inactivation of the enzymes is associated with their baseline levels: the higher activity of an enzyme is seen in the lymphocytes of a healthy organism and accordingly its implication in the inactivation of excess products of free radicals, the more significant reduction is in its activity in injury. The abnormal changes in the metabolic resource of the lymphocytic antioxidative system, occurring {{in the early stages of}} traumatic disease, persisted within 3 weeks and they tended to normalize only by day 30. The impaired enzymatic activity in the lymphoid cell antiradical and antiperoxide defense accounts for the diminished functional capacities of the immune system in the posttraumatic period.

However, {{the extent to which}} the proteome shapes the peptidome is still largely unknown. Here we present a high-throughput mass-spectrometry-based workflow that allows stringent and accurate identification of thousands of such peptides and direct determination of binding motifs. Applying the workflow to seven cancer cell lines and primary cells, yielded more than 22, 000 unique HLA peptides across different allelic binding specificities. By computing a score representing the HLA-I sampling density, we show a strong link between protein abundance and HLA-presentation (p < 0. 0001). When analyzing overpresented proteins - those with at least fivefold higher density score than expected for their abundance - we noticed that they are degraded almost 3 h faster than similar but nonpresented proteins (top 20 % abundance class; median half-life 20. 8 h versus 23. 6 h, p < 0. 0001). This validates protein degradation as an important factor for HLA presentation. Ribosomal, mitochondrial respiratory chain, and nucleosomal proteins are particularly well presented. Taking a set of proteins associated with cancer, we compared the predicted immunogenicity of previously validated T-cell epitopes with other peptides from these proteins in our data set. The validated epitopes indeed tend to have higher immunogenic scores than the other detected HLA peptides.

40|$|Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically {{predisposed}} skin disorder, characterised by thickened scaly plaques. Although no {{therapy is}} recognised as curative, therapies aimed at symptom control include biologic agents that are generally designed to block molecular activation of cellular pathways of a pathogenic immune response. Although biologics are {{often described as}} a class, they can be further sub-classified according to properties including structure and molecular target. For example, the two main groups of biologics {{for the treatment of}} psoriasis are those targeting cytokines and those targeting T-cells or antigen-presenting cells. Agents that inhibit cytokines can be broadly split into anti-p 40 agents, which target the p 40 subunit of IL- 12 and IL- 23 (such as ustekinumab), and anti-TNF agents. Anti-TNF agents may then be further divided into soluble receptors (etanercept) and monoclonal antibodies (adalimumab and infliximab). Even within the same subclass, agents may display variations in structure, function, route of administration and pharmacokinetics, which are reflected in their clinical profiles. For example, of the TNF antagonists, infliximab, provides a rapid onset of response, high efficacy, high peak serum concentrations, anti-granulomatous activity, potential for tuberculosis reactivation and frequent antibody formation; adalimumab provides a fast response, high efficacy, potential for tuberculosis reactivation and the possibility of antibody formation; and etanercept provides a slower response, good efficacy, rare antibody formation and is rarely linked to tuberculosis cases. This suggests that biologic agents exhibit unique properties, which appear to be more relevant than a 'class effect' in assessing risk-benefit profiles for this diverse group of drugs. With a range of agents available, studying the <b>immunogenesis</b> of psoriasis is likely to be useful in profiling individuals best suited to the characteristics of particular drugs.

40|$|Abstract Background Laccases {{belong to}} multicopper oxidases, a {{widespread}} class of enzymes implicated in many oxidative functions in pathogenesis, <b>immunogenesis</b> and morphogenesis of organisms {{and in the}} metabolic turnover of complex organic substances. They catalyze the coupling between the four one-electron oxidations of {{a broad range of}} substrates with the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. These catalytic processes are made possible by the contemporaneous presence of at least four copper ion sites, classified according to their spectroscopic properties: one type 1 (T 1) site where the electrons from the reducing substrates are accepted, one type 2 (T 2), and a coupled binuclear type 3 pair (T 3) which are assembled in a T 2 /T 3 trinuclear cluster where the electrons are transferred to perform the O 2 reduction to H 2 O. Results The structure of a laccase from the white-rot fungus Lentinus (Panus) tigrinus, a glycoenzyme involved in lignin biodegradation, was solved at 1. 5 Å. It reveals a asymmetric unit containing two laccase molecules (A and B). The progressive reduction of the copper ions centers obtained by the long-term exposure of the crystals to the high-intensity X-ray synchrotron beam radiation under aerobic conditions and high pH allowed us to detect two sequential intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction pathway: the "peroxide" and the "native" intermediates, previously hypothesized through spectroscopic, kinetic and molecular mechanics studies. Specifically the electron-density maps revealed the presence of an end-on bridging, μ-η 1 :η 1 peroxide ion between the two T 3 coppers in molecule B, result of a two-electrons reduction, whereas in molecule A an oxo ion bridging the three coppers of the T 2 /T 3 cluster (μ 3 -oxo bridge) together with an hydroxide ion externally bridging the two T 3 copper ions, products of the four-electrons reduction of molecular oxygen, were best modelled. Conclusion This is the first structure of a multicopper oxidase which allowed the detection of two intermediates in the molecular oxygen reduction and splitting. The observed features allow to positively substantiate an accurate mechanism of dioxygen reduction catalyzed by multicopper oxidases providing general insights into the reductive cleavage of the O-O bonds, a leading problem in many areas of biology. </p...|$|E

Thus, the asthmatic triad increased levels of T-lymphocytes due to the high content of cytotoxic cells against decrease in NK-cells. In the AT group have low levels of B-lymphocytes, and as a consequence - reducing the concentration of immunoglobulin IgG 4 and sIgA. Thus, the immune status with polypous rhinosinusitis is characterized by the activation of B-lymphocytes with a decrease in T-cell immunity, thus to form a deployed asthmatic triad <b>immunogenesis</b> change occurs with the activation of T-lymphocytes, and reduction in humoral immunity. The study of cytokine profile in PRS and AT showed mixed imbalance of cytokine concentration: increasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory (IFN γ, TNF α), anti-inflammatory (IL- 4) and a decrease in the concentration of pro-inflammatory (IL- 6) cytokines in asthmatic triad compared with a group of polypous rhinosinusitis. Activation, proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes is under the control of IL- 2, IL- 6 and IL- 4, while IL- 10 and IFN γ opposite suppress immunoglobulin synthesis. In the study of the microbial landscape of the nasal mucosa showed an increase of the total number of microorganisms and bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae in the both group. In the group of the PRS was found to increase the total amount of bacteria and microorganisms of the genus Staphylococcus, Streptococcus relative to control. Thus, the group revealed AT and PRS increase the total number of conditionally pathogenic microbial flora in the background to reduce the systemic and local immunity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mouse spleen {{cells were}} {{subjected}} to a fractionation procedure designed to enrich for 4 -hydroxy- 3 -iodo- 5 -nitro-phenylacetyl (NIP) - or DNP- specific B lymphocytes, which depended on adherence of specific cells to a layer of hapten-gelatin at 4 degrees C, recovery of bound cells by melting, and digestion of adherent antigen by collagenase. A population of cells resulted which contained 90 % typical B cells and 37 % of cells capable of binding a fluorescent, haptenated polymeric protein. Fractionated cells were reacted in vitro with fluorescent conjugates of the specific haptens with polymerized flagellin [NIP-polymerized flagellin (POL) -tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate or DNP- POL-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate] {{under a variety of}} conditions, with the aim of investigating the behavior of Ig receptors on B lymphocytes after exposure to antigen; Experiments were performed with immunogenic and tolerogenic concentrations of antigen. Furthermore, four experimental designs were used, namely: (a) brief labeling with fluorescent antigen followed by culture without antigen (pulse design); (b) culture in the continuous presence of fluorescent antigen (continuous-labeling design); (c) culture in the continuous presence of nonlabeled antigen followed by labeling of unoccupied receptors by fluorescent antigen (receptor status design); and (d) culture with nonlabeled antigen for 2 h followed by incubation without further antigen for 20 h and labeling with fluorescent antigen (modulation design). Further insight into receptor occupancy and distribution was gained by the use of fluorescent antihapten and antiglobulin reagents. It was found that both immunogenic and tolerogenic antigen concentrations caused rapid patching and capping of the receptors to which they attached, followed by endocytosis and probably some shedding of Ig receptors. However, a proportion of cells continued to bear some cell surface antigen for 24 h. The immunogenic antigen concentration failed to completely remove the receptor coat from the cell surface. At all stages of <b>immunogenesis,</b> plentiful unoccupied receptors could be demonstrated. The tolerogenic concentration nearly saturated available receptors, and in its continuous presence, only few unoccupied or antigen-occupied surface receptors could be detected after 24 h of culture. Experiments of the modulation design showed that brief incubation with the tolerogenic concentration appeared to suppress receptor resynthesis, as few new receptors could be demonstrated after 20 h of further culture without antigen. Experiments were performed to determine whether fractionated cells prepared from spleens of 8 -day-old mice showed an unusual tendency for modulation, even with immunogenic antigen concentrations. They were found to behave essentially like adult fractionated cells. The results are discussed in the framework of current theories of B- lymphocyte activation and tolerization...|$|E
40|$|The {{brucellosis}} {{remains to}} one of the most urgent dangerous infections in regions with developed livestock production. An exclusive polymorphism of symptoms, variety of forms of a disease, small informational content of results of routine laboratory all-clinical inspection, quite often leads to diagnostic mistakes at a pre-hospital stage. Improvement of a complex of laboratory diagnosis of a brucellous infection demands development of the modern padding methods of verification based on cell-like factors of immunity as leaders in an <b>immunogenesis</b> and a pathogenesis of a brucellosis.  Considering the leading role of cell-like immunity in formation of protection against the majority of bacteriemic especially dangerous infections, studying of cell-like reaction in response to antigenic stimulation, it is necessary to consider the most informative (marker) and objective at assessment of immunologic reorganization of an organism at a disease or vaccination. The following markers (receptors) of activation of lymphocytes can act as perspective indexes of a specific cell-like antigenreactivity: CD 25 — a high-affine receptor of interleukin 2 (IL- 2 Ra), a marker of early activation of Tlymphocytes; HLA-DR — an antigen of the main complex of a histocompatibility of a class II, an expression of a marker is associated not only with late, but also long-lived activation of lymphocytes; CD 95 (Fas, APO- 1) — a receptor of an induction of an apoptosis (“cell death”), a marker of “late” activation (CD 4 + lymphocytes is presented mainly) and Fas L (CD 178) — a receptor of an induction of an apoptosis, expresses generally on CD 8 + cages. The work purpose — to estimate an opportunity and prospects of use of technology of a flowing cytofluorometry and the in vitro cell tests for diagnosis of a acute brucellosis. 35 people with the diagnosis “Acute brucellosis” and 12 people — not the patients who did not have a brucellosis, are not vaccinated against a brucellosis (control group) participated in a research. Blue blood served as material of a research. Defined quantity of the lymphocytes expressing receptors of CD 25, HLA-DR, CD 95, CD 95 L (CD 178)  at activation by a specific antigen. The received results processed statistically with use of Microsoft Excel 2010. During the research it is established that intensity an antigen-stimulated activation of lymphocytes of in vitro, it is possible to use as a marker of a acute brucellous infection at the person. The most perspective indexes of activation of lymphocytes of in vitro, it is possible to consider receptors to IL- 2 (CD 25) and apoptosis markers — CD 95, CD 95 L (CD 178). Thus, the conducted researches indicate an opportunity and the actual prospect of use of technology of a flowing cytofluorometry and cell-like in vitro tests for diagnostics of a acute brucellosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|The ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitides (ANCA-SVV) Wegener’s granulomatosis, {{microscopic}} polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss {{syndrome and}} renal-limited vasculitis are severe diseases {{that have a}} high mortality rate when left untreated. Current treatment protocols are based on non-specific immunosuppression, which is insuffi cient in preventing relapses and is characterized by severe side-eff ects. More eff ective and less toxic therapies are therefore needed. A {{better understanding of the}} pathogenic eff ector mechanisms underlying ANCA-SVV can improve the development of specific therapeutic strategies. The aim of this thesis was therefore to explore further the eff ector mechanisms involved in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, focusing on the discovery of targets for treatment and the testing of experimental therapies. More specifi cally, we concentrated on the importance of infl ammatory stimuli and ANCA IgG characteristics in disease and the therapeutic potential of interfering with leukocyte behaviour. ANCA-SVV: COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL DISEASES By definition, patients with autoimmune diseases have a loss of immunological tolerance towards an autoantigen, but it is usually less clear why such a break in tolerance occurs. In line with this, it is not known why ANCA autoantibodies develop in ANCA-SVV patients. In recent years, several theories have been proposed to explain the <b>immunogenesis</b> of ANCA-SVV. The theory of antigen complementarity assumes that antibodies directed against a protein or peptide (antisense) that is complementary to the ANCA antigen (sense) are generated. 1 A subsequent immune response against the antigen-binding part of these antibodies generates idiotypic antibodies that cross-react with the ANCA antigen. The antisense protein or peptide in this theory may be derived from aberrant antisense transcription or from pathogens. A second theory involves molecular mimicry of exogenous proteins with ANCA antigens. This theory assumes that the initial immune response is evoked against pathogen-derived peptides that are highly homologous to peptide sequences within the ANCA-antigens, resulting in a cross-reactive immune response against the ANCA self antigens. Evidence for the occurrence of molecular mimicry in ANCA-SVV is provided by a study showing that circulating autoantibodies against lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP- 2), a heavily glycosylated type 1 membrane protein involved in cellular adhesion and homeostasis, were highly prevalent in patients with MPO-ANCA- and Pr 3 - ANCA-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis. 2. These anti-LAMP- 2 antibodies were able to activate neutrophils and endothelial cells in vitro, whereas injection of these antibodies into rats induced pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Most interestingly, the authors showed that a major epitope recognized by anti-LAMP- 2 antibodies was highly homologous to FimH- 1, a bacterial adhesin of common gram-negative bacteria. When rats were immunized with FimH- 1, antibodies directed against FimH- 1 were generated that cross-reacted with LAMP- 2. Importantly, these rats also developed necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. ...|$|E
