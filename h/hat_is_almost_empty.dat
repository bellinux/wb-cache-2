60|$|It is Sunday morning. The frozen village street <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> We march down to {{the wider}} space where the bus stands: I hope they haven't the impudence {{to call it a}} Piazza.|$|R
50|$|On the {{day that}} the Holtzclaw trial opened, the {{courtroom}} <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> OKC Artists for Justice, an Oklahoma City-based advocacy group, was founded by two Oklahoma City residents to organize support for the women.|$|R

50|$|The Double Terai <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> {{a version}} of the Terai slouch hat, but with a double {{thickness}} crown and brim, designed to give extra sun protection. This <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> de rigour in East and Central Africa from the 1930s to 1950s.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{left his}} {{companion}} loitering along Pall Mall, {{still a little}} puzzled. He called a taxi and drove to Devenham House.

60|$|Two {{men were}} sitting in the smoking-room of a London club.

25|$|Though Poland-Lithuania was at {{that time}} the largest {{and one of the most}} populous states of Europe, Sobieski became a king of a country devastated by almost half a century of {{constant}} war. The treasury <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty</b> and the court had little to offer the powerful magnates, who often allied themselves with foreign courts rather than the state.|$|R
50|$|Population {{distribution}} in Brazil is very uneven. The majority of Brazilians live within 300 kilometers of the coast, while the interior in the Amazon Basin <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> Therefore, the densely populated areas {{are on the}} coast and the sparsely populated areas are in the interior. This historical pattern is little changed by recent movements into the interior.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the lower}} chamber <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty,</b> bubbles of steam {{mix with the}} upstreaming water, {{producing}} a characteristic gurgling noise. This [...] "strombolian phase" [...] allows a mixture of superheated steam and water {{to pass through the}} coffee, which leads to undesirable results, and therefore brewing should be stopped by removing the pot from the stove as soon as this stage is reached.|$|R
50|$|Because its {{sole purpose}} is flood mitigation, the {{retention}} basin behind the dam <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> always <b>empty</b> of water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{am sorry}} {{to say that the}} Governor General {{considers}} your demands are altogether excessive.

60|$|The cab {{pulled up}} in front of a very ordinary-looking cafe in a side street leading from one of the boulevards.

60|$|At half-past three the {{restaurant}} <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> Very soon after four I {{rang the bell}} of Lady Dennisford's town house in Park Lane. The man who opened it stared at my request to see her Ladyship. Eventually, however, I persuaded him to take in a message. I wrote a single word upon a plain card, and in five minutes I was shown into a small boudoir.|$|R
60|$|Bill {{made his}} way along the swaying train to the smoking-car, which <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b> It had come upon him {{overwhelmingly}} that he needed tobacco. He was in the mood when a man must either smoke or give up altogether the struggle with Fate. He lit his pipe, and looked {{out of the window}} at Long Island racing past him. It was only a blur to him.|$|R
50|$|Network Rail, a large rail {{infrastructure}} provider in the UK, uses passenger delay minutes {{as a mechanism}} to reward and punish for services being on time and late respectively. Using delay minutes as a measure allows for comparisons between heavily loaded large transport vehicles, and much smaller or lightly loaded vehicles. The economic cost of a large transport vehicle being delayed {{is much greater than}} a service that <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>empty.</b>|$|R
