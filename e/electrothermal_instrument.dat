30|$|Column {{chromatography}} (CC) used {{silica gel}} 60 (70 – 230 mesh, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Preparative thin-layer chromatography (Prep-TLC) used Kieselgel 60 PF 254 (0.5  mm Merck Millipore, Darmstadt Germany). Benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), EDTA, 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB), glutathione-s-transferase, potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), carboxylesterase and 4 -nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The melting point was recorded on an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>instrument.</b> Optical rotations were determined on a JASCO DIP- 370 digital polarimeter using a 50  mm microcell (1  ml). UV spectra were measured in EtOH or MeOH with a JASCO 530 spectrometer, and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 2000. The 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, DEPT, and 2 -D NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend™ 400  MHz or Bruker AVANCE 500  MHz. in CDCl 3 using TMS as an internal standard, unless otherwise stated. Finally, HR-TOF-MS results were recorded on a Micromass model VQ-TOF 2.|$|E
