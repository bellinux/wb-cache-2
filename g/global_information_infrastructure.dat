40|$|The {{developing}} {{national and}} <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (NII/GII) {{are being built}} upon the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) telecommunications protocol and associated protocol standards. These protocols are themselves under development through the telecommunications standards process defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which as a body is sanctioned by the United Nations. All telecommunications manufacturers use these standards to create products that can interoperate. The ITU has recognized the ATM Forum as the instrument {{for the development of}} ATM protocols. This forum is a consortium of industry, academia, and government entities formed to quickly develop standards for the ATM infrastructure. However, because the participants represent a predominately terrestrial network viewpoint, the use of satellites in the national and <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> could be severely compromised. Consequently, through an ongoing task order, the NASA Lewis Research Center asked Sterling Software, Inc., to communicate with the ATM Forum in support of the interoperability of satellite-terrestrial networks. This year, Dr. Raj Jain of the Ohio State University, under contract to Sterling, authored or coauthored 32 explanatory documents delivered to the ATM Forum in the areas of Guaranteed Frame Rate for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Available Bit Rate, performance testing, Variable Bit Rate voice over ATM, TCP over Unspecified Bit Rate+, Virtual Source/Virtual Destination, and network management. These contributions have {{had a significant impact on}} the content of the standards that the ATM Forum is developing. Some of the more significant accomplishments have been: (1) The adoption by the ATM Forum of a new definition for Message-In, Message-Out latency; and (2) Improved text (clearer wording and newly defined terms) for measurement procedures, foreground and background traffic, and scalable configuration in the latency and throughput sections of the Performance Testing Baseline Text...|$|R

40|$|Librarians {{are striving}} to insure that {{libraries}} are part of emerging national and <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The creation of these infrastructures is typically presented as being the result of developments in information technology, in particular, the convergence of computing and telecommunications. Such a view encourages librarians to be lulled into thinking the challenge facing them is solely technical. This is not the case. The potential transformation of libraries due to developments in information technology cannot be divorced from political and economic forces driving technological change. Consequently, this paper argues {{that there is a}} need for a political economy of librarianship. 1.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) model for business organization, new enterprise systems are constructed by integrating existing one. The integration is achieved through the composition of components selected from either a collection of components provided by the participating enterprise systems or external trusted sources. The process of component selection and composition is hindered by numerous problems at all levels of interoperability. This paper proposed the use of semantic trading to tackle interoperability problems mainly at the semantic level. 1. Motivation The convergence of several threads of technology and business imperatives makes the Virtual Enterprise model for business organization both feasible and appealing. The effectiveness and efficiency of the model depends on the development of flexible <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> These infrastructures should support the dynamic composition and configuration of components.

40|$|Modern {{information}} systems engineering {{has to deal}} with the situation that <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are built on a variety of existing autonomous legacy systems and have to be maintained and evolved over a long time. Mediation denotes the logical or semantic integration of heterogeneous data for read access within such tightly coupled federations. We introduce model correspondence assertions (MoCA) for model-based design and evolution of mediators. The MoCA language is placed into the information viewpoint of ODP against the background of an object-oriented paradigm. In detail, MoCAs specify relationships between structural object-oriented schemas. We distinguish four kinds of correspondences to address the development of mediators and their working including query processing. The most important objectives of MoCAs are to support integrating as well as metadata-based mediation approaches, to enable the specification of correspondences independent of the computational design, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{networks}} {{involve the}} transmission and reception of {{large volumes of}} data. Research indicates that network traffic volumes will continue to increase. These traffic volumes will be unprecedented and the behaviour of <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> when dealing with these data volumes is unknown. It {{has been shown that}} complex systems (including computer networks) exhibit self organized criticality under certain conditions. Given the possibility in such systems of a sudden and spontaneous system reset the development of techniques to inform system administrators of this behavior could be beneficial. This article focuses on the combination of two dissimilar research concepts, namely sonification (a form of auditory display) and self organized criticality (SOC). A system is described that sonifies in real time an <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure's</b> self organized criticality to alert the network administrators of both normal and abnormal network traffic and operation. It is shown how the system makes changes in a system's SOC readily perceptible. Implications for how such a system may support real-time situational awareness and post-hoc incident analysis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It can {{be argued}} that {{pervasive}} access to information and services becomes more valuable when they are related and adapted to the real world situations of their use. We discuss sensor-based approaches to awareness of such situations based on experience from two projects, one investigating context-awareness as add-on technology for mobile devices, and the other exploring the use of everyday things as context suppliers. INTRODUCTION Global and mobile networks make information and computer-based services available almost everywhere irrespective of location, embedded technologies let <b>global</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> stretch far into our everyday environments, and advances in information interfaces extend accessibility. Beyond the ultimate availability and accessibility an entirely new quality is added when information and services get related and adapted to the real world situations in which they are used.

40|$|The preface {{deals with}} some basic {{issues in the}} social and {{organizational}} study of information systems along three directions of analysis. The first direction draws attention on how phenomenological concepts make it possible to recast the idea and the use of formal representations in computer programming as a challenge for the information systems design. The second direction of analysis focuses on the changes in the practices of planning, designing, and deploying information systems in the case of <b>global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> implemented across multiple sites within large branch-plan organizational structures. It further shows how these changes challenge core assumptions embedded in received notions of phenomenology via ethnomethodology, and discusses the biographic turn in the social study of <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The third direction deals with the issues of whether and how organizational re-design associated with the introduction of ICTs in work settings is still possible even though the starting point is the focus on 'unique and singular worlds' which, actually, challenges the word of 'design'. It further discusses different conceptualizations of the concept-word of 'ICT-related organizational design' and different approaches to techno-organizational re-design. Finally, it addresses the issues of whether and how it is possible to carry out ICT- related organizational change processes consistently with organizational members’ requirements, and discusses the role of conflicts and power in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Although new {{technologies}} such as xDSL and PONs will soon permit a direct and continuos access to <b>Global</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructures,</b> such as the Internet, of residential and SOHO (small office-home office) users, dial-up access via analog modems over PSTN remains the most frequent approach. The ever increasing number of Internet users adopting this access modality is leading to two kind of problems: (1) a dimensioning problem for the ISPs which have to properly define the number of modems to guarantee a low refuse probability for the incoming traffic (dial-up connections); (2) terrible implications on dimensioning problems of the PSTN which was designed {{on the basis of}} assumptions strongly modified by the new statistical nature of ISP access connections. The paper presents an extensive measurement analysis carried out collecting traffic data offered to an Internet Dial-up access server. The characterisation of the arrival process and the Call Holding Time (CHT) distribution is presented. The analyses have pointed out the Tail Heaviness of the CHT distribution and a non-negligible correlation of the arrival process.

40|$|The {{research}} on distributed {{intrusion detection system}} (DIDS) is a rapidly growing area of interest because the existence of centralized intrusion detection system (IDS) techniques is increasingly unable to protect the <b>global</b> distributed <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Distributed analysis employed by Agent-based DIDS is an accepted fabulous method. Clustering-based intrusion detection technique overcomes the drawbacks of relying on labeled training data which most current anomaly-based intrusion detection depend on. Clustering-based DIDS technique according to the advantages of two techniques is presented. For effectively choosing the attacks, twice clustering is employed: the first clustering is to choose the candidate anomalies at Agent IDS and the second clustering is to choose the true attack at central IDS. At last, through experiment on the KDD CUP 1999 data records of network connections verified that the methods put forward is better.
