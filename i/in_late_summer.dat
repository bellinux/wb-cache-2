5|$|Other {{collections}} sites include Australia, Chile, China, Cuba, Iceland, Korea, and Taiwan. In Hawaii, {{it grows}} on trunks of fallen Cibotium and Aleurites trees. A.sarcoides occurs most frequently <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females {{lay their}} eggs on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, digging into the {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> they pupate in soil.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. The fungus {{has been noted}} to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
50|$|The she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) is a large, long-tailed, snake-like skink {{endemic to}} Tasmania, Australia. It is viviparous; mating in spring, and giving birth <b>in</b> <b>latest</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{organism}} wherein generations {{overlap in}} time, {{and so are}} not completely reproductively isolated. For example, in bees of the subfamily Halictinae, one generation is produced in the early summer and one <b>in</b> the <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> but males produced in the early summer may also mate <b>in</b> the <b>late</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> large shoals of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) fry congregate {{around the}} margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Chew Valley also holds a large {{population}} of pike (Esox lucius), and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer.</b> Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
5|$|The child Baldwin V of Jerusalem died <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> 1186. Raymond of Tripoli and his {{supporters}} could not prevent BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, from seizing the throne. Baldwin of Ibelin, who was the only Jerusalemite baron to refuse {{to pay homage to}} Sybilla and Guy after their coronation, moved to Antioch. Bohemond granted a fief to him.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} {{of plants and}} animals changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E

5|$|This sparrow is awkward {{in flight}} and {{primarily}} uses running and hopping to move. The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and early autumn. During the winter they can occasionally {{be found in}} loose mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{tropical}} cyclone activity peaks <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> when {{the difference between}} temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month {{in which all the}} {{tropical cyclone}} basins are active.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer.</b> It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Found in marshes, swamps, ditches and ponds. Blooms <b>in</b> the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> {{to early}} fall.|$|R

5|$|Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who {{landed at}} Acre <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> 1217, invited Bohemond {{to join the}} Fifth Crusade. Bohemond and his vassals marched to Acre. However, the crusade ended in failure {{because of the lack}} of a united command. Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{together}} with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh's half-sister, Melisende of Lusignan, in Tripoli. During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E

5000|$|The White River is navigable {{by small}} boats {{throughout}} most of its length. But in low water years the water level may be too low for navigation {{for a period of}} several months.

5|$|Suillus brevipes grows singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. A common—and {{sometimes}} abundant—mushroom, it occurs over most of North America (including Hawaii), south to Mexico, and north to Canada. This species {{has been found in}} Puerto Rico growing under planted Pinus caribaea, where it is thought to have been introduced inadvertently from North Carolina by the USDA Forest Service in 1955. Other introductions have also occurred in exotic pine plantations in Argentina, India, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and early fall, they have often weakened {{by the time they}} reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|T. floccosus forms {{symbiotic}} (ectomycorrhizal) {{relationships with}} {{various types of}} conifer, growing in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from North Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. Though mild-tasting, they generally cause gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea when consumed. T. floccosus is eaten by local people in northeastern India, Nepal and Mexico.|$|E
50|$|At {{low water}} <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of dry years the {{remnants}} of three villages (Asel, Bringhausen, and Berich) and a bridge across the original river bed submerged when the lake was filled in 1914 can be seen.
