2500|$|... "We {{wrote to}} the club just over a week ago and their solicitors {{acknowledged}} that letter. We have so far had no response though about when we can all have a face-to-face meeting. We propose a meeting to discuss all the issues, because it just seems the sensible thing to do. To be honest I am not surprised by anything they do anymore. They can say all the threats and deadlines they want but we won’t {{come to an end}} of the matter until they sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us." ...|$|E

Hiro finally changes things by sitting <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the man before he kills himself and convincing him that it's not worth it.|$|R
60|$|They found Ellen West in {{the sitting}} room when they went in. She laid her glasses down on the book she had been reading and looked at them in amazement tinctured with {{something}} else. But she shook hands amiably with Mr. Meredith <b>and</b> he sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, while Rosemary hunted out his book.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{so sorry}} for yourself," [...] she answered, [...] "that you seem {{scarcely}} to need my sympathy. However, sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me reasonably." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} thing to be done," [...] said Flambeau, [...] "whether it belongs to this world or the other. I must go <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|Even in fair weather {{he seldom}} has anyone to speak to. A visit from an idle {{man who will}} sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> have a pipe <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> with him is a day to be long remembered and even to date events from.

6000|$|... "He stopped {{away from}} the factory longer. Men with tattoo marks I didn't know came <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} brought no trade. I thought he ran risks and warned him, but he laughed. It went on, and we were getting rich when the change began. Our trade did not fall off much, but one felt a difference----" ...|$|R
60|$|Poor thing! She {{began to}} cry {{as soon as she}} began to speak. Of course, we sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, <b>and</b> said {{everything}} we could think of to reassure her. And in about half an hour she began to be much more cheerful, and to look as if the world might have something satisfactory in it after all.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty laughed. [...] "I am growing up," [...] she said. [...] "Three {{years ago}} you wouldn't have wasted those speeches on me. Well, you can sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Flora." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] she murmured. [...] "Do you {{remember}} the old days, {{when you were a}} very timid young secretary of Sir George Nomsom, and I was a maid-of-honour at the Viennese Court? Dear me, how you have changed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{nice of you}} to {{come and}} see me," [...] she murmured, with a {{lingering}} touch of the fingers. [...] "Do take that easy-chair, please, and sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. Your roses were beautiful, but whatever made you send them to me?" ...|$|E

During their performance, the duo lit up the stage with a high-energy set, {{complete}} with handstands and full-size cardboard cutouts of Barack Obama and Einstein. The duo sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Gene Simmons of Kiss in Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern after meeting at a local radio station.|$|R
5000|$|In {{working with}} the board, I {{used to have to}} do cash flow, project sales, percents of increases…and I really didn’t think I could do it...(but) Brick came <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me one day, and I thought (afterwards) I could do six times more than what he wanted me to do...He gave me the {{determination}} and made me feel that I was a chosen one; I really, really (felt) chosen.

60|$|They {{were alone}} in the hotel but for a fat Frenchwoman of middle age, a Rabelaisian figure with a broad, obscene laugh. She spent the day by the river patiently fishing for fish she never caught, and Philip {{sometimes}} went <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her. He found out that she had belonged to a profession whose most notorious member for our generation was Mrs. Warren, and having made a competence she now lived the quiet life of the bourgeoise. She told Philip lewd stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, Harry; but he can do it. Oh, Harry! But come and sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. I told your father to be out, so that I might have you alone; and the dear girls are gone into Buntingford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Daren Lane!" [...] she exclaimed, with fervor, {{and to his}} surprise, {{she kissed}} him. There was no doubt of her pleasure. Lane's thin armor melted. He had not {{anticipated}} such welcome. [...] "Oh, I'm glad to see you, soldier boy. But you're a man now. Daren, you're white and thin. Handsomer, though!... Sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me a little." ...|$|E
60|$|And, though I {{understood}} not her meaning, I went, {{glad to see}} the Red Room once more. So {{she made}} me sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, which I did, for shyness was no failing of mine; and she asked me many questions, and some that I thought she should not have asked, but I could not answer them, so 'twere little harm.|$|E
60|$|Laura busied herself {{about the}} stove, while Waynefleet sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Nasmyth about generalities. Waynefleet {{appeared}} to be a politician, and he criticized the Government, which, in his opinion, was neglecting the Bush-ranchers shamefully. It was evident that he considered it the duty of the Government to contribute indirectly towards the support of settlers. Then the supper was laid out. As he ate fastidiously, he made a few faintly sardonic observations about the cookery, and, after the girl had brought in a pot of coffee, he frowned at the cup he put down.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Easterfield made Olive sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> she <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, {{but there}} was no {{changing}} the girl's determination to go to her uncle, to go alone, and to go immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the cook}} {{come up and}} told me," [...] said the mate, in answer, [...] "I see at once what was up, so I went <b>down</b> <b>and</b> just <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him clever like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not; I {{want you}} to help me, and come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the skipper, for he will be under your orders, you know. He is such a {{delightful}} sailor-man, perfect down to his quid, and always says, 'Ay, ay,' in the orthodox fashion. Certainly you must not go; I will not trust you out of my sight--you might run away and leave me alone, and then what should I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no--that cost {{comes out}} of their own funds, Mrs. Blackburn takes care to tell me, and Miss Hacket will find some one in Siverfold who will provide tables and forms and crockery. I must go <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Miss Hacket as soon as lessons are over. Or perhaps it would save time and trouble if I wrote and asked her to come up to luncheon and see the {{capabilities}} of the place. Why, what's the matter?' pausing at the blank looks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} a long time, I have a little scheme," [...] he said, [...] "and I have been to Washington to see Watling, to talk over it. Well, he thinks much of you. Fowndes and Ripon are good lawyers, {{but they are not}} smart like you. See Paret, he says, and he can come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. So I ask you to come here. That is why I say you are wise to get home. Honeymoons can wait--eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. No; but {{you asked}} me <b>to</b> come <b>down</b> here <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you; <b>and</b> you {{mentioned}} casually that if I didnt youd have nobody <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about me <b>to</b> but Bentley. That was a threat, was it not? ...|$|R

6000|$|Mention {{has been}} made already of Mark Twain's {{tendency}} to [...] absentmindedness. He was always forgetting engagements, or getting [...] them wrong. Once he hurried to an afternoon party, and finding the [...] mistress of the house alone, sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her comfortably [...] {{for an hour or}} two, not remembering his errand at all. It was only [...] when he reached home that he learned that the party had taken place [...] the week before. It was always dangerous for him to make [...] engagements, and he never seemed to profit by sorrowful experience. [...] We, however, may profit now by one of his amusing apologies.|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I know well," [...] Lutchester continued, [...] "that ambassadors are but the figureheads in the world's history. Speak {{to me of}} {{the things}} which concern our nations, Nikasti. Tell me of the letter you bear to the Emperor. You have nothing to lose. Sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, man to man. You have heard Germany. Hear England. Tell me of the {{promises}} made to you within the last hour, and I will show you how they can never be kept. Let us talk of your country's future. You and I can tell one another much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to see you," [...] was her simple answer. [...] "Now sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me; {{tell me all about}} yourself. Stop; before you begin--how very curious it is! Do you know I dreamed about you last night--such a curious, painful dream. I dreamed that I was asleep in my room--which indeed I was--and that it was blowing a gale and raining in torrents--which I believe it was also--so there is nothing very {{wonderful}} about that. But now comes the odd part. I dreamed that you were standing out in the rain and wind and yet looking at me as though you saw me. I could not see your face because you were in the dark, but I knew it was you. Then I woke up with a start. It was a most vivid dream. And now to-day you have come to see me after all these years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Howells and Clemens were {{corresponding}} regularly again, {{though not}} [...] with {{the frequency of}} former years. Perhaps neither of them was [...] bubbling over with things to say; perhaps it was becoming yearly [...] less attractive {{to pick up a}} pen and write, and then, of course, [...] there was always the discouragement of distance. Once Howells [...] wrote: [...] "I know this will find you in Austria before I can well turn [...] round, but I must make believe you are in Kennebunkport before I can [...] begin it." [...] And in another letter: [...] "It ought to be as pleasant to [...] sit down and write to you as to sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, but it [...] isn't..... The only reason why I write is that I want another [...] letter from you, and because I have a whole afternoon for the job. [...] I have the whole of every afternoon, for I cannot work later than [...] lunch. I am fagged by that time, and Sunday is the only day that [...] brings unbearable leisure. I hope you will be in New York another [...] winter; then I shall {{know what to do with}} these foretastes of [...] eternity." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2010, {{his book}} 2010: Living in the Future was popularised by a blog which {{compared}} Hoyle's 38-year-old predictions {{with the reality}} of modern life. This led to a Facebook campaign <b>to</b> track <b>down</b> Hoyle <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about his visions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Outlaw you? O my boy, my darling, my pride! Get {{off your}} horse, and don't sit there, hand on hip, like a turbaned Saracen, defying God and man; but come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> reason <b>to</b> me, {{for the sake}} of St. Peter and all saints." ...|$|R
