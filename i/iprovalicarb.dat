50|$|Fluopicolide is a {{fungicide}} used {{in agriculture}} to control diseases caused by oomycetes such as late blight of potato. It is classed as an acylpicolide and its chemical name is 2,6-dichloro-N-3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinylmethyl benzamide. The precise {{mode of action}} is not known, but it is thought to act by affecting spectrin-like proteins in the cytoskeleton of oomycetes. This mode of action differs from other available fungicides used to control oomycetes and it can inhibit the growth of strains that are resistant to phenylamides, strobilurin, dimethomorph and <b>iprovalicarb.</b> It has some systemic activity as it moves through the xylem towards the tips of stems, but does not get transported to the roots. It affects the motility of zoospores, the germination of cysts, {{the growth of the}} mycelium and sporulation. Bayer CropScience developed the compound and it was first released as a commercial product in 2006.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Melody Duo 66. 75 wp was assayed on pearl millet downy mildew (PMDM). This novel fungicide, a {{combined}} preparation of <b>iprovalicarb</b> and propineb, controlled all developmental stages of Sclerospora graminicola. The protective {{effect of this}} preparation was due to <b>iprovalicarb</b> and was equipotent to metalaxyl-containing Apron 35 sd and Ridomil 72 MZ wp, whereas the eradicant activity of Melody Duo exceeded that of the two latters at comparative doses. <b>Iprovalicarb</b> was translocated acropetally and exhibited systemically an excellent curative activity. The downy mildewed pearl millet plants recovered after foliar treatments with the preparations. The exploitation of Melody Duo 66. 75 wp is recommended against pearl millet downy mildew disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} in {{field and the}} transfer from grapes to wine during winemaking of <b>iprovalicarb,</b> indoxacarb, and boscalid was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for <b>iprovalicarb,</b> indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The GC–ITMS method showed good performance with adequate recoveries ranging from 75 to 115 %, and good method limits of quantitation (LOQs) and of determination (LODs) far below MRLs...|$|E
40|$|The {{risk that}} the plant {{pathogen}} Phytophthora melonis develops resistance to carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides was determined by measuring baseline sensitivities of field isolates, generating resistant mutants, and measuring the fitness of the resistant mutants. The baseline sensitivities of 80 isolates to flumorph, dimethomorph and <b>iprovalicarb</b> were described by unimodal curves, with mean EC 50 values of 0. 986 (60. 245), 0. 284 (60. 060) and 0. 327 (60. 068) mg/ml, respectively. Seven isolates with different genetic background (as indicated by RAPD markers) were selected to generate CAA-resistance. Fifty-five resistant mutants were obtained from three out of seven isolates by spontaneous selection and UV-mutagenesis with frequencies of 161027 and 161026, respectively. CAA-resistance was stable for all mutants. The resistance factors of these mutants ranged from 7 to 601. The compound fitness index (CFI = mycelial growth 6 zoospore production 6 pathogenicity) was often lower for the CAA-resistant isolates than for wild-type isolates, suggesting {{that the risk of}} P. melonis developing resistance to CAA fungicides is low to moderate. Among the CAA-resistant isolates, a negative correlation between EC 50 values was found for <b>iprovalicarb</b> vs. flumorph and for <b>iprovalicarb</b> vs. dimethomorph. Comparison of the full-length cellulose synthase 3 (CesA 3) between wild-type and CAA-resistant isolates revealed only one point mutation at codon position 1109 : a valine residue (codon GTG in wild-type isolates) was converted to leucine (codon CTG in resistant mutants). This represents a novel point mutation with respect to mutations in CesA 3 conferring resistance to CA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, famoxadone fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, <b>iprovalicarb,</b> fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of <b>iprovalicarb,</b> indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for <b>iprovalicarb,</b> indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, <b>iprovalicarb,</b> penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E

40|$|The direct {{application}} of plant protective agents into tree xylem is an ecologically sound method of plant protection, {{which has already}} been used for trees in ur-ban environements. In order to make this system viable for grapevines (Vitis), {{the effectiveness of the}} protective system must be ensured. In the first experiment, the effect of the fungicide agents dimethomorph, fosetyl-al, <b>iprovalicarb</b> and met-alaxyl applied to the stem of field-grown grapevines was investigated. As a result, injection experiments using non-formulated metalaxyl showed the desired protec-tive effects against downy mildew (Plasmopora viticola). In the second experiment, non-formulated metalaxyl was applied several times in succession {{over a period of several}} weeks to the xylem of test grapevines using an injection system, affixed long-term to the vine stems. Grapevines sprayed with formulated metalaxyl (Fon-ganil Gold®) enabled the methods to be compared.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was carried out}} to test the efﬁciency of a bio-mixture made up of pruning residues at two (PR 2) and ﬁve (PR 5) years of composting and wheat straw (STW) in the biological cleaning of water contaminated by different mixtures of fungicides usually employed in vineyards. The experiment was conducted and reproduced at a scale of 1 : 100 of operating ﬁeld conditions. Commer- cial formulates of penconazole (PC), (RS) - 1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) pentyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole), dimetomorph (DM), (EZ) - 4 -[3 -(4 - chlorophenyl) - 3 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) acryloyl]morpholine), azoxystrobin (AZ), (methyl (E) - 2 - 2 -[6 -(2 -cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin- 4 -yloxy]phenyl - 3 -methoxyacrylate), <b>iprovalicarb</b> (IP), (isopropyl 2 -methyl- 1 -[(RS) - 1 -p-tolylethyl]carbamoyl-(S) -propylcarbamate), metalaxyl (MX), (methyl N-(methoxyacetyl) -N-(2, 6 -xylyl) -DL-alaninate), ﬂudioxonil (FL), (4 -(2, 2 -diﬂuoro- 1, 3 -benzodioxol- 4 -yl) - 1 H-pyrrole- 3 -carbonitrile) and cyprodinil (CY), (4 -cyclopropyl- 6 -methyl-N-phenylpyrimidin- 2 -amine) were mixed in water and dis- charged into the bio-mixture following the time schedule of the treatments {{carried out in the}} grapevine in real ﬁeld conditions.

40|$|Many oomycetes {{species are}} {{pathogens}} of plants, animals and humans; {{some of them}} are well studied because they cause significant economic losses in agriculture and acquaculture. The cell wall of oomycetes consists mainly of cellulose, β- (1, 3) and β- (1, 6) - glucan and in some species a small amount of chitin is also present. The biosynthesis of cellulose in oomycetes is still poorly studied and therefore misunderstood, although it’s the target of some fungicides that inhibit this process, such as carboxylic acid amides. Since 2010, single amino acid exchanges in CesA 3 protein conferring CAA resistance in Plasmopara viticola have been identified. In this work, we initially provide the first evidence of the presence of mandipropamid resistant populations of Plasmopara viticola in commercial vineyards in Italy (paper I). We continue by studying the different activity of four CAAs fungicides (benthiavalicarb, dimethomorph, <b>iprovalicarb,</b> mandipropamid) toward P. viticola resistant strains (paper II). The results show that the G 1105 S mutation affects all four CAAs, but its impact is varied. These results confirm that they are cross resistant, although many gaps in the mode of action are still present. In order to confirm our previous findings, we performed a microscopical base method to assess the sensitivity of four CAAs, and preliminary microscopical data confirmed the different activity toward the CAA-resistant and CAA-sensitive populations (chapter ten). Furthermore, we present a study (chapter eleven) in which we randomly selected samples from paper I, in order to test them using a different approach, simulating a scenario more close to the field. With this test, we were able to confirm the data presented in the paper I...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall-induced {{peaks in}} {{pesticide}} concentrations can occur rapidly. Low frequency sampling may therefore largely underestimate maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes. Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2  min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, <b>Iprovalicarb,</b> Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387  μg L−  1. Samples {{from all of}} the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0. 1  μg L−  1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013 / 39 /EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25 %). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30 - or 4 -fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52 %), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport...|$|E
