5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} in {{the earliest}} divisions of the egg {{appears to be the}} original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, {{in the earliest}} Ecdysozoa and possibly in the earliest Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} {{additional}} {{species have been}} assigned to the genus Daspletosaurus over the years, although as of 2007 none of these species have received a proper description or scientific name. In the meantime, all are designated as Daspletosaurus spp; this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> they all are the same species.|$|E
5000|$|The terms [...] "endemic" [...] and [...] "indigenous" [...] <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> an {{organism}} necessarily originated or evolved {{where it is}} found.|$|R

25|$|Such {{explanations}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> {{humans are}} always consciously calculating how {{to increase their}} inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E
2500|$|Elves {{who stayed}} in Middle-earth and {{never saw the}} light of the trees became known as the Moriquendi or [...] "Dark-elves". This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the Dark-elves were evil, they just never saw {{the light of the}} trees.|$|R
5000|$|Once clocks are {{synchronised}} one {{can measure}} the one-way light speed.

50|$|The above {{illustrations}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> melharmony {{is limited}} in scope. Quite the converse since there are diverse harmonic options in many ragas which can be explored and employed appropriately. Similar melharmonic options can be created for any highly evolved melodic system.|$|R
5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production {{and a higher}} material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people {{that contributed to the}} Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
5|$|Verified status <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> Twitter {{continuously}} checks {{whether such}} accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users {{have tried to}} impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone {{to apply for a}} verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
2500|$|The ASA {{noted that}} Rawlins' quote {{referred}} {{to the use of}} animal testing in [...] "long-term carcinogenicity studies with known genotoxic compounds or compounds that produced hyperplasia in chronic toxicity tests only," [...] and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> he was against all animal testing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Honora, {{looking at}} a tall, thin woman of middle age who wore a tiara, and whose throat was covered with jewels. Honora <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Grenfell's name, {{and most of those}} that followed, were {{extremely}} familiar to her.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that the}} coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form by different process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research since the early 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|R
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes {{with the end of}} Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E

25|$|So far no {{evidence}} of air sacs {{has been found in}} ornithischian dinosaurs. But this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.|$|E
25|$|The Nevi'im, {{the books}} of the Prophets, are {{considered}} divine and true.

While one {{standard}} deviation is 15 points, and two SDs are 30 points, and so on, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> mental ability is linearly related to IQ, such that IQ 50 means half the cognitive ability of IQ 100. In particular, IQ points are not percentage points.|$|E
25|$|Measurement {{errors in}} {{physical}} experiments are often modeled by a normal distribution. This {{use of a}} normal distribution <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> one is assuming the measurement errors are normally distributed, rather using the normal distribution produces the most conservative predictions possible given only knowledge about the mean and variance of the errors.|$|E
