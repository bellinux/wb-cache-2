50|$|The Kimball Public Library stands {{north of}} Randolph's {{commercial}} downtown, {{on the east}} side of Main Street, next door to the Chandler Music Hall. It is a single-story masonry structure, set on a sloping lot that exposes a full basement to the rear. The foundation is rusticated granite, and the main structure is faced in brick with sandstone trim. The building is capped by gabled roof with a dome at its center. The main facade is symmetrical, with a tall projecting gabled section at the center, sheltering the main entrance under a large Romanesque rounded arch. This section is flanked on either side by banks of three sash windows, each topped by stained-glass transoms.

40|$|The {{glass furnace}} sieges and the {{structures}} associated with annealing furnace flue of the Bolsterstone Glass House, Stocksbridge, Sheffield (φ= 53. 47 °, λ= - 1. 59 °), have been dated using archaeomagnetic techniques. The lintels over the annealing furnace flue, {{were found to}} have not been heated sufficiently to reset the magnetisation, but nine samples from the footing of the main arch structure were significantly heated. These produced a direction (corrected to Meriden) of declination= 338. 2 o, inclination= 70. 9 ° (α 95 = 1. 8 °, K= 326). This indicates that the best estimated date for the last heating of this structure is AD 1840 (95 % confidence interval – AD 1800 – 1870). This date may accord with the later time of use of the structure for pottery production. Samples from the remains of the glass furnace sieges, and the possible glass <b>moulding</b> <b>floor</b> (ie, silica-rich samples containing glass) were collected from an excavated pit inside the present building. Three silica-rich samples and seven reddened sandstones together produced a mean direction (corrected to Meriden) of declination= 349. 7 °, inclination= 73. 5 ° (α 95 = 1. 5 °, K= 347). This suggests that the best estimated date for the last heating of the sieges and use of the <b>moulding</b> <b>floor</b> is AD 1710 (95 % confidence interval – AD 1680 – 1730) ...|$|R

This building, like the majority of the others has certain signature elements reminiscent of Russell Warren's work, most notably the cantilevered [...] "flying staircase", <b>floor</b> plan and <b>moulding</b> details. The high quality of design and workmanship may be attributable to Russell Warren, a prominent Rhode Island architect and proponent of the Greek Revival. The high architectural quality, the relative scarcity of buildings of this age and type, and their association with figures important in the industrial and commercial development of Fall River.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} of the {{building}} was designed for use as staff offices and facilities. The two stairways providing access to the upper floor are found at the western and eastern ends of the floor. The eastern stair is a narrow dog-leg timber stairs on a steel frame which dates from about the mid-20th century. The western stair is an earlier timber dog leg stair. The central first floor hallway provides access {{to a number of}} large, well lit office spaces. Natural lighting from the windows lining the building is supplemented on both the northern and southern sides with a series of skylights, which though probably not original are certainly an early development of the building and reflect the use of the rooms as offices. The partitioning on the upper floor is constructed with lath and plaster walls and the ceilings are also lath and plaster. The upper floor has more decorative finishes than the lower <b>floor</b> with <b>moulded</b> archways along the hall, and cornices and skirting boards of various sizes in the halls and rooms. Early paint schemes are evident in many places of the upper floor.|$|R
50|$|When the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse first opened, it {{provided}} space primarily for just those two operations. The post office occupied {{the first floor}} with the public lobby oriented east to west all along the south wall, and with the workroom {{to the north of}} the lobby. The money registry was located at the east end of the lobby, the stair wrapping around the elevator cage was at the west end. There was a short lobby extension from the stair northward to provide additional postal windows and give access to the postmaster's office at the northwest corner of the floor. A vault was placed at each end of the floor, one for the money registry and one for the postmaster. There was also a single occupancy toilet at each end of the floor. The mailing vestibule occupied the center position of the postal workroom's north wall. Although it was a construction alternate, the lobby was finished with light colored terrazzo with marble divisions and borders at the floor and wall base. The walls had stained wood wainscoting, postal windows, grills, and door casings with painted plaster above. The interior entry vestibule (center door pair only) was constructed of stained wood and glass and had two wood and glass doors. The ceiling of the lobby had ornamental plaster crown mouldings. The main stairway was constructed with grey marble treads and iron railings, stringers and risers. The original traction elevator had a steel grill enclosure and metal hoist way entrance doors with wire glass relights. The postal lobby finishes were duplicated on the second and third floor lobbies (also a construction alternate) except for the ornamental ceiling plaster. Upper lobbies were centered axially on the stair and elevator which allowed a row of offices along the south wall. The courtroom space occupied the north side of the lobby and extended through the third floor. This courtroom was finished modestly with wall coverings, smooth painted plaster, and stained wood mouldings and furnishings. A construction alternate for the courtroom was designed and shown on the bid drawings, but not built. That design was built at the federal courthouse in Pendleton, Oregon, a very similar building that was constructed concurrently. Office areas on the upper two levels typically were finished with wood <b>floors,</b> <b>moulded</b> wood base, chair rail and casings, three panel wood doors, and smooth painted plaster walls and ceilings. The stained wood corridor doors were typically half-light (art glass) over two panels and had transoms.|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{design and}} product qualities {{are most effective}} {{in the growth of}} the precast industry. Zeolite concrete is one of the factors, which will contribute m improving the quality of many precast structural elements such as walls, beams, etc. This thesis is in two parts. The first part presents a study of fresh concrete properties, which are water content, slump, strength and cost of product. Tests were undertaken in four groups of concrete adopted. The first group (B) was of a standard mix proportion of 30 MPa. The second group (F) had partial replacement of cement with fly ash. The third group (S) had partial replacement of sand with granulated blast-furnace slag in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from group (F). The fourth group (Z) had partial replacement of coarse aggregate (blue metal) with zeolite in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from groups (F) and (S) to evaluate the effective of adding zeolite in fly-ash-slag concrete. Zeolite in concrete is seen to improve the freshness (workability) and hardness (strength) properties of the fly-ash-slag concrete. The second part of the thesis considers a particular connection. Connections are most important for precast structural elements. This thesis presents a study of strength and deformation behaviour of floor-wall connections in precast reinforced concrete walls in a plant building. Three half-scale walls and <b>floors</b> <b>moulds</b> were designed, built and tested in the structural laboratory to evaluate the deflection, strain and stress behaviour of steel connections, fixing bolts, walls and floor edge beams. The design of the walls was based on the structural analysis of precast concrete walls of a one storey plant typical of a commercial building. The load analysis and design of the concrete walls, steel reinforcement, steel connection and fixing bolts, their configuration and manufacturing were according to Australian standard recommendations. The three tests undertaken had different types of concrete strength. The first two walls had different types of reinforcing steel and different steel connections. The third wall, adopted after the first and second walls were tested and evaluated, allowed reasonable evaluation of the deformation behaviour. The load-deflection and strain curves of wall, floor, connection and fixing bolts were compared between the laboratory tests and the computer analysis using Strand 6 program. Also the rotation of the floor slab when failure occurred was evaluated to determine its effect on the behavior of the connection and the wall. The connections and walls demonstrated satisfactory moment resistance and shear capacities. The test results confirmed that this connection and fixing bolts would give satisfactory load capacity and ductility performance, and that they can safely carry the applicable loads [...] The connection can be safely applied to precast reinforced concrete elements in a commercial building. The crack behaviour for the three walls was studied, and conclusions were made, based on the test results and the analysis of computer results. Recommendations for future work are also given...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{knowledge}} {{alone would}} not usually prepare an educated {{person for the}} world of work. A productive individual must not only be knowledgeable in theory but must also be versatile {{in the application of}} skills to perform defined jobs or work, hence the need for Students’ Work Experience Program (SWEP). The 2012 / 2013 Students’ Work Experience Programme (SWEP) was undertaken at Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria (ABUAD) by all 200 and 300 Level engineering students. The Students’ Work Experience Programme (SWEP) helps develop in the students, a logical mode of thinking and reasoning that promotes a practical application of acquired theoretical, knowledge in overcoming technical and professional challenges. Besides it also helps in training the students on how to acknowledge and appreciate the numerous professional challenges of their immediate environment and the society at large and offer solutions, which their knowledge empowerment avails them. The SWEP featured activities in three key Engineering fields namely: Mechanical, Electrical and Civil. The Civil Project include: moulding of interlocking tiles, terrazzo floor making, participation in on-going construction works on campus, sewage system etc. During the SWEP, students were resourcefully engaged in terrazzo <b>flooring</b> and <b>moulding</b> of interlocking tiles as well as other various engineering activities within the school.

40|$|Reproductive {{efficiency}} {{is an essential}} requirement for the profitability of swine farms {{and the quality of}} fodder can {{have a negative impact on}} this aspect. We carried out investigations regarding the influence of fodder quality on reproductive efficiency and the histological structure of the ovary and oviduct in 45 sows from a farm in Bihor county. We observed that corn utilized in feeding the sows was stored in inadequate conditions which allowed the development of moulds. The combined fodder, resulted after grinding the cereals, was stored directly on the concrete floor in inappropriate areas, concerning the hygiene. The animals were given green fodder directly on the stallâ€™s <b>floor,</b> which favours <b>mould</b> expansion. Upon histological examination, the ovary presented an exaggerated activity and there was a marked congestion in the oviduct, with a tendency of the epithelium toward pseudostratification. The precarious conditions of cereal and combined fodder storing and administration of green fodder, brought optimum conditions for mould development. Under the action of the latter factors, the reproductive performance drastically decreased along with compromising the sows used for reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{water damage}} in {{buildings}} because of leaking pipes and increasingly because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for improved repair and remediation techniques {{have to be}} developed. The water damage in buildings because of leaking pipes and increasingly because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for improved repair and remediation techniques have to be developed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Therefore, large scale laboratory tests with four rooms, each with three types of masonry walls and typical floors for intermediate storeys with insulation were performed within a climate simulator. Artificial water damage was provoked through watering the floors, and the dispersion {{of water in the}} floors and the rising damp in the walls was measured. In the follow-up to the watering of the floors, a company specialized in drying wet buildings, installed systems for under floor drying and wall drying. Findings The drying process of the different components and layers of the floor construction and walls was monitored by a measuring system with more than 300 sensors for moisture content, relative humidity and temperature accompanied by thermography and demonstrated so {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different tested drying systems. After providing an initial contamination that is typical for construction sites, the microbial load (mould infestation) within the wet components was monitored at different times by experienced biologists. So after three weeks under <b>floor</b> drying no <b>mould</b> growth could be asserted but more bacteria than expected were found. Originality/value The aim of the research was to gain more confidence in selecting appropriate drying procedures and systems in order to identify the right moment for terminating the drying process.

40|$|This Thesis {{is focused}} on the study of the problem of {{condensation}} on the inner surface of Fullrigaren building’s large single pane window. This has serious consequences as water on the <b>floor,</b> corrosion or <b>mould</b> growth. As the climate in Nordic countries is cold for several months a year, windows are a crucial part in building envelopes. Condensation on a window may be suitably discussed only with respect to the climate considered as cold, moderate and warm climates pose different requirements on the windows, and this is why a characterization of Gävle by its climate is necessary. This Thesis will include the energy analysis of the staircase considered which is required to understand the source of the actual problem. Both heat and moisture transfer will be studied. In this purpose, an IDA model will be built to simulate the conditions throughout the year and hand-made calculations will be done for the average and most critical situations. The results show that condensation will already occur for the monthlyaverage conditions having as an additional problem that if temperature drops below zero it will freeze. Results will also be compared to an initial installation of a 2 pane window reaching as a conclusion that its original installation would had avoided the problems for most of the time. The Thesis will end with several proposals posed to solve the problem by either increasing the temperature or reducing the moisture content of the ambient air, and the selection of the best one. The final aim of the Thesis is to achieve an energy efficient window which should provide good lighting during the day and good thermal comfort both during day and night at minimum demand of paid energy. And for this, the selection of the electrically heated window is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a study which has been carried out on a timber floor {{construction}} above a ground-supported concrete slab, which was used in small detached houses built in Sweden during the period 1960 - 1990. This method of building has turned out to be a risky construction nowadays, but there are 800, 000 houses built this way in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – By using the patented Air Gap Method inside building constructions, harmful water can be dried out. The method ventilates air gaps inside walls and floors with an air flow driven by thermal buoyancy caused by a heating cable in the vertical air gaps. The drying out process has been studied both by measuring the moisture level in the slab and also by measuring the humidity transport and comparing this with air flow measurements. Findings – The paper shows that the Air Gap Method manages to dry out water from both the slab and the overlaying wooden construction. The study shows also that the relative humidity (RH) levels in the air space below the floor are reduced in a significant way, thus minimizing mould growth. It is also shown that a thin layer of concrete upon <b>floor</b> beams prevents <b>mould</b> to grow even in a humid situation. Research limitations/implications – The research reported in this paper is only concerned with timber-framed small detached houses. Similar studies of apartment buildings are ongoing. Practical implications – The Air Gap Method can thus be useful in the context of renovating a water damaged house of this type built during this 30 -year period. The method provides a possibility of drying out such damage without a separate drying period. The inhabitants could therefore be able to use a renovated water-damaged kitchen six/eight weeks earlier compared to ordinary building methods. Originality/value – The paper is useful because it provides better understanding of the mechanism of RH inside a building construction and how this parameter could be lowered. The paper is also useful in the context of renovating water-damaged small detached houses built by the risky method of construction used in the last decades of the twentieth century.
