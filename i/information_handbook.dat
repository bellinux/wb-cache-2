It is important for clinicians to make accurate, timely, safe and effective decisions with regards to {{drug use in the}} patient. ObjectiveTo provide clinicians with an oncology-specific drug interaction database that is relevant to their daily practice. This database focuses on DDIs with anticancer drugs (ACDs), single- and multiple-agent chemotherapy regimens. MethodsDrug-related and interaction-related information between anticancer and antiepileptic drugs were compiled from drug <b>information</b> <b>handbooks</b> and databases, package inserts, and published literature from PubMed. Web documents were served from a modified web server with a database engine and programming interface constructed using Adobe software and various programming scripts. ResultsOncoRx is an oncology-specific database whose structure is designed around chemotherapy regimens and generic drug names used in anticancer treatment. OncoRx currently comprises of 117 ACDs and 256 single-agent and combination chemotherapy regimens. It covers all the major classes of ACDs and their frequently prescribed chemotherapy regimens, and can detect up to over 2000 interactions with 24 antiepileptic drugs. Data provided to clinicians include pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs, information regarding the chemotherapy regimens and the detected DDIs. ConclusionOncoRx is able to identify DDIs between ACDs and adjuvant drug therapy. This is the first database of its kind to be able to detect interactions for combination chemotherapy regimens.

While attention {{has focused on the}} etiology and treatment of patients with end stage renal disease, little consideration has been given to the educational preparation of patients for adjustment to their illness, compliance with diet and medication, and re-entry into society. An assessment of appropriate and current patient education materials was conducted. This assessment consisted of a thorough review of existing materials along with ongoing exchange of information with medical professionals and patients in Southern California. An <b>information</b> <b>handbook</b> content needs assessment was conducted by the Investigator. The content needs assessment consisted of the review of existing patient education materials along with discussion and incorporation of suggestions made by patients and medical professionals. The results of the content needs assessment revealed four major areas of education and information designed to increase the self-care management of the patient. The four major areas included: information on kidney function, diseases, and failure, and specific information on the alternative treatment modalities; basic information on diet and medication; preventive measures, or the importance of compliance, to prevent complications of end stage renal disease and the selected treatment; and the psychosocial factors of end stage renal disease for the patient and family to include information on adjustment and available resources.

40|$|Concomitant use of anticancer drugs (ACDs) and {{antidepressants}} (ADs) in {{the treatment}} of depression in patients with cancer may result in potentially harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). It is crucial that clinicians make timely, accurate, safe and effective decisions regarding drug therapies in patients. The ubiquitous nature of the internet or “cloud” has enabled easy dissemination of DDI information, but there is currently no database dedicated to allow searching of ACD interactions by chemotherapy regimens. We describe the implementation of an AD interaction module to a previously published oncology-specific DDI database for clinicians which focuses on ACDs, single-agent and multiple-agent chemotherapy regimens. Methods. Drug- and DDI-related information were collated from drug <b>information</b> <b>handbooks,</b> databases, package inserts, and published literature from PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct. Web documents were constructed using Adobe software and programming scripts, and mounted on a domain served from the internet cloud. Results. OncoRx is an oncology-specific DDI database whose structure is designed around all the major classes of ACDs and their frequently prescribed chemotherapy regimens. There are 117 ACDs and 256 regimens in OncoRx, and it can detect over 1 500 interactions with 21 ADs. Clinicians are provided with the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs, information on the regimens and details of the detected DDIs during an interaction search. Conclusion. OncoRx is the first database of its kind which allows detection of ACD and chemotherapy regimen interactions with ADs. This tool will assist clinicians in improving clinical response and reducing adverse effects based on the therapeutic and toxicity profiles of the drugs. Read More: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{interactions}} are commonly {{seen in the}} treatment of cancer patients. Psychotropics are often indicated for these patients since they may also suffer from pre-existing psychological disorders or experience insomnia and anxiety associated with cancer therapy. Thus, the risk of anticancer drug (ACD) -psychotropic drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is high. Drug interactions were compiled from the British National Formulary (53 rd edn), Lexi-Comp's Drug <b>Information</b> <b>Handbook</b> (15 th edn), Micromedex® (v 5. 1), Hansten & Horn's Drug Interactions (2000) and Drug Interaction Facts (2008 edn). Product information of the individual drugs, as well as documented literature on ACD-psychotropic interactions from PubMed and other databases was also incorporated. This paper identifies clinically important ACD-psychotropic DDIs that are frequently observed. Pharmacokinetic DDIs were observed for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids and antimicrotubule agents due to their inhibitory or inductive effects on cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes. Pharmacodynamic DDIs were identified for thalidomide with central nervous system depressants, procarbazine with antidepressants, myelosuppressive ACDs with clozapine and anthracyclines with QT-prolonging psychotropics. Clinicians should be vigilant when psychotropics are prescribed concurrently with ACDs. Close monitoring of plasma drug levels should be carried out to avoid toxicity in the patient, as well as to ensure adequate chemotherapeutic and psychotropic coverage...|$|E
