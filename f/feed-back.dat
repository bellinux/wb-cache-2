25|$|If a {{group of}} neurons engages in {{synchronized}} oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator. Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form <b>feed-back</b> loops that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures. Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.|$|E
25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a <b>feed-back</b> regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other's and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVirtual {{surgical}} simulators face many computational challenges: {{they need}} to provide biophysical accuracy, realistic <b>feed-backs</b> and high-rate responses. Better biophysical accuracy and more realistic <b>feed-backs</b> (be they visual, haptic [...] .) induce more computational footprint. State-of-the-art approaches use high-performance hardware or find an acceptable trade-off between performance and accuracy to deliver interactive yet pedagogically relevant simulators. In this paper, we propose an interactive vascular neurosurgery simulator that provides bi-manual interaction with haptic feedback. The simulator is an original combination of states-of-the-art techniques that allows visual realism, bio-physical realism, complex interactions with the anatomical structures and the instruments and haptic feedback. Training exercises are also proposed to learn and to perform the different steps of intracranial aneurysm surgery (IAS). We assess the performance of our simulator with quantitative performance benchmarks and qualitative assessments of junior and senior clinicians...|$|R

These findings are important in deciphering the <b>feed-backs</b> between tectonics and surface processes.
