5|$|She and Charles had six {{children}} together. Before {{her first child}} Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she sewed for him was like a funeral shroud, and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1932, Holden was {{travelling}} as {{a passenger}} aboard a New England Airways DH.80 Puss Moth from Sydney to Brisbane when it crashed at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue and the <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> of the Canberra, Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations {{determined that the}} Puss Moth, VH-UPM, had gone down {{as a result of}} wing failure caused by aileron flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at Rookwood Cemetery, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass window at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E

25|$|NRK, the TV 2 Group and Telenor {{started in}} 2001 {{negotiating}} establishing a {{digital terrestrial television}} network. Telenor withdrew and NRK and TV 2 established Norges Televisjon in 2002. The government invited to a tender for a concession for a DVB-T network in 2002. Norkring estimated in 2003 that it would cost NOK1 billion in investments {{over a period of}} 15 years to keep the analog television network running, which would limit transmission to four channels. NTV was the only applicant for the concession, but the tender was re-issued in 2005, after NTV wanted to extend its duration from 12 to 15 years. In the second tender, Telenor also applied. Thus the two companies agreed to collaborate and Telenor was invited as a <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> of NTV, which in the end was the only applicant.|$|E
25|$|Phar Lap at {{the time}} was owned by American {{businessman}} David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.|$|E

He {{was a member of a}} pious Roman Catholic family from Espalion in the département of Aveyron. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc's view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father's family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother's. The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as [...] "half monk and half naughty boy".|$|E

500|$|The Anderson family {{supported}} slavery, {{although they}} did not own slaves; however, their move to Kansas was likely for economic rather than political reasons. At that time there was significant debate about slavery in Kansas, and many residents of the northern US had moved there {{to ensure that it}} would not become a slave state. Animosity soon developed between these immigrants and Confederate sympathizers, but there was little unrest in the Council Grove area. After settling near Council Grove, the family became friends with A.I. Baker, a local judge who was a Confederate sympathizer. By 1860 William T. Anderson was a <b>joint</b> <b>owner</b> of a [...] property that was worth $500 and his family had a net worth of around $1,000.
