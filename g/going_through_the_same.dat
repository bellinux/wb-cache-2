Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing.|$|E

2500|$|For Legend, {{the control}} scheme and {{character}} movement was redesigned {{to provide a}} smooth and fluid experience. One of the key elements present was how buttons for different actions cleanly transitioned into different actions, along with these moves being incorporated into combat to create effects such as stunning or knocking down enemies. Quick-time events were also added into certain segments within each level, {{and many of the}} puzzles were based around sophisticated in-game physics. Anniversary, while <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> locals of the original game, was rebuilt using the gameplay and environmental puzzles of Legend. For Underworld, the gameplay was redesigned around a phrase the staff had put to themselves: [...] "What Could Lara Do?". Using this set-up, they created a greater variety of moves and greater interaction with the environment, along with expanding and improving combat. The gameplay underwent another major change for the 2013 reboot. Gameplay altered from progression through linear levels to navigating an open world, with hunting for supplies and upgrading equipment and weapons becoming a key part of gameplay. The combat was redesigned to be similar to the Uncharted series: the previous reticle-based lock-on mechanics were replaced by a free-roaming aim. Rise of the Tomb Raider built on the reboot's foundation, adding dynamic weather systems, and reintroducing swimming.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to determine the senses of words in queries by using WordNet. In our approach, noun phrases in a query are determined first. For each word in the query, information associated with it, including its synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, definitions of its synonyms and hyponyms, and its domains, can be used for word sense disambiguation. By comparing these pieces of information associated with the words which form a phrase, {{it may be possible to}} assign senses to these words. If the above disambiguation fails, then other query words, if exist, are used, by <b>going</b> <b>through</b> exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> process. If <b>the</b> sense of a query word cannot be determined in this manner, then a guess of the sense of the word is made, if the guess has at least 50 % chance of being correct. If no sense of the word has 50 % or higher chance of being used, then we apply a Web search to assist in the word sense disambiguation process. Experimental results show that our approach has 100 % applicability and 90 % accuracy on the most recent robust track of TREC collection of 250 queries. We combine this disambiguation algorithm to our retrieval system to examine the effect of word sense disambiguation in text retrieval. Experimental results show that the disambiguation algorithm together with other components of our retrieval system yield a result which is 13. 7 % above that produced by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> system but without the disambiguation, and 9. 2 % above that produced by using Lesk’s algorithm. Our retrieval effectiveness is 7 % better than the best reported result in the literature...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explores the}} roles and {{meanings}} of the Internet, which is commonly used in this age group, {{as a source of}} support for people with fertility problems. METHODS: A qualitative interview study with 27 women and 11 men who had been, or were <b>going,</b> <b>through</b> treatment for infertility. A maximum variation sample was sought. Narrative interviews were conducted and transcribed for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women and men with fertility problems often feel isolated. The Internet offers anonymity, emotional support, normalisation and reassurance. It also offers the prospect of niche support from others <b>going</b> <b>through</b> treatments at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time and in similar circumstances. Online infertility networks can play a valuable role in helping people deal with the emotional stresses and isolation they feel during and after treatment, but has the potential to reinforce isolation. CONCLUSIONS: The Internet is changing people's experience of infertility, giving people access to other's experiences. Internet communication is highly valued by couples, especially those isolated in their real world relationships. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians can help by referring couples to websites while being aware that increasingly 'niche' support could compound isolation...|$|R

60|$|There is {{only one}} way in which the author can protect himself; and that is by making a version of his own and <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> legal farce with it. But the legal farce {{involves}} the hire of a hall and the payment of a fee of two guineas to the King's Reader of Plays. When I wrote Cashel Byron's Profession I had no guineas to spare, a common disability of young authors. What is equally common, I did not know the law. A reasonable man may guess a reasonable law, but no man can guess a foolish anomaly. Fortunately, by the time my book so suddenly revived in America I was aware of the danger, and in a position to protect myself by writing and performing The Admirable Bashville. The prudence of doing so was soon demonstrated; for rumors soon reached me of several American stage versions; and one of these has actually been played in New York, with the boxing scenes under the management (so it is stated) of the eminent pugilist Mr. James J. Corbett. The New York press, in a somewhat derisive vein, conveyed the impression that in this version Cashel Byron sought to interest the public rather as the last of the noble race of the Byrons of Dorsetshire than as his unromantic self; but in justice to a play which I never read, and an actor whom I never saw, and who honorably offered to treat me as if I had legal rights in the matter, I must not accept the newspaper evidence as conclusive.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. Yet observe, I do {{not mean}} to speak of the body and soul as separable. The man is made up of both: they are to be raised and glorified together, and all art is an {{expression}} of the one, by and through the other. All that I would insist upon is, the necessity of the whole man being in his work; the body must be in it. Hands and habits must be in it, whether we will or not; but the nobler part of the man may often not be in it. And that nobler part acts principally in love, reverence, and admiration, together with those conditions of thought which arise out of them. For we usually fall into much error by considering the intellectual powers as having dignity in themselves, and separable from the heart; whereas the truth is, that the intellect becomes noble and ignoble according to the food we give it, and the kind of subjects with which it is conversant. It is not the reasoning power which, of itself, is noble, but the reasoning power occupied with its proper objects. Half of the mistakes of metaphysicians have arisen from their not observing this; namely, that the intellect, <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> processes, is yet mean or noble according to the matter it deals with, and wastes itself away in mere rotatory motion, if it be set to grind straws and dust. If we reason only respecting words, or lines, or any trifling and finite things, the reason becomes a contemptible faculty; but reason employed on holy and infinite things, becomes herself holy and infinite. So that, by work of the soul, I mean the reader always to understand the work of the entire immortal creature, proceeding from a quick, perceptive, and eager heart, perfected by the intellect, and finally dealt with by the hands, under the direct guidance of these higher powers.|$|E
40|$|Field sensitivities of {{the three}} IIj (j = 3, 4, 5) {{mechanisms}} of Stiles were measured for monochromatic backgrounds of different wave numbers (mu) - 1 traversing <b>the</b> eye <b>through</b> different points (r) displaced along a horizontal chord <b>through</b> <b>the</b> centre of the entrance pupil. Each mechanism shows an insensitivity to the direction of retinal incidence of short-wave backgrounds not previously described. The spectral densities of the centre-most part of the lens and of the macular pigment were measured on this eye. With reasonable assumptions the former allowed for correction at the receptor level of the directional sensitivity; together with the latter it allowed correction for the spectral sensitivity as well. No correction for the attenuation of the high spatial frequencies of the background as it traversed the pupil at different r was needed. The anomalies of section 2 (above) disappear after correction for losses in the eye media. After these corrections, for every mu and r, the results are well described by the parabola 'tentatively' suggested by Stiles (1939) for each mechanism, allowing {{only a small amount}} of variance attributable to experimental imprecision alone. Each mechanism is most sensitive to backgrounds <b>going</b> <b>through</b> essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> point of <b>the</b> pupil, independent of background. This result is inconsistent with a qualitative explanation of the 'hue shift' suggested by Safir, Hyams & Philpot (1971).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{elucidate}} different aspects of Swedish adolescents’ use of alcohol and drugs and how society deals with problems related to their use. The subject has been analyzed in four studies. The first study was based on focus-group interviews with adolescents and aimed at elucidating the meaning of alcohol and intoxication for adolescents. The participants’ discussions contained two levels - one superficial (an ideal presentation of themselves) and one deep (which mediated cultural ideas of how to think and act). This is interpreted {{as a way to}} express the maturity process they are <b>going</b> <b>through,</b> at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as it symbolizes difficulties to unite external norms and values with their own need for devotion. The second study was based on project applications, evaluations and economy accounts for preventive work from 150 projects conducted by non-profit organizations. The results show that type of organizations and the methods used were based on tradition rather than on efficiency. These results are discussed in relation to growing demands for evidence based practice in the field of prevention. The third and the fourth study are based on the ADAD-interview (Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis). In the third study, comparisons of different judgements concerning the extent of drug abuse among adolescents in institutional care, were made and results show large differences between the different judgements, concerning both occurrence and extent of abuse. In the fourth study, the significance of ADAD was discussed in relation to matching drug abusing adolescents to treatment institutions. The results show that {{only a limited number of}} institutions specializes on drug abusing adolescents and that a majority of the adolescents institutionalized for drug problems never visit an institution specialized on drug abuse treatment...|$|R
40|$|While {{songs with}} {{distinct}} Chinese characteristics, whether musically or lyrically, {{have always been}} part of local pop history, "China Wind" (zhongguofeng) is a novel phenomenon. Above all, China Wind owes its production and circulation as a discursive formation to its endorsement by mainstream artists, notably from Taiwan, as much as to its popularity among audiences in Greater China. While China Wind pop is yet to be systematically documented, researched and analyzed, popular and media attention has generally focused on Taiwan-based artists and lyrics. In this essay, rather than focusing on what is considered the main source of China Wind songs, namely Taiwan, we have chosen China Wind songs that originated from Hong Kong and their music videos as the primary subject of enquiry. Our central concern is, how do Hong Kong's China Wind music videos engage with hegemonic versions of Chineseness? The choice of Hong Kong is informed by our empirical interest in the complex entanglement of cultural and political power in which the postcolonial city is presumably <b>going</b> <b>through.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time it is, in theory and in praxis, a correspondence with the ongoing debates on Chineseness—debates on not only what but also who defines it. Our analyses show that while Hong Kong's China Wind pop evokes Chineseness, it also undermines it in two major ways: first, to render Chineseness as distant gaze, as ambiguous space and as ongoing struggles; and secondly, its feminization of Chineseness, opening up a space for questions on history and gender performance. In other words, the Hong Kong China Wind we have analyzed here articulates something quite different from a triumphalist celebration of Chinese tradition, value and culture. If China Wind as a whole is a culturalist project to rewrite Chineseness in an authentic, monolithic and indisputable way, Hong Kong's variant, we argue, is resisting...|$|R
60|$|He {{had done}} his best to conciliate the good opinion of his {{vigilant}} neighbours. Their character for contentious orthodoxy was well known. It was at Neuchâtel that the controversy as to the eternal punishment of the wicked raged with a fury that ended in a civil outbreak. The peace of the town was violently disturbed, ministers were suspended, magistrates were interdicted, life was lost, until at last Frederick promulgated his famous bull:--"Let the parsons who make for themselves a cruel and barbarous God, be eternally damned as they desire and deserve; and let those parsons who conceive God gentle and merciful, enjoy the plenitude of his mercy."[134] When Rousseau came within the territory, preparations were made to imitate the action of Paris, Geneva, and Berne. It was only the king's express permission that saved him from a fourth proscription. The minister at Motiers was of the less inhuman stamp, and Rousseau, feeling that he could not, without failing in his engagements and his duty as a citizen, neglect the public profession of the faith {{to which he had}} been restored eight years before, attended the religious services with regularity. He even wrote to the pastor a letter in vindication of his book, and protesting the sincerity of his union with the reformed congregation.[135] The result of this was that the pastor came to tell him how great an honour he held it to count such a member in his flock, and how willing he was to admit him without further examination to partake of the communion.[136] Rousseau went to the ceremony with eyes full of tears and a heart swelling with emotion. We may respect his mood as little or as much as we please, but it was certainly more edifying than the sight of Voltaire <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rite, merely to harass a priest and fill a bishop with fury.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that these men are brave, and I {{have no doubt that}} they are so. How should it be {{otherwise}} with men of such a race? But it must be remembered that {{there are two kinds of}} courage, one of which is very common and the other very uncommon. Of the latter description of courage it cannot be expected that much should be found among the privates of any army, and perhaps not very many examples among the officers. It is a courage self-sustained, based on a knowledge of the right, and on a life-long calculation that any results coming from adherence to the right will be preferable to any that can be produced by a departure from it. This is the courage which will enable a man to stand his ground, in battle or elsewhere, though broken worlds should fall around him. The other courage, which is mainly an affair of the heart or blood and not of the brain, always requires some outward support. The man who finds himself prominent in danger bears himself gallantly, because the eyes of many will see him; whether as an old man he leads an army, or as a young man goes on a forlorn hope, or as a private carries his officer on his back out of the fire, he is sustained by the love of praise. And the men who are not individually prominent in danger, who stand their ground shoulder to shoulder, bear themselves gallantly also, each trusting in the combined strength of his comrades. When such combined courage has been acquired, that useful courage is engendered which we may rather call confidence, and which of all courage is the most serviceable in the army. At the battle of Bull's Run the army of the North became panic-stricken, and fled. From this fact many have been led to believe that the American soldiers would not fight well, and that they could not be brought to stand their ground under fire. This I think has been an unfair conclusion. In the first place, the history of the battle of Bull's Run has yet to be written; as yet the history of the flight only has been given to us. As far as I can learn, the Northern soldiers did at first fight well; so well, that the army of the South believed itself to be beaten. But a panic was created--at first, as it seems, among the teamsters and wagons. A cry was raised, and a rush was made by hundreds of drivers with their carts and horses; and then men who had never seen war before, who had not yet had three months' drilling as soldiers, to whom the turmoil of that day must have seemed as though hell were opening upon them, joined themselves to the general clamor and fled to Washington, believing that all was lost. But at the same time the regiments of the enemy were <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> farce in the other direction! It was a battle between troops who knew nothing of battles; of soldiers who were not yet soldiers. That individual high-minded courage which would have given to each individual recruit the self-sustained power against a panic, which is to be looked for in a general, was not to be looked for in them. Of the other courage of which I have spoken, there was as much as the circumstances of the battle would allow.|$|E

Yet they are such and so great as to place the Torso alone in art, solitary and supreme; while the finest of M. Angelo's works, considered with respect to truth alone, are said to be only on a level with antiques of the second class, under the Apollo and Venus, that is, two classes or grades below the Torso. But suppose the best sculptor in the world, possessing the most entire appreciation of the excellence of the Torso, were to sit down, pen in hand, to try and tell us wherein the peculiar truth of each line consisted? Could any words that he could use make us feel the hairbreadth of depth and distance on which all depends? or end in anything more than bare assertions of the inferiority of this line to that, which, if we did not perceive for ourselves, no explanation could ever illustrate to us? He might as well endeavor to explain to us by words some taste or other subject of sense, of which we had no experience. And so it is with all truths of the highest order; they are separated from those of average precision by points of extreme delicacy, which none but the cultivated eye can in the least feel, and to express which, all words are absolutely meaningless and useless. Consequently, in all that I have been saying of the truth of artists, I have been able to point out only coarse, broad, and explicable matters; I have been perfectly unable to express (and indeed I have made no endeavor to express) the finely drawn and distinguished truth in which all the real excellence of art consists. All those truths which I have been able to explain and demonstrate in Turner, are such as any artist of ordinary powers of observation ought to be capable of rendering. It is disgraceful to omit them; but it is no very great credit to observe them. I have indeed proved that they have been neglected, and disgracefully so, by those men who are commonly considered the Fathers of Art; but in showing that they have been observed by Turner, I have only proved him to be above other men in knowledge of truth, I have not given any conception of his own positive rank as a Painter of Nature. But it stands to reason, that the men, who in broad, simple, and demonstrable matters are perpetually violating truth, will not be particularly accurate or careful in carrying out delicate and refined, and undemonstrable matters; and it stands equally to reason, that the man who, as far as argument or demonstration can go, is found invariably truthful, will, in all probability, be truthful to the last line, and shadow of a line. And such is, indeed, the case with every touch of this consummate artist; the essential excellence--all that constitutes the real and exceeding value of his works--is beyond and above expression; it is a truth inherent in every line, and breathing in every hue, too delicate and exquisite to admit of any kind of proof, nor to be ascertained except by the highest of tests--the keen feeling attained by extended knowledge and long study. Two lines are laid on canvas; one is right and another wrong. There is no difference between them appreciable by the compasses--none appreciable by the ordinary eye--none which can be pointed out, if it is not seen. One person feels it,--another does not; but the feeling or sight of the one can by no words be communicated to the other: it would be unjust if it could, for that feeling and sight have been the reward of years of labor. And there is, indeed, nothing in Turner--not one dot nor line--whose meaning can be understood without knowledge; because he never aims at sensual impressions, but at the deep final truth, which only meditation can discover, and only experience recognize. There is nothing done or omitted by him, which does not imply such a comparison of ends, such rejection of the least worthy, (as far as they are incompatible with the rest,) such careful selection and arrangement of all that can be united, as can only be enjoyed by minds capable of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> process, and discovering the reasons for the choice. And, as there is nothing in his works which can be enjoyed without knowledge, so there is nothing in them which knowledge will not enable us to enjoy. There is no test of our acquaintance with nature so absolute and unfailing as the degree of admiration we feel for Turner's painting. Precisely as we are shallow in our knowledge, vulgar in our feeling, and contracted in our views of principles, will the works of this artist be stumbling-blocks or foolishness to us:--precisely in the degree in which we are familiar with nature, constant in our observation of her, and enlarged in our understanding of her, will they expand before our eyes into glory and beauty. In every new insight which we obtain into the works of God, in every new idea which we receive from His creation, we shall find ourselves possessed of an interpretation and a guide to something in Turner's works which we had not before understood. We may range over Europe, from shore to shore; and from every rock that we tread upon, every sky that passes over our heads, every local form of vegetation or of soil, we shall receive fresh illustration of his principles--fresh confirmation of his facts. We shall feel, wherever we go, that he has been there before us--whatever we see, that he has seen and seized before us: and we shall at last cease the investigation, with a well-grounded trust, that whatever we have been unable to account for, and what we still dislike in his works, has reason for it, and foundation like the rest; and that even where he has failed or erred, there is a beauty in the failure which none are able to equal, and a dignity in the error which none are worthy to reprove.|$|E

Distraught, she visits Benjamin's doctor, who states {{that his mother}} had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically passed. She connects various plot holes in Benjamin's story and realizes that he alone was CLAY: he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmothers in the hotel {{to make it look like}} they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an actual program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again.|$|R
40|$|These {{site-specific}} installations {{were created}} at Lokaal 01 in Breda, Holland for the State Your Business exhibition curated by Leigh Clarke. As I {{was only in}} Breda {{a week before the}} show was to open, my response was shaped more by my views from far away. In looking at the history of The Netherlands, I noticed that economic transmissions and translation from one currency to another were central to shaping this country. In current times, natural gas is a huge component of the economy of The Netherlands, and the transit of gas through a complex system of pipelines {{is one of the key}} driving forces of the Dutch economic system, once again dictated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> intricate tariff systems  that shaped its past. At Lokaal 01, my site-specific installation created a sense of the huge complex of pipelines that moves gas within the country from Groningen to the south, and that is used as a passageway for gas moving from Norway to other countries, from the north of Germany to its southern provinces, and from east to west, linking Dutch to British gas pipelines. For the sound elements, I recorded continuous spoken word narratives as text fragments and spliced and superimposed those sections over the top of each other to fracture the flow of reading and to build new narratives on top of the original text. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time I began working with pipe constructions to funnel the sound, as an intimate experience is created when the listener has to come up close to the opening to listen to the sound. The other aspect of this is that the works announce themselves visually first and through sound second, allowing the viewer to slowly engage with them. Working with a dense economics text on gas transit tariffs, I created two sound works piped through PVC tubing constructions installed in the exhibition space. The Jepma Effect is a sound shred with segments of the text in Dutch, German and English layered over the top of each other, creating breaks in the flow of reading and giving a sense of different transmissions <b>going</b> <b>through</b> at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. For <b>the</b> second piece, Route Service Interruption, I worked with the noise emanating from gas pipes, both the constant noise leaks reported by people living near the pipelines and the frequent emissions recorded at compressor sites along the route...|$|R
40|$|As {{more and}} more trips {{increase}} in the decades, the conflicts between the participants are {{more and more}} frequent. The main topic of the thesis is to study the impact of the conflicts: the impacts of conflicts between right turn motor vehicles and pedestrians at signalized intersection. The study focus the impacts on urban area. In these areas, the conflicts between pedestrians and motor vehicles are particularly distinct. The situation thesis describes is: most of the signalized intersections whose signal for right-turn vehicle and pedestrian <b>going</b> <b>through</b> are at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> phase, thus unavoidably causes a lot of conflicts between pedestrians and motor vehicles during that time, and it also brings about a great chance of accidents as well. The behavior of motor vehicles drivers and pedestrians highly affects the how they will be conflicted. In addition, the impacts could be different with different flow of motor vehicle and pedestrians. In this process, gap acceptance of the pedestrian weighs a lot. And two models are used here to analyze the conflict. One is from the Swedish Capacity Manual and the other is from HCM 2010. In the thesis, a typical signalized intersection is chosen and the video are recorded to obtain data. The thesis discusses the differences of the two models, and some observed behaviors. And, according to the result, 500 pedestrian flow increase will bring 100 saturation flow rate decrease; and pedestrians flow at peak hour will increase travel time of motor vehicle over 100 %. After that, some further studies and alternate methods are discussed...|$|R
