He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Drape</b> is {{a unique}} {{property}} that allows a fabric to be bent {{in more than one}} direction with double curvature. For many years, researchers studied fabric <b>drape</b> in order to evaluate the aesthetic performance of finished garments. However, the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> may not be same as the behaviour of garment <b>drape</b> stand on the same object by visually observation. Such difference would affect the prediction of garment <b>drape</b> based on fabric <b>drape.</b> At present, the study of the difference between the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> is very limited. This study aims to examine the difference of the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> through <b>drape</b> coefficient analysis and <b>drape</b> profile analysis. The effects of fabric mechanical properties on fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> are also investigated experimentally.

40|$|<b>Drape</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors influencing the aesthetics and functionality of fabrics. Therefore, investigation into <b>drape</b> parameters is important for analysing its behaviour. <b>Drape</b> parameters were investigated from different aspects using the Cusick <b>Drape</b> meter and Image Analyser. Firstly, the influence of time on the <b>drape</b> coefficient and number of folds was studied over 24 hours. Usually, <b>drape</b> is considered as a static, time-independent problem. However, this investigation shows that the <b>drape</b> coefficient of a fabric changes si-gnificantly over a longer time period. Furthermore, the comparison of <b>drape</b> parameters is shown using samples with two different diameters. The larger samples have smaller <b>drape</b> coefficient than those with smaller diameters, and their <b>drape</b> is less changeable over time. Basically, the three-dimensional fabric <b>drape</b> is not an independent fabric property, there-fore, the connection between bending rigidity and drapecoefficient was studied. The last aspect of this investigation was the repeatability of <b>drape</b> measurements, and the establish-ment of the required number of measurements for <b>drape</b> coefficient and fold numbers...|$|R

The mechanical property values were used to formulate predictive equations for fabric <b>drape.</b> Shear hysteresis and bending resistance were found to be most closely associated with fabric <b>drape.</b> <b>Drape</b> refers to a fabric’s ability to form folds when bent under its own weight. It is {{an important component of the}} aesthetic appeal of fabrics for both apparel and home furnish-ings. Assessing and analyzing the complex behavior of <b>draped</b> fabrics have been a concern of researchers for a number of years.

In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers.

In the present study, the effects of sewing of different seam were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study <b>drape</b> of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types of seams and three stitch densities.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{development}} of a <b>draping</b> index for fabric simulation. The goal is to define and estimate the fabric’s <b>draping</b> parameters for computer modeling. Using the definition, a methodology for determining the <b>draping</b> properties of the fabric can be obtained by analyzing the contour of a digital image of a fully <b>draped</b> fabric. The material parameters can be input into a physical-based cloth modeling system for <b>draping</b> simulation purposes. Three steps are associated with this method. The first one is a fabric <b>draping</b> measuring system designed to capture the fabric <b>draping</b> images. The second one is a computer simulation system adapted for simulating the <b>draping</b> behavior of fabric using the measured <b>draping</b> index. The third one is a correlation system, designed to relate the <b>draped</b> fabric images against the computer simulation result to derive the <b>draping</b> index. The <b>draping</b> Index in this thesis classifies fabrics into five categories. The main contribution of this research is to provide an effective and scientific method to determine the <b>draping</b> properties of any given fabric and integrate its usage into computer simulation. The method utilizes a very simple set up as compared with established methods such as Kawabata Evaluation System.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Lincoln's death in 1865, the East Room {{contained}} 24 chairs, four sofas, four tables, eight sets of <b>drapes,</b> eight sets of lace curtains, eight mirrors, and one carpet.

25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow <b>drapes.</b> Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the <b>drapes</b> and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other <b>drapes</b> behind window boxes. For the <b>drapes,</b> Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The <b>drapes</b> were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The <b>drapes</b> and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>drape</b> properties of fabrics on final garment appearance and fit has been long understood {{and a great deal}} of research has been carried out in this area. More recently, nonwoven fabrics have begun to create interest among the apparel and fashion design community. In this study, the conventional method of measuring fabric <b>drape</b> was compared with garment <b>drape</b> measurement using an alternative <b>drape</b> measurement system based on an image analysis technique. Garment <b>drape</b> was investigated using dresses suspended on a mannequin. A garment chosen was a shift dress because of its relatively uncomplicated style and shape. Hydroentangled nonwovens were selected as they show good performance and similarity to conventional fabrics in terms of physical and mechanical properties. A graphical user interface was developed to carry out the image analysis and to calculate <b>drape</b> values identifying and determining 23 <b>drape</b> parameters. A range of fabrics including conventional (knitted, woven) and nonwoven fabrics were compared in terms of FAST properties, <b>drape</b> coefficient and <b>drape</b> values. Some nonwoven fabrics were found to give similar performance to some conventional fabrics and better than others. Subjective assessment of the fabric range was carried out in terms of <b>drape</b> amount and preference.
