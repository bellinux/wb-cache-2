The Khadi cotton is treated {{with a mixture of}} starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.Once the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharp reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.The colors are made by the artists from natural sources.

50|$|The Afghan snowfinch builds nests in the burrows and hollows made by rodents, {{including}} ground squirrels, marmots, {{and in one}} recorded case Williams' jerboa (Allactaga williamsi). In particular, it {{is associated}} with the yellow ground squirrel (Spermophilus fulvus). Several of the other southern snowfinch species have similar nesting preferences, as does at least one species that occurs in the Afghan snowfinch's range, the isabelline wheatear. The materials used to line the burrows it nests in are the <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>squirrels,</b> sheep, and dromedaries; and feathers. Nests are built {{at the far end of}} the burrows, as protection from predators. The young hatch blind and helpless, with exposed pink skin and only a few, light-coloured tufts of down. Young give a soft call in response to adults calling at the entrance of a nest.|$|R
