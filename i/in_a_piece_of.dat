5|$|The lower molar of Indraloris {{is known}} from four specimens. GSI D237, an m1 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> jaw, is the holotype of I.himalayensis. YPM 13802, the holotype of I.lulli (= I.himalayensis) was {{originally}} {{identified as an}} m1, but Flynn and Morgan suggested in 2005 {{that it may be}} an m2 instead. YGSP 44443, the holotype of I.kamlialensis, is either m1 or m2, but more likely the former. Part of the trigonid is broken off. YGSP 32152, a very worn m1 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> jaw, represents the unnamed large Indraloris. Vasishat suggested in 1985 that these teeth were instead p4s corresponding to molars referable to Sivaladapis, but this hypothesis has been disproven by the discovery of p4s referable to Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E

25|$|The {{externally}} applied charge {{described above}} under condenser microphones {{is replaced by}} a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized. The name comes from electrostatic and magnet; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> iron.|$|E

25|$|Searching for the {{remaining}} four travelers took more than two months. They were finally found on May 4 under four metres of snow in a ravine 75 metres farther into the woods from the cedar tree. These four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that those who had died first had apparently relinquished their clothes to the others. Zolotaryov was wearing Dubinina's faux fur coat and hat, while Dubinina's foot was wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Krivonishenko's wool trousers.|$|E
25|$|Wimbledon {{was also}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> television history, when on 1 July 1967 {{the first official}} colour television broadcast {{took place in the}} UK. Four hours live coverage of the 1967 Championships was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives {{because it was the first}} Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{electronic}} equipment, for example, {{the connections}} between stages (e.g. electronic mixers, electronic oscillators, amplifiers) may be 'probed' for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single faulty component, each measurement can prove {{that half of the}} stages of a complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.|$|E

25|$|An {{intramolecular}} cyclization {{reaction is}} where the growing polymer chain reacts with a vinyl functional group on its own chain, rather than with another growing chain in the reaction system. In this way the growing polymer chain covalently links to itself in a fashion {{similar to that of}} a knot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> string. As such, single chain cyclized/knotted polymers consist of many of these links (intramolecularly cyclized), as opposed to other polymer architectures including branched and crosslinked polymers that are formed by two or more polymer chains in combination.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{beliefs about}} the burial cloths of Jesus have existed for centuries. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke state that Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> linen cloth {{and placed it in}} a new tomb. The Gospel of John refers to strips of linen used by Joseph of Arimathea and states that Apostle Peter found {{multiple}} pieces of burial cloth after the tomb was found open, strips of linen cloth for the body and a separate cloth for the head. The Gospel of the Hebrews, a 2nd-century manuscript, states that Jesus gave the linen cloth to the servant of the priest.|$|E
25|$|An ouster clause or privative clause is, in {{countries}} with common law legal systems, a clause or provision included <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation by a legislative body to exclude judicial review of acts and decisions of the executive by stripping the courts of their supervisory judicial function. According to {{the doctrine of the}} separation of powers, one of the important functions of the judiciary is to keep the executive in check by ensuring that its acts comply with the law, including, where applicable, the constitution. Ouster clauses prevent courts from carrying out this function, but may be justified on the ground that they preserve the powers of the executive and promote the finality of its acts and decisions.|$|E

25|$|Western composers {{have noticed}} that the rhythm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> qin music can change; once {{they seem to have}} got a beat, the beats change. This {{is due to the fact}} that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how he interprets the piece. However, some melodies have {{sections}} of fixed rhythm which is played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.|$|E
25|$|Tree weta (Hemideina) {{are those}} most {{commonly}} encountered in suburban settings in the North Island. They {{are up to}} 40mm long and most commonly live in holes in trees formed by beetle and moth larvae or where rot has set in after a twig has broken off. The hole, called a gallery, is maintained by the weta and any growth of the bark surrounding the opening is chewed away. They readily occupy a preformed gallery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood (a weta motel) and can be kept in a suburban garden as pets. A gallery might house a harem of up to 10 juveniles of both sexes, females and one male. Tree weta are nocturnal. Their diet consists of plants and small insects. The males have much larger jaws than the females, though both sexes will hiss and bite when threatened.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit board}} fragment, {{allegedly}} found embedded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> charred material, {{was identified as}} part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so. Bollier later claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main line of inquiry, though this claim has never been verified.|$|E
