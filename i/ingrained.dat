5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply <b>ingrained</b> that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were <b>ingrained</b> in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was {{populated}} by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Guy Lombardo {{and the decline of}} the Royal Canadians' special, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity, and became <b>ingrained</b> in pop culture—even {{prompting}} Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parody of his role. To this day, New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations, which were historically not measured by Nielsen. Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 2004, and served as a Times Square correspondent alongside Peter Jennings for ABC News's special coverage of year 2000 celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Gone {{with the}} Wind {{has been criticized}} as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became <b>ingrained</b> in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the <b>ingrained</b> social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly <b>ingrained</b> in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an <b>ingrained</b> desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Modern Yunnan {{in southwestern}} China was annexed into the Han Empire after the {{establishment}} of a Chinese prefecture in 109 BC. Cultural assimilation of the Baiyue tribes was implemented through the teaching of Chinese ethics was supported under the reign of Qin Shi Huang. The growing influence of Chinese culture is apparent in excavated Dian artifacts, and coins, ceramics, mirrors, and bronzes have been discovered in Dian manufactured with Han stylistic elements. Dian art adopted the aesthetics of Han imports and by 100, the indigenous Dian culture had largely disappeared. Northern Chinese culture had become largely <b>ingrained</b> in the south. The expansion of China from the North China Plain to the south, a process that began in the Qin dynasty, had reached its height under the Han.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch period {{ended in}} 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out the Dutch and {{established}} the short-lived Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan. The Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing {{large tracts of}} land to support its forces. Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing, the Zheng family was concerned with aboriginal welfare on Taiwan. The Zhengs built alliances, collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools, where Taiwan's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing. However, {{the impact of the}} Dutch was deeply <b>ingrained</b> in aboriginal society. In the 19th and 20th centuries, European explorers wrote of being welcomed as kin by the aborigines who thought they were the Dutch, who had promised to return.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Chinese {{holidays}} such as Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Cold Food Festival, {{and others}} were universal holidays. In {{the capital city of}} Chang'an there was always lively celebration, especially for the Lantern Festival since the city's nighttime curfew was lifted by the government for three days straight. Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily <b>ingrained</b> into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply <b>ingrained</b> political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E
25|$|Lighting a yahrtzeit {{candle in}} memory {{of a loved one}} is a minhag ("custom") that is deeply <b>ingrained</b> in Jewish life honoring the memory and souls of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|Since Buddhist social morals {{were deeply}} <b>ingrained,</b> the Issei tended {{to refrain from}} antisocial behavior. Also, they were {{concerned}} about the Japanese government, that the national image should not be sullied by misbehavior in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|In 64 CE, the Temple High Priest Joshua ben Gamla {{introduced}} a religious requirement for Jewish boys {{to learn to}} read from the age of six. Over the next few hundred years this requirement became steadily more <b>ingrained</b> in Jewish tradition.|$|E
25|$|In Alicante {{province}} Catalan {{is being}} replaced by Spanish, and in Alghero by Italian. There are also well <b>ingrained</b> diglossic attitudes against Catalan in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, {{and to a lesser}} extent, {{in the rest of the}} Balearic islands.|$|E
25|$|Confucianism, a {{governing}} philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship, is deeply <b>ingrained</b> in Chinese culture {{and was the}} official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Mahjong {{culture is}} still deeply <b>ingrained</b> in the Chinese community. Sam Hui wrote Cantopop songs using Mahjong as their themes, and Hong Kong movies have often {{included}} scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, {{and a recent}} subgenre is the Mahjong movie.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomacy}} and political strategy that Wild had first used to major advantage {{in negotiations with}} the International Civil Aviation Organization, combined with his intellectual rigour and a deeply <b>ingrained</b> focus on doing what was right, served CSIRO and Australia well until he retired from CSIRO, aged 62, in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{in the forest}} context also includes evaluating {{the environment and the}} potential safety hazards within a saw crew's area of influence. As a sawyer approaches a task, the ground, wind, cloud cover, hillsides, and many other factors are examined and are considered proactively as part of trained sawyers' <b>ingrained</b> training.|$|E
25|$|The Super Chief was a near-instant success among {{travelers}} who appreciated its modern, air-conditioned cars, private bedrooms, high amenity levels, and smooth ride. The train was staffed with top-of-the-line crews <b>ingrained</b> {{with the best}} traditions of the railroad, and drew passengers not only from other railroads but from other Santa Fe trains such as the Chief.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010 the Welsh Labour Party twice {{refused to}} cross the PCS union picket line, Carwyn Jones citing that it was <b>ingrained</b> in Labour's {{thinking}} not to cross a picket line. This led to strong criticism of the government for not crossing the picket line from the Welsh Conservative Party and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the retail}} setting, direct store {{beverage}} delivery trucks (mobile advertising) {{as well as}} point of sale coolers and vending machines have bright red logo blazoned branding. In terms of food service, Coca-Cola is a food pairing suggestion that is now <b>ingrained</b> as a food match, e.g., for popcorn, burgers, fries, and hot dog combos (Stringer, 2015).|$|E
25|$|It is this {{commitment}} to man's dignity and relief of humanity that inspires the Ismā'īlī Imāmat's philanthropic institutions. Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom one lives, for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or ignorance is a deeply <b>ingrained</b> tradition which shapes the social conscience of the Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|Many Christians {{support their}} churches and pastors with {{monetary}} contributions {{of one sort}} or another. Frequently these monetary contributions are called tithes – whether or not they actually represent ten percent of anything. Some claim that as tithing was an <b>ingrained</b> Jewish custom by the time of Jesus, but no specific command to tithe appears in the New Testament.|$|E
25|$|There are sparse data on {{the role}} of private {{practice}} in Iraq. Estimates range as high as 70% of outpatient visits, compared to approximately 30% before the war. Iraq has included health care as a constitutional right; as government-sponsored care becomes more accessible, the future of private practice will likely change, but it is an <b>ingrained</b> feature of the Iraqi healthcare fabric.|$|E
25|$|These {{religious}} ritual dances {{proved to}} be so strongly <b>ingrained</b> into {{the culture of the}} people prior to the introduction of Christianity, that rather than attempting to eliminate them, Christian missionaries incorporated Christian themes into the songs and poetry which accompanied the dancing, using the dances to spread their religion, as well as enabling millennia-old steps and choreographic forms to continue to be passed down from generation to generation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} formulaic {{language}} are <b>ingrained</b> within specific cultures, {{and in fact}} are sometimes considered an identifying characteristic of people who share a particular religion, or live in a specific geographical region. Along with accents, formulaic language of this type is sometimes considered colorful and somewhat entertaining. Writers often make use {{of this type of}} speech to give the characters in their writings additional personality, helping to make them unique.|$|E
25|$|Communes rank below cantons in Luxembourg's {{hierarchy}} of administrative subdivisions. Communes are often re-arranged, being merged or divided as demanded by demographic change over time. Unlike the cantons, which have remained unchanged since their creation, {{the identity of}} the communes has not become <b>ingrained</b> within the geographical sensations of the average Luxembourger. The cantons are responsible for the ceremonial, administrative, and statistical aspects of government, while the communes provide local government services.|$|E
25|$|Culture {{has been}} shown to {{directly}} affect organizational performance. When viewed through the lens of accepted behaviors and <b>ingrained</b> values, culture also profoundly affects motivation. Whether one looks at the type of culture—strong, strategically appropriate, or adaptive—as Kotter & Heskett do, or at the style of culture—Clan, Adhocracy, Market, or Hierarchy—as Cameron & Quinn do, the connection between culture and motivation becomes clear and provides insights into how to hire, task, and motivate employees.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{the role}} of women has largely {{increased}} in Spain, especially in politics but also in the labor market and other public areas. New laws have officially eliminated all kinds of discrimination, and are even perceived by some as positive discrimination, but a Conservative part of the society is still <b>ingrained</b> in the macho culture. Even so, Spanish women are quickly approaching their European counterparts, and the younger generations perceive machismo as outdated.|$|E
25|$|As {{is typical}} of Igboland, the {{institution}} of traditional chieftaincy title holders, Nze na Ozo is <b>ingrained</b> in Awka-Etiti. There are two grades of traditional title in Awka-Etiti. The first grade is the Ozo title which consists of the following groups of titles; Ezissi, Okpala, Isiokolo, Ikiwi and Ozala. Of these the Ezissi is the most senior, with the responsibility of appeasing the various gods and deities historically befalling on the most senior Ezissi title holder in the Community.|$|E
25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the <b>ingrained</b> social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply <b>ingrained</b> that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E
25|$|Engineering {{was also}} institutionally <b>ingrained</b> in the Roman military, who {{constructed}} forts, camps, bridges, roads, ramps, palisades, and siege equipment amongst others. One {{of the most}} notable examples of military bridge-building in the Roman Empire was Julius Caesar's bridge over the Rhine River. This bridge was completed in only ten days by a dedicated team of engineers. Their exploits in the Dacian wars under Trajan in the early 2nd century AD are recorded on Trajan's column in Rome.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012 {{it is home}} to a {{wide range}} of {{restaurants}} and cafés. At Number 2123 is Mitchells Café and Take Away, which claims to be the oldest café in Leith; while this claim is unverified, the premises has certainly been operating in café format since at least 1924, when it opened its doors as an Italian ice cream parlour. Many long-time Leithers still refer to Mitchells as Lannys; so <b>ingrained</b> is the old ice cream cafe in their memories.|$|E
25|$|Bills and {{correspondence}} {{from government}} and statutory bodies had courtesy slogans in them. In later years, additional {{items in the}} form of stickers, badges, T-shirts, mugs, keychains, vases, notepads and even a musical coin bank that played jingles composed for the courtesy month were amongst an assortment of memorabilia served to continuously remind the public of the ongoing need for Singaporeans to have courtesy <b>ingrained</b> into their lifestyle. Courtesy songs, fables and a website were introduced into the campaign as it entered the 80s and 90s.|$|E
