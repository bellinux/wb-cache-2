They explained the game utilises a game engine specifically designed for Haven, which allows smooth transition from third-person gameplay to piloting a vehicle. The engine also powers the cutscenes, allowing the camera to move and sweep around the landscape of a level, giving the player {{an idea of the}} route they have to take. Landscapes are fractally generated using the PlayStation 2's vector processors, which allows for considerable draw distance. The game also features night and day cycles and alternating weather patterns, such as randomly occurring rain showers (which prompt Haven to pull his hood up when outdoors). The developers were also keen to stress the game features no loading times; [...] "Traveller's Tales intends for the game's loading to be invisible to players after the <b>initial</b> <b>startup,</b> thanks to carefully managed memory usage and constant streaming." [...] They also revealed that after the PlayStation 2 launch, the game would be released for the Game Boy Advance as well as GameCube and Xbox.|$|E

30|$|For Airbnb, {{the initial}} idea of sharing extra {{bedrooms}} is good, {{but the idea}} has been converted to commercial businesses, particularly in big cities like New York and San Francisco. For instance, in New York City, many hosts control multiple listings and over 200 properties in some cases [44]. As mentioned earlier, the academic realm has no consensus on the definition of sharing economy, possibly because of differing interpretations of the act of sharing [10]. Many definitions of sharing economy do not fall into strict concepts of sharing. Some prior conceptualizations (e.g., Belk [20]) assume reciprocity and joint possessions, but these definitions do not truly reflect the practices of sharing economy services such as Airbnb [23]. Belk [20] distinguishes prototypical characteristics of sharing and commodity exchange. Later, Belk [16] identifies commercial car-sharing businesses such as Zipcar and for-profit home-sharing organizations like Airbnb as pseudo-sharing. According to Belk [16], such sharing is not prosocial sharing because “sharing includes voluntary lending, pooling and allocation of resources, and authorized use of public property (sharing), but not contractual renting, leasing, or unauthorized use of property by theft or trespass (pseudo-sharing).” Ozanne and Ballantine [56] argue that sharing behaviors reduce consumption of specific brands or product categories, and thus, they are an alternative to consumption: anti-consumption. Additionally, many of the <b>initial</b> <b>startups</b> that partook in sharing economy have quit operations or changed directions. Many {{of those who have}} stayed have ended the person-to-person narrative as a marketing technique and have begun to compete on price. Thus, the sharing economy has evolved to look less unique and revolutionary, a development which deepens the concerns about its legitimacy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Topology {{control in}} {{wireless}} ad hoc networks has been heavily studied recently. Different geometric topologies were proposed {{to be used}} as the underlying network topologies, in order to achieve the sparseness of the communication network or to guarantee the package delivery of specific routing methods. However, most of the proposed topology control algorithms were applied for all nodes in the networks at the <b>initial</b> network <b>startup</b> stage, and the constructed topologies were kept being maintained thereafter. The overhead of topology control at each node at any time is notable, and this affects the performance of the network and wastes energy for each wireless node. This paper seeks to investigate the practices of efficient on-demand topology control protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. In our new protocol, we only apply the specific topology control technique where and when the wireless node needs it. Our simulation confirms that our scheme has better performance than several existing methods. I...|$|R

Anyone can be a co-founder, and an existing company can also be a co-founder, but frequently co-founders are entrepreneurs, engineers, hackers, web developers, web designers and others involved in the ground level of a new, often high-tech, venture.

In fact, there is no formal, legal definition of what makes somebody a co-founder. The right to call oneself a co-founder can be established through an agreement with one's fellow co-founders or with permission of the board of directors, investors, or shareholders of a startup company. When there is no definitive agreement (like SHA), disputes about who the co-founders are can arise.|$|R

5000|$|MS-DOS 7 is a {{computer}} Operative system which never has been separately released by its inventors Microsoft, but which is the basic (real mode) of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 98SE (as version 7.1, but the difference between version 7 and 7.1 are tiny). A major difference towards earlier versions of MS-DOS however, is the usage of the MSDOS.SYS file. In version 7 isn't this file a binary one, but a pure setting file. Anyone who wants the older boot style (where the booting process ends with a DOS-prompt, and which requires [...] "WIN" [...] to be typed at the prompt in order for Windows to start) could keep on using that same style, by just setting BootGUI=0 in the MSDOS.SYS-file. Otherwise does Windows naturally start up [...] "by it self", which {{was a very important}} issue at the time when Microsoft released Windows 95. But this was in reality only an automatical call for the file WIN.COM, the Windows starting file. So, also Windows 95 and 98 are both highly depending of a Real mode system, although MS-DOS 7 possibly is more [...] "hidden" [...] than earlier versions of MS-DOS. This is also true for Windows Millenium Edition, but [...] "ME" [...] refuses users to use Real mode. [...] Also the paths for (a plausible but actually not necessary) Windows directory and Boot directory is to be set in this new version of the MSDOS.SYS-file. Whilst IO.SYS (although binary different) remained as the <b>initial</b> executive <b>startup</b> file which BIOS booting routines fires up, if located correctly. Also the COMMAND.COM file keeps handle the command prompt. The typical DOS setting files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT essentially retained its functions from earlier versions of MS-DOS (although memory allocation was no longer needed).|$|R

The objective of the IM at CCB HS Areas 1, 2, and 5 is to decrease concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater in the treatment zones via AS to levels that will enable a transition to a monitored natural attenuation (MNA) phase. This OMMR presents system operations and maintenance (O&M) information and performance monitoring results since full-scale O&M began in June 2014 (2 months after <b>initial</b> system <b>startup</b> in April 2014), including quarterly performance monitoring events in July and October 2014 and January and May 2015. Based on the results to date, the AS system is operating as designed and is meeting the performance criteria and IM objective. The performance monitoring network is adequately constructed for assessment of IM performance at CCB HS Areas 1, 2, and 5. At the March 2014 KSC Remediation Team (KSCRT) Meeting, team consensus was reached for the design prepared for expansion of the system to treat the HS 4 area, and at the November 2014 KSCRT Meeting, team consensus was reached that HS 3 was adequately delineated horizontally and vertically and for selection of AS for the remedial approach for HS 3. At the July 2015 KSCRT meeting, team consensus was reached to continue IM operations in all zones until HSs 3 and 4 is operational, once HS 3 and 4 zones are operational discontinue operations in HS 1, 2, and 5 zones where concentrations are less than GCTLs to observe whether rebounding conditions occur. Team consensus was also reached to continue quarterly performance monitoring to determine whether operational zones achieve GCTLs and to continue annual IGWM of CCB-MW 0012, CCBMW 0013, and CCB-MW 0056, located south of the treatment area.
