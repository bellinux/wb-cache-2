5|$|After many failed {{attempts}} {{to steal the}} teddy bear, in desperation, Mr. Burns has Smithers literally beg Homer for the bear. Homer tells Mr. Burns that it is Maggie's now, and she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> can return it. Mr. Burns decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, {{in an act of}} pity, lets the desperate Mr. Burns have the bear.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning that she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{coaches have}} won the award in the same season that they have also won a National Coach of the Year award; of those, only Krzyzewski and Smith have {{achieved}} the feat three times. Four coaches have won during the same season that they have coached a team that won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Frank McGuire, Norm Sloan, Dean Smith, and Gary Williams. North Carolina has the most ACC Coach of the Year awards with 12, while its in-state rival, Duke, is second with 10. Frank McGuire is the only head coach to win the award at two different schools (North Carolina and South Carolina). Each of the original 1953ACC members {{have had at least}} one of their coaches win the award. Among schools that joined the ACC before 2013, Boston College <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has never had a winning coach. Thirty-one different coaches from twelve schools have received the award.|$|E

5|$|In England, Legal Deposit can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E

When Michael and Dave are betrayed by Steve and become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather, Trevor, feeling that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> {{has the right to}} kill Michael, comes to their aid.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
5|$|The eastern gate, {{constructed}} between 1213 and 1215, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> opens {{toward the}} area enclosed {{by the city}} walls of Damascus. It is located {{in one of the}} citadel's square towers and protected by another tower immediately south of the gate tower and a barbacan running between these towers. It is a bent-axis gate running through vaulted passages before reaching the courtyard. Behind it is a square hall in which four columns support a central unusually shaped dome. It incorporates a gate tower from the old Seljuq citadel. The gate lacks defensive structures like murder-holes and is more decorated than the northern gate, which must be related {{to the fact that the}} gate faces the city. The gate is decorated with a superb muqarnas canopy that is now hidden because the outer door is blocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Auxois is very low, {{and it is}} one of the rarest of the nine French draft horse breeds. In 2001, it had the eighth-smallest {{population of}} the nine breeds, making the threats of inbreeding and extinction very real. In 2006, 250 active breeding mares and 32 stallions were reported, with 125 breeders (the term breeder applying to any person owning at least one active breeding mare). The Auxois represented 1 percent of total French draft horse registrations in 2007. Burgundy is by far the main breeding area, with a few horses in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions. There are no known registered Auxois living outside France and it is almost unknown outside of its home region, even within the rest of France. Of the nine French draft horse breeds, the Auxois <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is not exported. Between 1992 and 2011, between 80 and 146 foals were born each year, with numbers ranging from 105 to 128 between 2007 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E
5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E

5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, {{did not make a}} start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
