5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure</b> left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure,</b> becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer pulled into the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure.</b> It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg pulled into the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired with a failure of his energy recovery system. After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired with brake failure, while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E
40|$|Longwall {{operators}} are again {{pushing the envelope}} in terms of life expectancy for longwall shields. State-of-the-art shields are now expected to last more than 60, 000 loading cycles, twice the life expectancy {{compared with those of}} a decade ago. A review of trends in shield design shows that shields continue to increase in both size and capacity. Some state-of-the-art shields now weigh over 30 tons and provide up to 1, 200 tons of support capacity. Although life expectancy has increased and modern shields are structurally more reliable, premature failures do still occur. This paper provides an engineering and operational assessment of shield design and provides key points to observe in what causes premature shield failures. Design practices to improve structural margins of safety that will prevent premature failures from occurring are also examined. A survey of recent shield failures is provided, as well as trends in shield design and how they might impact the performance and longevity of a shield. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>failures</b> are more common than structural <b>failures.</b> Although <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failures</b> occur on all aging longwall shields, they often go undetected for long periods, resulting in degraded support capacity that can lead to serious ground control problems. The fundamentals of shield hydraulics are described in order to evaluate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failures</b> that plague all shields {{at some point in their}} service life, and practical methods to detect <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failures</b> are examined. The paper concludes with recommendations for inspecting damaged shields and safety precautions regarding their continued use...|$|R

25|$|Bad {{luck for}} rivals and {{excellent}} on-track performances from the Colombian {{meant he was}} a title contender, particularly after a key victory at the German Grand Prix. Williams, however, were unable {{to keep pace with}} the latest developments from Ferrari, coupled with a mid-season amendment to tyre regulations that forced the Michelin-shod Williams, among others, to quickly make a new design to avoid being disqualified. With that, the Bridgestone-shod Ferraris returned to form. Montoya failed to claim another victory that year. A drive-through penalty at the United States Grand Prix after a collision with Ferrari's Barrichello ended his title chances in the last race he would finish in 2003.

25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure.</b> After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E

25|$|At the Australian Grand Prix, {{the cars}} again {{occupied}} {{the back row}} of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure,</b> but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a five-place grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a hydraulic pump assembly with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane. In the race, the F110 achieved another double finish, with Senna leading Chandhok home in 16th and 17th positions respectively.|$|E
25|$|The team's test driver, Christian Klien, {{drove the}} F110 {{for the first}} time in free {{practice}} for the Spanish Grand Prix, replacing Chandhok for the first session. Chandhok and Senna qualified 23rd and 24th, but Chandhok was again penalised five places on the starting grid, this time for an unscheduled gearbox change. Senna crashed out on the first lap of the race, whilst Chandhok sustained damage to the front end of his F110 after colliding with Jaime Alguersuari as the Toro Rosso driver lapped him, forcing him to retire. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Senna outqualified Chandhok by over a second after new parts were fitted to his car; the drivers started from 22nd and 23rd on the grid as Fernando Alonso was unable to take part in qualifying. In the race, both cars ran ahead of Jarno Trulli's delayed Lotus in the closing stages, but Senna retired with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure</b> on lap 58, whilst Trulli's attempt to pass Chandhok eight laps from the finish resulted in the two cars colliding and retiring from the race, although Chandhok was classified in 14th position. Both drivers also hit Rubens Barrichello's steering wheel, which the Williams driver had thrown from his car after crashing earlier in the race. At the Turkish Grand Prix, Sakon Yamamoto drove the car {{for the first time}} in the first practice session instead of Senna. Senna outqualified Di Grassi whilst Chandhok qualified last, but both cars retired with mechanical problems in the race. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Chandhok missed the third free practice session and did not set a representative time in qualifying due to hydraulic and sensor problems, but Senna outqualified Di Grassi to take 22nd place on the grid. In the race, both drivers were able to race with the Virgin cars; Chandhok finished in 18th position, whilst Senna retired after losing second gear.|$|E
500|$|The MiGs were [...] below Davis and Littlefield and had {{not noticed}} them. Without hesitating, Davis {{immediately}} flew behind the MiG-15 formation and attacked them from the rear. His surprise attack destroyed one of the MiG-15s, and he quickly turned to the next closest MiG and destroyed it before it could outmaneuver him. By this time, Davis and Littlefield passed many of the MiGs and some that were behind them began firing. Davis then moved to target a third MiG {{at the front of}} the formation, but as he was lining up his shot a MiG scored a direct hit on Davis' fuselage, causing his aircraft to spin out of control. Littlefield said later, that he spotted Davis' landing gear open, indicating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failure,</b> and that he attempted to defend Davis' aircraft as it lost altitude until Davis crashed and died. Littlefield reported he did not see Davis bail out of his aircraft. Davis was declared missing in action and presumed killed. Intense aerial searches of the area later revealed no evidence that Davis had survived the crash. In fact, a week after the incident, the Chinese military searched the region and recovered Davis' body, still in the crashed aircraft. Despite the Chinese discovery of Davis' remains, his body was never returned to the United States.|$|E

After approaching from the south, Pook flew right over a column of vehicles and troops, and was greeted by automatic fire around 4km from the target's area. Argentine authors assert instead that the aircraft was hit by 35mm fire from GADA's 1st [...] section, B battery, which was completing a redeployment from Moody Brook to a position between Sapper Hill and the Stanley racecourse, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Roberto Enrique Ferre. Pook's first hand account recalls to have feeling a [...] "heavy thump", which is compatible with the impact of a large anti-aircraft shell. Nevertheless, the actual target's position given by Pook in his book was too far to the west to being acquired and shot at by GADA's gunners, albeit he is not too much assertive about having been hit by small arms rounds. A British official report states, however, that on June 12 another GR3 was peppered by [...] "AAA splinters" [...] east of Mount Harriet, almost the same location where Pook's jet was damaged.

This paper combines the extended period simulation of water distribution networks with the head driven simulation based reliability analysis which presents the nodal and system reliabilities more realistic than conventional demand driven based analysis. The pressure dependent analysis considers variation of outflows based on pressure variations; however, demand driven simulation method considers fix demand, regardless of pressure variations. A sample network with possibility of one link failure is examined and diurnal profile of reliability values is presented. It is seen that based on the required criteria, reliability values for the critical time or node are crucial to properly show the severity of mechanical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>failures</b> on the <b>hydraulic</b> performance of the system...|$|R
