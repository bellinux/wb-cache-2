40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, manufacture, and test a pair of cheap <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> with mount {{adapters}} to the Instron TT-C tensile testing machine, which is currently out of service in the Materials Laboratory of Central Washington University’s Hogue Technology Building. The <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> would enable tensile, or pulling force, tests on tensile specimens up to 20, 000 lbs, being able to test high carbon steel. The <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> and mounting adapters were designed and manufactured completely by a Central Washington University Mechanical Engineering Technology student who used the cumulative knowledge gained from engineering analysis and manufacturing courses over the span of his four years at Central. All design and manufacturing were done using the Central Washington University facilities and laboratories {{with the exception of}} heat treatments which were outsourced. It is estimated that the initial device construction will cost $ 771. 00 and 440 man hours. Most <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> in industry cost anywhere between $ 6, 000 and $ 15, 000 for assemblies with a 20, 000 lb load capacity. The design of the <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> is simple with no luxury of hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical clamping capabilities. The manufacture of the initial pair of <b>gripping</b> <b>assemblies</b> was unreasonable and robust due to limitations governed by the capabilities of Central Washington University’s lab facilities which also added unreasonable hours to the amount of man hours required. In common industrial factories/warehouses owned by testing machine manufacturers, the amount of man hours would be significantly less...|$|R

5000|$|... (Early 1966): Unlike the 1962 Semi-Auto G3s, these 1966 models had the [...] "push-pin" [...] hole in {{the correct}} place and thus could be quickly {{converted}} to an automatic by replacing the <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> with a full-auto [...] "SEF" [...] trigger group. These had a magnesium phosphate parkerized finish, matching hardwood furniture (stock and forearm grip) and were date stamped [...] "6/66". Even though these versions have the push-pin {{hole in the}} receiver, they were grandfathered in as approved firearms {{after the passage of}} the Gun Control Act of 1968.|$|R
5000|$|The {{guard is}} {{fastened}} to the blade, plug, and <b>grip</b> <b>assemblies</b> by the pommel, a type of threaded fastener, the specific type of which depends {{on the type of}} grip in use. There are two types of grips used for foils: the traditional straight grips with long, external pommels (comprising the French, Italian, and Spanish varieties, and orthopedic); and the newer design of pistol grips, which fix the hand in a specific, ergonomic position, and which have pommels that fit into a countersink {{in the back of the}} grip.|$|R

The three basic models include the XL semi-automatic (with -inch basic barrel), XT semi-automatic (adding an expansion chamber, front <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> and 11-inch barrel), and eXT Electronic - which operates at fully automatic twelve or fifteen BPS, single-shot, or three round burst. The markers all feature a high impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed neck, in-line bolt system and a 200-round gravity feed hopper.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{design was}} wrongly {{thought to have}} {{influenced}} today's Hungarian saber, which is used in sport fencing, however, there is no connection to the modern fencing sabre, which developed from traditional Hungarian and Italian weapons and was introduced in 1910. A modern reproduction is 44 in overall with a 35 in blade and weighs 2+1/2 lb. The blade is straight and tapered, the front edge running the whole length of the blade and double-edged for half its length. Considering {{the weight of the}} bell and <b>grip</b> <b>assembly,</b> it would be balanced much closer to the hand than the typical weapon associated with the name [...] "cavalry saber".|$|R
5000|$|The M1 was {{essentially}} a sniper weapon, not primarily intended for military field application, but for anti-terrorist police and special forces' use, who operate on the [...] "one shot, one kill" [...] principle. The single shot action was designed {{to reduce the number}} of moving parts and allow for extreme precision, five hits out of five shots fit in a 25 centimeter radius circle at 1300 meters. Yet, the Hungarian army decided to purchase 25 rifles of the Gepárd M1 type for use as an in-the-field materiel destruction rifle, but did not purchase any of the later variants so far. Owing to the great weight of Gepárd M1, sharpshooters were instructed to abandon the entire weapon if forced to retreat quickly and only save the <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> for proof, rendering the gun useless.|$|R
5000|$|... (1974): These models had the locking-pin tabs {{eliminated}} on {{the front}} end of the <b>grip</b> <b>assembly,</b> and the corresponding locking-pin hole ("push-pin" [...] hole) and bushing at the base of the receiver had a [...] "U"-shaped piece of metal inserted to prevent the attachment of a full-auto [...] "SEF" [...] trigger group. This makes the [...] "flapper" [...] magazine-release paddle between the trigger guard and magazine well inoperative, making the redundant release button on the right-hand side of the receiver the only way to eject the magazine. It also had the cocking-lever endcap altered to prohibit the mounting of most models of the HK G3 bayonet and had the snap rings on the barrel removed so that it couldn't fire rifle grenades. These were painted black with a semi-gloss finish and were date stamped [...] "1/74".|$|R

50|$|The M1 was {{the first}} Gepárd rifle to enter service. It {{featured}} a long barrel for increased accuracy, a skeleton stock to reduce weight, and used the heavy 12.7×108mm cartridge. However, the rifle was complicated to reload. The M1 fired only one shot and would then have to be manually reloaded. To do this, the user had to rotate, pull back, remove the <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> (whose shape resembles a signal-flare handgun), and insert another cartridge. This tedious task took time to master and slowed the weapon's rate of fire. Other difficulties such as high recoil also plagued the M1. The recoil problem was solved {{with the addition of}} a barrel that recoiled back after each shot. The design was inspired by artillery cannons, which face the same impediment. Still, the Gepárd rifles need specially made, high-strength telescopic gunsights. Improvements, such as the addition of a carrier/lafette backpack and a longer barrel, led to the M1A1 variant, but at 21 kilograms its combat weight was deemed excessive.|$|R
5000|$|Following these trials, the British Army {{adopted the}} Czechoslovak ZB vz.26 {{light machine gun}} {{manufactured}} in Brno in 1935, although a slightly modified model, the ZB vz. 27, rather than the ZB vz. 26 which had been submitted for the trials. The design was modified to British requirements under new designation ZGB 33, which was then licensed for British manufacture under the Bren name. The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> which went from a swiveling grip frame pivoted {{on the front of}} the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection port cover. The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed [...]303 British cartridge, a change from the various rimless Mauser-design cartridges such as the 8mm Mauser round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.|$|R

5000|$|... (1962): There are 3 {{different}} {{date stamps}} {{from this year}} in the United States, all with differences. By far the most desirable, and also the rarest, are the 3/62. These models are identical to the G3 Automatic Rifle except for having a swing-down semi-auto [...] "SE" [...] <b>grip</b> <b>assembly.</b> It was literally able to be converted to a full-auto G3 by changing the trigger group and bolt, no need to change the location of the push pin {{or any of the other}} features. They were all marked G3. This is why it is the most desirable of all semi-automatic G3s, and they are also incredibly rare with less than 3 known to exist in the United States (known as Santa Fe [...] "swing downs") still in semi-automatic form. Most were registered as full-auto hosts. Their value as full auto hosts is no more or less than any other G3, it is their value as a semi-automatic which is extremely high in comparison to other G3s, having sold on Gunbroker for over $20,000 on two occasions, matching the prices of full automatic G3s. It might be one of the only examples of a fully automatic transferrable that is valued the same whether or not it is in the registry. 7/62 is the second most common date from 1962, and like the March labeled guns was marked G3. However, the push pin hole was moved so that a full automatic trigger pack could NOT be installed without major machine work. They were stamped G3. The most common of 1962s are the 11/62, which is identical to the 7/62 except that part of the batch were labeled HK41s. They had the altered location of the push-pin hole, therefore requiring substantial work to turn into a fully automatic G3. There is a mix of G3 and HK41 markings among these date stamps. H&K changed their name to [...] "HK41" [...] in an attempt to stay ahead of West-German Laws which prohibited civilian ownership of the G3 Automatic Rifle.|$|R

40|$|The Instron Corporation in Canton, MA, {{manufactures}} {{material testing}} systems. These systems {{are used to}} evaluate the tensile strength of metals, plastics, composites, textiles, and other materials by holding a test sample at each end with a mechanical "grip," pulling in opposite directions, and measuring the applied forces. This thesis describes the efforts of a project improvement team chartered to dramatically reduce inventory for a variety of mechanical grips without increasing cycle time or component fabrication costs. The author developed optimization techniques, queuing theory models, and simulation tools to guide the improvement efforts. The project team achieved a thirty-percent reduction in grip inventory in six months by consolidating redundant supply chains, changing from a make-to-stock to a make-to-order process, and changing from material resource planning to pull production. The inventory reduction increased the inventory turns from less than two to over four turns per year. Strategic inventory placement models suggested the problem could be split into two separate approaches: (1) managing the capacity of the job shop to meet the increased demand from supply chain consolidation; and (2) developing a control system for component and raw material inventories. The analysis of the capacity of the <b>grip</b> <b>assembly</b> job shop uses optimization techniques to specify the assembly lot sizes for the various grips and queuing theory to estimate the reserve capacity required to maintain cycle times under probabilistic demand. Simulations of the job shop assembly process validate the analysis and resource management plan. The continuous review control system specifies reorder points and order quantities for the hundreds of detail components and raw materials. The team's efforts are expected to reduce inventory by a similar amount in the coming months as excessive stocks are consumed. Recommendations for further reductions include improved component outsourcing, disposition of slow-moving inventory, and optimization of safety stock levels. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to inventory reductions of similar magnitude. by Daniel H. Wheeler. Thesis (S. M.)

When the grenade launcher is installed, the combined rifle and grenade launcher is operated with a single trigger. A selector switch on left side of the grip near the trigger guard allows the user to select between rifle or grenade barrels. When the grenade launcher is detached, it is replaced by a vertical grip. A suppressor is also included in the standard kit, as is a quick-change short barrel for use with the suppressor or for when maximum compactness is desired.|$|R
40|$|Due to product {{miniaturization}} and {{the simultaneous}} {{rise in the}} level of integration, the components to be processed are steadily decreasing in size. At the same time, microcomponents and assembly processes are becoming increasingly sensitive to external influences. These factors increase the risk of parts being damaged or important functional structures being contaminated during such steps as feeding processes, for example. Among other things, this trend is causing conventional vibratory feeding methods to reach their technical limits due to process forces and surface effects. It has become extremely difficult or impossible to singularize components and sort them into a defined order for subsequent manual or automated processing, e. g. to be <b>gripped</b> during an <b>assembly</b> step. A new method is described using the surface forces for separating, sorting and arranging micro components. The surface shape of fluids and the gravity are used for moving the floating components to defined positions. The components can be arranged in a magazine or can be sorted by a channel system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the behavior of}} two finger based micro gripper which is made of Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC), an Electro Active Polymer (EAP). An IPMC shows great potential as high-displacement and light weight actuator. Low mass force generation capability is utilized for micro <b>gripping</b> in micro <b>assembly.</b> IPMC responds to low voltage {{in the range of}} 0 - 3 V. The material contains an electrolyte which transport ions in response to an external electric field. IPMC actuation for micro gripping is produced by deflecting material according to bending moment theory. An external electric field generated by suitable RC circuit causes this deflection. It is found that an IPMC actuates from 1 – 5 seconds. The maximum jaw opening and closing position of micro gripper are found to be 5 mm and 0. 5 mm respectively. The effect of tempearture, as observed, shows that the acceptable limit varies from 23. 1 °C to 30. 4 °C while an IPMC is in operation.

40|$|The RoboCrane is a cable driven, {{multi-purpose}} manipulator {{based on}} the Stewart Platform Parallel Link Manipulator. It provides six degree-of-freedom load control via teleoperative, graphic off-line programming, and hybrid control modes. Originally, the RoboCrane was developed under a Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) contract to stabilize loads on conventional cranes. Currently, configurations have advanced to include land, sea, air-lifted, and space applications. It can be designed for high lift-to-weight ratio, stable gantry configurations, flexibility, precise maneuverability, and mobility over a variety of surfaces including very rough terrain. As part of the NIST mission, the Intelligent Systems Division provides research in, develops methods for, and applies intelligent systems technology to improve U. S. industry competitiveness [1] relating to manufacturing, including large scale manufacturing, such as: building, airstrip, bridge, and ship construction. The RoboCrane provides an intelligent machine enhancement or alternative to current construction methods.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} progress in utilizing fully automated machines for the assembly of microoptical systems. Such systems integrate laser sources, optical elements and detectors into tight packages, and efficiently couple light to free space beams, waveguides in optical backplanes, or optical fibers for longer reach transmission. The required electrical-optical and optical components are placed and aligned actively in more than one respect. For one, all active components are actually operated in the alignment process, and, more importantly, the placing of all components is controlled actively by camera systems and power detectors with live feedback for an optimal coupling efficiency. The total number of optical components typically is in the range of 5 to 50, whereas the number of actors with gripping tools for the actual handling and aligning is limited, with little flexibility in the <b>gripping</b> width. The <b>assembly</b> process therefore is strictly sequential and, given that an automated tool changing has not been established in this class of machines yet, there are either limitations in the geometries of components that may be used, or time-consuming interaction by human operators is needed. As a solution we propose and present lasered glass building blocks with standardized gripping geometries that enclose optical elements of various shapes and functionalities. These are cut as free form geometries with green short pulse and CO 2 lasers. What seems to add cost at first rather increases freedom of design and adds an economical flexibility to create very hybrid assemblies of various micro-optical assemblies also in small numbers...|$|R
