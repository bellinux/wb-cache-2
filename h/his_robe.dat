5|$|In 998, a monk is {{betrayed by}} his compatriot, and {{shot to death}} by archers. As they search <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> to find their objective—the mummified hand of Saint Sebastian—they notice a tattoo on the man's body; an ouroboros, symbol of the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

He realizes that had he not tripped, he would have fallen into this pit.|$|E

25|$|The {{standing}} {{figure is}} in typical pilgrim or travelling priest garb: waraji, a grey robe, and light-coloured leggings and arm covers. In addition, {{he wears a}} gong around his waist and carries a shakujō (錫杖) pilgrim's staff. Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif. The character's aggressive pose—right arm removed from <b>his</b> <b>robe,</b> menacing facial expression—indicates that he is likely not a benign pilgrim.|$|E
25|$|Sunni {{tradition}} has {{that the next}} day, in the Hijri year 23, whilst Umar had just begun leading the Fajr (dawn) prayer in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Pirouz had hidden the dagger in <b>his</b> <b>robe,</b> the grip of {{which was in the}} middle, and hid himself {{in a corner of the}} mosque. Shortly after Umar had begun the prayer, Pirūz leapt upon him and stabbed him six times (only three times, according to Ibn Sa'd), this was five times in the stomach and once in the navel, which proved fatal days later. After attacking Umar, Nahavandi stabbed more people, who were trying to subdue him, killing six or nine of them as he tried to flee. When cornered, Nahavandi committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|The three central upper panels show a Deësis of monumental and enthroned figures, {{each with}} a halo. They are the Virgin Mary to the left, John the Baptist to the right, and a central figure who may be either God or Christ – a {{distinction}} much debated amongst art historians. Theories include that the panel shows Christ in Majesty dressed as in a priest's vestments, God the Father, or the Holy Trinity amalgamated into a single person. The figure looks towards the viewer with his hand raised in blessing, in a panel filled with inscriptions and symbols. There are Greek inscriptions decorated with pearls on the hem of <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> or mantle, which, taken from Revelation, read REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINANTIUM ("King of Kings, and Lord of Lords").|$|E

25|$|The unnamed {{narrator is}} brought to trial before {{sinister}} judges of the Spanish Inquisition. Poe provides no explanation of why he is there or of the charges on which he is being tried. Before him are seven tall white candles on a table, and, as they burn down, his hopes of survival also diminish. He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to find himself in a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers {{that he is in}} a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing a scrap of <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> against the wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.|$|E

500|$|In Sparta, Queen Gorgo {{tries to}} persuade the Spartan Council to send {{reinforcements}} to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he [...] "owns" [...] the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces {{her in front of}} the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> a bag of Xerxes' gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes' general again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and throws his spear at Xerxes; barely missing him, the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the God-King's mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.|$|E

He then stealthily draws a dagger from <b>his</b> <b>robe</b> (Otello: Ho un'arma ancor! / I still have another weapon!) and stabs himself. Others {{try to stop}} him, {{but it is too}} late. Before he dies, he drags himself next to his wife and kisses her (Otello: Un bacio...un bacio ancora...ah!...un altro bacio... / A kiss.. another kiss...ah...and yet another kiss).

2500|$|Descriptions of {{the angel}} Moroni vary. In one of Smith's histories, he {{described}} him as an [...] "angel of light" [...] who [...] "had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness.

According to Smith's sister Katharine, the angel [...] "was dressed in white raiment, of whiteness beyond anything Joseph had ever seen in his life, and had a girdle about his waist. He saw his hands and wrists, and they were pure and white." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 January 1556, Humayun, {{with his}} arms full of books, was {{descending}} the staircase from his library when the muezzin announced the Azaan (the call to prayer). It was his habit, wherever he heard the summons, to bow his knee in holy reverence. Trying to kneel, he caught his foot in <b>his</b> <b>robe,</b> tumbled down several steps and hit his temple on a rugged stone edge. [...] He died three days later. His body was laid to rest in Purana Quila initially, but because of an attack by Hemu on Delhi and the capture of Purana Qila, Humayun's body was exhumed by the fleeing army and transferred to Kalanaur in Punjab where Akbar was crowned. His tomb, which was commissioned by his favourite and devoted chief wife, Bega Begum, stands in Delhi, where he was later buried in a grand way.|$|E
