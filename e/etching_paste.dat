5000|$|VIN etching uses {{a variety}} of methods, {{commonly}} a stencil and an acidic <b>etching</b> <b>paste,</b> to engrave a vehicle's vehicle identification number (VIN) onto the windshield and windows. Most parts on a vehicle already {{have at least a}} partial VIN stamped onto them, and many auto parts buyers will not purchase parts that carry identification numbers. Should a thief try to sell the parts from a vehicle for profit, those marked parts carry a higher risk for both the thief and the auto parts seller. Since automotive glass generally have no identification numbers, and are often interchangeable between many different years and models of vehicle, there is usually a much greater profit for the thief compared to other components on the vehicle. If a car's windows are stamped with the VIN, thieves would need to discard the glass before parting out the stolen vehicle, thus reducing or eliminating their profit. [...] VIN etching can also increase the odds of recovery of a stolen car by police.|$|E
40|$|MWT (metal wrap through) {{solar cells}} allow higher efficiencies, while only {{requiring}} two additional process steps. One of these process steps – the contact isolation between the external n-contact {{on the rear}} and the rear p-contact {{is the focus of}} this work. The possibility of realizing this isolation by the <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> isishape® SolarEtch® SiD instead of a laser groove, which was presented at this conference two years ago, is investigated further. Moreover, this rear contact isolation is combined with the paste driven edge isolation simultaneously which was relocated {{to the rear of the}} solar cell. In addition to the experimental approach, the two isolation technologies as well as an isolation implemented by a thermal oxide, which works as a diffusion barrier and passivates the surface at the same time, were simulated to validate the experimental results. A proof of concept is given by two MWT cell runs, which show high parallel resistances and indicated higher efficiencies for the isolation by <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> compared to the isolation by laser grooves. These results are reinforced by the conducted simulation...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} and cost effective process for edge isolation of silicon solar cells by strongly local deposition of <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> isishape SolarEtch® SiD is presented. The deposition of the paste {{was carried out}} by deposition technique being free of contact to substrate, namely dispensing. Basic deposition parameters were figured out and later on refined by design of experiment applying elaborated sub-design. In order to evaluate isolation properties of the new process, experimental trials focusing on process step of edge isolation of standard solar cells were conducted by applying different deposition conditions. For this purpose, experimental trials were sub-divided into two phases: firstly, evaluation of new concept and secondly, its validation by applying industrial conditions of mass production. Conventionally isolated wafers, e. g. by laser scribing, were taken as reference. Comparison of paste-isolated batches with reference batches provided clear evidences for improved cell performances after isolation by <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> over reference batches. The main beneficial factor for improving solar cell’s performances was identified to originate from increased values of JSC. Isolation process by paste was supplemented by ES&H considerations which provided evidence for environmentally friendly process conduction being superior to single side etching...|$|E
30|$|The {{solar cell}} stack was {{prepared}} on ITO-PET substrate OC- 50 from Solutia providing sheet resistance of 50 Ω/□. ITO layer was patterned in R 2 R rotary {{screen printing process}} using HiperEtch <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> purchased from Merck [21]. The patterned ITO-PET roll was processed further with sheet-to-sheet equipment. First, a 30 -nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios VP AI 4083 purchased from Heraeus) was gravure printed as a hole transporting layer on top of ITO layer with lab-scale printer (Labratester, Norbert Schläfli Maschinen). PEDOT:PSS ink was prepared by mixing the PEDOT:PSS and isopropyl alcohol with a ratio of 77 : 23  wt% and a line density of 140 lines cm− 1 : In order to enable the patterning of low viscous PEDOT:PSS ink {{into the shape of}} the leaf without excessive ink spreading, the amount of isopropyl alcohol and size of the engraving were minimized.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{innovative}} {{process for the}} formation of a selective emitter by using an advanced phosphorous glass as a barrier layer against subsequent diffusion. The advanced barrier glass was achieved by the formation of a standard phosphorous glass treated with additional thermal oxidation immediately after deposition in the same process tube. The resistant layer is used as a barrier for the second diffusion after selective opening of the finger contact areas by screen printing of a SiO 2 <b>etching</b> <b>paste.</b> The process was applied for multicrystalline Elkem Solar SoG-Si wafers as well as for references from standard EG-Si. The achieved cell parameters were compared with cell results from a homogenous emitter process. While the efficiency was not enhanced so far due to the relatively high shadow loss of the selective emitter solar cells, the open collector voltage could be increased by up to 9 mV and the short wavelength spectral response increased slightly with this selective emitter. The aim of this work was to combine the SiO 2 barrier with the shallow POCl 3 diffusion in one process step and the optimization of the screen printing process for selective emitter solar cells...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} a new wet etch back selective emitter method {{that uses the}} conventional <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> used in screen printing to control the contact resistance. The HF and HNO 3 (1 : 200) solution was used for 15 s to etch the acid barrier, which resulted in high sheet contact resistance of 90 Ω/sq. PC 1 D simulation was carried out to analyze the cause for the improvements in the cell characteristics of the selective emitter that underwent the wet chemical etch back process. Solar cells of 12.5 [*]×[*] 12.5 cm 2 with a wet etch back selective emitter were fabricated, achieving an improvement of about 13 mV on the Voc compared {{to those of the}} reference solar cell fabricated with the RIE etch back selective emitter. The result showed, Jsc of 37 mAcm− 2, Voc of 638.3 mV, and efficiency of 18.13 %, for the cells fabricated with wet etch back; whereas Jsc of 36.90 mAcm− 2, Voc of 625.7 mV, and efficiency of 17.60 % were achieved for the RIE etch back. The wet etch back process gave more uniform and controllable contact resistance with less etching time than the RIE process, and hence, this process can be applied for mass production at a low cost.|$|E
40|$|MWT (metal wrap through) {{solar cells}} address {{the target of}} {{reaching}} higher efficiencies, while only requiring two additional process steps compared with conventional solar cells. To further reduce the production costs of MWT solar cells one possibility {{is to reduce the}} breakage, which mainly occurs during the production from cell to module and is caused by laser grooves on the rear. These laser grooves isolate the n- from the p-contacts and almost run across the whole cell. For this purpose two alternative isolation methods have been developed; one is based on the <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> SolarEtch® SiD, which etches a groove that replaces the laser groove; the other developed method is based on the diffusion barrier SolarResist ™. Apart from the advantage of less breakage the damaging impact of the laser on the crystalline structure of the wafer is avoided. The functionality of the developed methods has been verified on appropriate test structures. Furthermore the adaptability of the methods has been proved by processing functional MWT solar cells with pFF values of around 82 %. At the same time the comparability with the laser groove has been shown by producing reference cells. The reliability was shown during repeated runs of MWT cell production...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} metallization {{scheme for}} c-Si solar cells other than Ag screen printing, has gained importance in recent years. Metallization {{techniques such as}} two step electroplated contacts of Ni/Cu and Ni/Ag, have shown higher efficiencies in c-Si solar cells. One of the important processes in the electroplated contacts is opening of the dielectric layer (like SiN(x) or SiO(2)). In this paper a novel contact patterning scheme based on use of a thermally sensitive chemical <b>etching</b> <b>paste</b> Merck, Isishape (TM) is presented. Commercially processed c-Si solar cells of area 4 x 4 cm(2) {{are used in the}} experiment. These solar cells are processed for texturization, p-n junction formation, antireflective coating (ARC) deposition and back surface field (BSF), but without front metal contacts. A thermally sensitive paste from Merck, Isishape (TM) is used for etching the ARC. A block of stainless steel is micro-machined in order to get extrusion of metal pattern similar to finger and bus bar for the front metal contact. Arrangements for electrical heating of the metal block are made. Using the electrical heaters the metal block can be heated up to 500 degrees C. Using the proposed technique finger lines of width 250 mu m are developed on the ARC coated textured c-Si wafers. The proposed patterning technique can be used in industrial environment with high throughput...|$|E
