40|$|Photograph of Captain Brown and his {{officers}} aboard the S. S. Ohio during the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce's voyage to Hawaii, 1907. In the foreground, {{a group of}} men are posing in two rows; the row in the back shows six men standing in dark-colored uniforms and the three men in the front row are sitting down with similar uniforms. The old man in the middle is noticeably wearing a two-buttoned jacket. Towards the back of the ship, a rail is visible and, behind it, a crowd of people can be seen standing next to the mast and the chimney pipe. All individuals are standing aboard on the <b>deck.</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> boats are observable to the sides of the ship and smoke is noticeable above the chimney...|$|R
50|$|The Hermod has two cranes at the stern. Originally the starboard-side crane {{was rated}} at 3000 short ton and the port-side at 2000 short ton. In 1984, the lifting {{capacities}} were upgraded to 5000 and 4000 short ton respectively. The main hoist can lift 92 m above the work <b>deck.</b> The <b>auxiliary</b> hoists can lower {{to a depth}} of 3,000 m (10,000 ft) below the work deck. A tandem lift using the main hoists can lift 9,000 short ton at 39 m radius.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the area}} at Auburn and Squirrel was revitalized as the [...] "Village Center" [...] with {{streetscape}} improvements. Pedestrian-friendly development is encouraged {{in this district}} now known simply as Downtown Auburn Hills. At the end of 2013, a number of large projects were completed Downtown, including a four-story graduate student apartment complex, a 233-space parking <b>deck,</b> an <b>auxiliary</b> classroom space for schools and colleges called the University Center and the Downtown Educational Nook (DEN), a refurbished historic log cabin acting as a student and community center.|$|R
60|$|When placed {{aboard the}} Pocastra Captain Ponsberry was treated politely {{and given a}} small room of his own. But the mates and the {{ordinary}} seamen were not so fortunate. Grandon, Larry, and Luke Striker were hustled off to a prison pen on one <b>deck</b> of the <b>auxiliary</b> cruiser, and the others to another pen below, which was even worse.|$|R
40|$|The Continuous Maintenance Program is {{designed}} to maintain ships {{at the highest level}} of material condition while keeping the ships at the optimum operational readiness. In this thesis the deferred maintenance records of seven DDG's were examined during the period FY 1999 to 2000 to determine if trends existed in the types of work being deferred. First, the deferred data were grouped into categories using the System Work List Item Number from data collected in the Maintenance Support Tool. Second, compilations of the grouped data (estimated total mandays and total costs) were divided into FYs 99 and 00. Third, trends were established and then compared to FY 99 and 00 to determine consistencies. The results showed that over 60 % of deferred jobs and estimated total mandays occurred in the categories of hull structure (<b>decks),</b> <b>auxiliary</b> equipment (air conditioning) and outfit/furnishing (habitability). Nearly 50 % of the estimated total costs, however, occurred within the hull structure and ship support services (shipyard services) categories. Trends were also established to determine the Port Engineer's accuracy in job estimates. In FY 00, estimated deferred data were compared to FY 00 actual deferred data. The results concluded that the Port Engineers overestimated total mandays by 9 % and total costs by 10 %. A determination of the effectiveness of the Continuous Maintenance Program could not be reached due to the classification required to make the analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Taken to the New York Navy Yard in April 1908, she was {{decommissioned}} {{there on}} the 21 April. Loaded onto the collier , Shark and her sister ship [...] comprised the <b>auxiliary's</b> <b>deck</b> cargo as she proceeded, via the Suez Canal, to the Philippines. Shark was launched soon after her arrival at Cavite in July and was recommissioned on 14 August 1908.|$|R
5000|$|... was {{originally}} laid down as ARD-18, a non self-propelled floating dry dock in 1944. During World War II USS ARD-18 {{was assigned to}} the Asiatic-Pacific Theater and serviced ships at Guadalcanal and Ulithi. After the war, ARD-18 was sent to Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp.'s yard, circa 1967-68 and was lengthened by adding a 100 ft midsection as well as an additional deck above the uppermost crane <b>deck.</b> Redesignated Medium <b>Auxiliary</b> Repair Dry Dock Endurance (ARDM-3), she served until retirement in 1995.|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} isolation systems (IS’s) for {{bridges and}} viaducts are {{considered in the}} present study. All of them are made of steel-PTFE sliding bearings (SB) to support {{the weight of the}} <b>deck</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> devices, based on different technologies and materials (i. e. rubber, steel and shape memory alloys), to provide re-centring and/or additional energy dissipating capability. An extensive numerical investigation has been carried out in order to (i) assess the reliability of different design approaches, (ii) compare the response of different types of IS’s, (iii) evaluate the sensitivity of the structural response to friction variability due to bearing pressure, air temperature and state of lubrication and (iv) identify the response variations caused by changes in the ground motion, bridge and isolation characteristics. The nonlinear time-history analyses have been carried out using a simplified pier-deck model, where the pier is modelled as an elastic cantilever beam and the mass of the deck is connected to the pier through suitable nonlinear elements, simulating the behaviour of the IS. Both artificial and natural seismic excitations have been used in the nonlinear dynamic analyses...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of Eagle embodies centuries of development in the shipbuilder's art. Eagle is slightly larger than her sister ship Gorch Fock. Overall Eagle displaces 1,824 tons. The hull is riveted Krupp steel four-tenths of an inch thick (10 mm). There are two full-length steel decks with a platform deck below. The raised forecastle and quarterdeck are made of quarter inch steel overlaid with 3 in of teak, as are the weather <b>decks.</b> Her current <b>auxiliary</b> diesel engine, at , is also somewhat more powerful than that of Gorch Fock (though Eagles original diesel auxiliary engine managed only [...] ). There are two [...] Caterpillar generators that can be run by themselves or in parallel together. Eagle has a range of 5450 nmi km at her cruising speed of 7.5 kn under diesel power. She carries a reverse osmosis system that replenishes the ship's fresh water supply at sea.|$|R
50|$|When {{the navy}} {{realized}} {{that it would not}} be able to fund all the GUPPY conversions it desired, it devised the Fleet Snorkel Program (SCB 47B) as a means of adding the minimum necessary modifications to fleet boats. This modernization added a snorkel, a streamlined sail, a higher capacity air-conditioning system, and a more powerful electrical system. The <b>deck</b> guns and <b>auxiliary</b> diesel were removed. Unlike the GUPPY conversions, these boats retained their original deck structure, bow, and storage batteries. Submerged performance of the Fleet Snorkel boats was therefore significantly inferior to any GUPPY conversion. Despite their limited features, the Fleet Snorkel boats served almost as long as the more modern GUPPY boats. Three boats, Piper, Sea Owl, and Sterlet, received a large BQR-4A bow sonar. The ex-USS Chub (S-329) and ex-USS Brill (S-330), both transferred to Turkey in 1948 as TCG Gür (S 334) and TCG 1. İnönü (S 330), were converted to a Fleet Snorkel Submarine in 1953, the work being done first in Turkey's Gölcük Navy Yard and completed in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{internal}} hangar bay {{is shown}} as expansive as well close to 60-80 yards (160-250 feet) in width {{and at least}} 1,000 feet or so in length. Viper launch tubes are also located on this main hangar deck level. However, on the follow up series Blood & Chrome Adamas Viper is shown being loaded into a launch tube by an automated elevator from the overhead. So we might conclude that Glactica has several rows of launch tubes situated below and above each other, or that the Viper is being lifted from a lower <b>auxiliary</b> <b>deck</b> to the main internal flight deck. We are told by the Cylon Cavell that a launch tube is 150 feet in length. Each tube has a large, reinforced airlock at the hangar end, while the other end is open to space. Once a Viper is mounted on the airlocks launch catapult, an airtight blast door closes behind the Viper and the space door opens, clearing the Viper to launch. The Mercury-class battlestars, such as Pegasus, have [...] "doubled" [...] flight pods, with landing decks on both the dorsal and ventral sides. In contrast to other classes, the Mercury-classs flight pods have a second landing deck running the length of each pod that is situated [...] "upside down" [...] relative to the ship and its two [...] "rightside up" [...] landing decks. Vipers on approach to these secondary decks roll 180 degrees ("on their backs") prior to landing. It is unclear whether there are two hangar and maintenance decks per flight pod as well, or whether ships landing on the second deck must be flipped over into the gravity field of a single pressurized hangar bay.|$|R
40|$|Today most ship {{rotation}} angle (steering control during movement) {{increase or decrease}} is done using an operator on <b>deck</b> or the <b>auxiliary</b> system in the ships engine room. Formal regulations suggest using manual inspection of the ship rotation and the work effectiveness of the engine during manoeuvring in ports and in the open sea regions. The accuracy of this procedure is very low and depends on the personnel of the deck. Therefore, automation and computer control systems are constantly required to assist the human eye. This problem becomes clearly visible when dealing with full ship autonomy in the open sea in the short-sea shipping regions. The trend of maritime technology development will only increase {{in the area of}} human interaction decrease with the physical operations and the shipping procedures, which will lead to the future full ship autonomy in the open sea regions around the globe. With the growing automation technologies, predictive control can prove to be a better approach than the traditionally applied visual inspection policy and linear control models. Ship full autonomy is also linked to the ship's machinery regular repair and maintenance that has to be carried out for delivering satisfactory performance and minimizing downtime during transportation operations. In this paper, current stages of development of the intelligent transportation system concept are discussed for the ship autonomy in manoeuvring control and a robust ships' systems integration and communication system concept is presented for several normal and abnormal situations: high-traffic, potentially dangerous situations or port approaching or ship maintenance, with the capability to solve problems with the limited human interface and with a remote control possibility. Then, simplified ship steering motor system for the main pump is analysed for rotation control using control voltage from the converters. Retrieved data from a small experimental control motor is used for the predictive control approach using two different methods: a neural network trained with Basic Levenberg- Marquardt Method and a Linear Model.
