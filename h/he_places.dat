5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance <b>he</b> <b>places</b> upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but <b>he</b> <b>places</b> his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry.

5|$|The next day, {{they learn}} {{that the members of}} the Sanders-Hardiman {{expedition}} are falling into comas, with fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Haddock, and their friend Professor Calculus visit Calculus's old friend Professor Hercules Tarragon, the only expedition member yet to be affected. Professor Tarragon is under police guard, and he shows his visitors the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac, which the expedition brought back with them from Peru. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends ball lightning down the chimney and onto the mummy—which evaporates. Worried, Tarragon states that this reflects the culmination of Capac's prophecy, which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb. Spending the stormy night at Tarragon's house, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac's mummy. They find Tarragon comatose in his bed, with the accompanying crystal shards nearby; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney. The next day, Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon's house when he discovers one of the mummy's bracelets, which <b>he</b> <b>places</b> on himself.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. <b>He</b> <b>places</b> maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. <b>He</b> <b>places</b> his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years.

25|$|Although {{acquainted with}} the {{theories}} of the Eleatics and the Pythagoreans, Empedocles {{did not belong to}} any one definite school.
