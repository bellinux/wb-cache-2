An explorative analysis approach was applied via in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews with major Italian large-scale retail fruit purchase managers. The results show that although sensory properties, handling features, and Italian origin are highly appreciated by professional customers, the need to sell at a premium price might limit the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> for this new variety.

40|$|Pinterest {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing social {{networking}} sites and is attracting the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> as an effective way to interact with consumers. The purpose of this study was to examine: 1) determinants and impacts of Pinterest consumer experiences. Specifically, this study examined the impacts of retailer reputation, trust, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness on Pinterest consumer experiences on retailer SNS. 2) To identify the impacts of Pinterest consumer experiences on consumer satisfaction, behavioral intention, and online retailer relationship. The instrument used existing scales drawn from the literature. A consumer panel (n = 300) of Pinterest users that connect to apparel retailers was used to collect data through an online consumer panel. Reputation is positively related to trust and to perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use and usefulness significantly affected retailer Pinterest consumer experiences. The impact of Pinterest consumer experiences on satisfaction and behavior intention was positive and significant. Satisfaction and behavior intention also are significantly related to online retailer relationship. Results and business implications are discussed, as well are limitations and future research...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} a supply channel composed of one manufacturer and two symmetric retailers. Three cases are studied. The non-cooperation {{case is a}} leader-follower relationship. The manufacturer determines his spending in national advertising and the wholesale price. Then, retailers determine non-cooperatively the price for consumers. In the partial-cooperation case, retailers decide jointly for the price. In the full-cooperation case, {{all members of the}} channel cooperate by maximizing a joint profit function. Interestingly, partial-cooperation reduces the profits of retailers with respect to non-cooperation, when the degree of substituability between the two products proposed by retailers is low. Because of symmetry, this also implies that the total profit of retailers may decrease with partial-cooperation. Thus, when the degree of substituability between products is low, it is in the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> to set their prices non-cooperatively. We propose a cooperative implementable contract between all channel members, which shares the extra-profit due to full-cooperation. We propose a new and unusual evaluation of consumers ’ surplus which positively depends not only on the price-demand function but also on the spending in national advertising. Partial-cooperation is always the worst case for the manufacturer, the whole channel, consumers ’ surplus and social welfare, while full-cooperation is the best case...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: To {{distinguish}} {{and describe}} Lithuanian retail internationalization of the peculiarities {{in the last}} twenty-four years and bases on {{the changes in the}} future. Methodology/methods: The retail internationalization literature explores the theories, concepts, experiences in different countries is the methodological basis for the assessment of the process and the prospect of these process changes in Lithuania. Lithuanian retail internationalization progress of the investigation from the beginning, development and future prospects is divided into three phases. From a methodological point of view, this is a difficult research because even after twenty years. Scientific aim: To analyse retail internationalization process in Lithuania – features and prospects. Findings: Investigate and evaluate three Lithuanian retail internationalization stages showed that each of them has distinct features. A survey of retailers allowed to set retail internationalization level in 2013. Conclusions: The retail trade internationalisation process in Lithuania, which started immediately after the destruction of the socialist economy and proceeded as the foundation for market economy was being laid, was particular in the sense that famous foreign retail trade companies did not immediately enter the Lithuanian retail market. The characteristic feature of the process in Lithuania was the establishment of joint capital companies, while individual foreign businessmen often started their business in the country by opening their first store. Research limitations: no <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> to be in contact regarding research and wide theme was as serious limitations to find out and explore the Lithuanian retail internationalization features. This is the original article, exploring the small market of retail internationalization process characteristics from its beginning until 2014...|$|E
40|$|For a retailer, {{who has a}} {{close and}} {{everyday}} contact with its customers, understanding the customers can be of benefit if {{they know how to}} use the information in the right way. One way of using the customer is to integrate customers when developing new services, to enhance the possibility of the new service gaining market acceptance. Customer insight, Omnichannel retailing and Big Data are areas that recently have caught the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers.</b> The latter two are of interest as these provide retailers with better possibilities of gaining customer insight, by taking the opportunities to observe the customers’ virtual footsteps to a whole new level. This thesis is a study made with the market research company Nepa as employer of the thesis, in order to develop their B 2 B offer with end-customer integration. Why and how customers are integrated were further studied through the frame of reference. The factors that were chosen to describe from a theoretical standpoint how customers can be integrated were type of integration, role of the customer, type of customer and timing of the integration. The underlying factors that were chosen to answer why retailers choose different alternatives among the above mentioned factors were market orientation, service/goods dominant logic, environmental uncertainty and market maturity. The study was made with a qualitative, positivistic approach using a collective case study. The case study {{is a good way to}} be able to answer both how and why-questions and was therefore chosen as method. By investigating multiple cases and performing a cross case analysis the authors were able to draw more generalizable conclusions. Five retailers took part in the study and for each of these a developed service was chosen as case for investigation. By doing low structured interviews using a method called story-telling, the authors let the respondents from each company speak freely about the chosen case, and that information could then be analyzed. The conclusions of the study concern the different ways retailers choose to integrate customers and the reasons they do it in different ways. A company’s market orientation affects if and what type of customer integration is used in the idea-generating phases. The degree of market orientation also affects the amount of occasions and what type of customer integration is used in the execution-oriented phases. Retailers’ turbulent technology environment has influenced their general perception of risk and the risk of unacceptance with the specific project. This results in that a company can initially integrate customers proactively to let them guide the company or the company can consider customer integration to be secondary. Retailers generally are guided by a goods dominant logic which leads to them not choosing to integrate the customers in active roles in the innovation process. Instead, the retailers combine different integration techniques to gain some of the advantages that active customer could have brought. This is also connected to the retailers wanting to get quickly through the early phases of the process and instead use agile development after the launch of the service. The retailers do not choose different types of customers for integration, but the combination of integration techniques can still provide them with some of the characteristics of the more knowledgeable customer...|$|E

The results state that both structures can increase the consumer surplus and social welfare. More importantly, when the platform acts as an e-tailer, the manufacturer and the traditional retailer can form a “win-win” situation. Nevertheless, when the platform acts as a third-party intermediary allowing manufacturers to sell products on the platform directly, it is bound to harm the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the traditional <b>retailer...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{positive}} theory of pricing car access (by parking fees or cordon tolls) to downtown commercial districts. The model {{accounts for the}} special <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> downtown <b>retailers</b> and competing superstores {{at the edge of}} the city, and studies how lobbying by both groups shapes the government 2 ̆ 019 s policy. We find that downtown retailers typically have steeper lobbying contribution schedules than superstores, which induces the government to underprice central roads and parking spaces. This result is strengthened if some consumers visit both downtown and edge-of-town <b>retailers.</b> The presence <b>of</b> an alternative travel mode (e. g. public transport) does not weaken downtown retailers 2 ̆ 019 incentives to oppose car tariffs. Finally, extending the model to allow for lobbying by residents within the downtown retail district we find that residents may lobby for higher or lower parking fees, depending on their relative concern for the vitality of the central district. As a consequence, depending on parameter values, the outcome of lobbying may produce car fees below or above first-best levels. We argue that our results are in line with empirical observations...|$|R

In this paper we analyze if and how a strategic retailer adjusts prices {{in the presence of}} manufacturer advertising. We refer to this adjustment as adver-tising pass-through. We present a simple model to build intuition about how a retailer strategically reacts to manufacturer advertising. Then we examine empirically the relationship between retail prices and manufacturer advertising for a large set of products across eleven product categories. We show that retail prices change over and above what is expected after accounting for the changes in wholesale prices. Moreover, the effect advertising has on sales through its impact on retail pricing is an order of magnitude larger than its direct effect on sales (as reflected in the advertising elasticities). The estimated advertising pass-though rates are not only of sizable magnitude but also vary considerably across products and categories. To explain this variation we relate the obtaine...|$|R

We also examine whether the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> manufacturers and <b>retailers</b> about the preferred distribution system coincide, provided trade opens. We find that market integration is beneficial to all agents only under certain conditions on the degree of market asymmetry and the degree of product differentiation. Interestingly, if integration entails a change in the distribution system, the conflict between manufacturers and retailers strengthens since only retailers prefer free trade when markets are not too asymmetric and when interbrand competition is sufficiently strong. Furthermore, consumers can be harmed by trade and, in a setting without exclusivities, one country may experience a welfare decrease. Finally, the analysis of the strategic choice concerning exclusivity clauses uncovers that retailers and manufacturers never agree about their preference for endogenous distribution systems.
