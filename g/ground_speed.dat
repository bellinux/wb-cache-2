5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on <b>ground</b> <b>speed),</b> a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E

50|$|With aircraft, {{other factors}} {{affecting}} optimum cruise altitude include payload, center of gravity, air temperature, humidity, and speed. This altitude is usually where the higher <b>ground</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{the increase in}} aerodynamic drag power, and the decrease in engine thrust and efficiency at higher altitudes are balanced.|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} used to analyse the BFO values was validated against 87 aircraft {{with the same}} SATCOM equipment operating in the region {{around the time of}} Flight 370's disappearance and against 9 previous flights operated by the same aircraft (9M-MRO). The sensitivity to error was calculated during the early phase of Flight 370 when the aircraft's location, track, and <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> were known. This resulted in an uncertainty of ±28° heading and ±9° of latitude.|$|E
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} propeller {{showed that}} the engine had been running at near-cruising speed {{at the time of}} the impact. Additionally, the condition of the wheels proved that the undercarriage was still retracted, suggesting controlled flight into terrain rather than an attempted emergency landing. During the final portion of Star Dust flight, heavy clouds would have blocked visibility of the ground. It has therefore been suggested that, in the absence of visual sightings of the ground due to the clouds, a large navigational error could have been made as the aircraft flew through the jet stream—a phenomenon not well understood in 1947, in which high-altitude winds can blow at high speed in directions different from those of winds observed at ground level. If the airliner, which had to cross the Andes mountain range at , had entered the jet-stream zone—which in this area normally blows from the west and south-west, resulting in the aircraft encountering a headwind—this would have significantly decreased the aircraft's <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility to determine the cornering characteristics of a 40 x 14 - 16 type VII aircraft tire. These characteristics, which include the cornering-force and drag-force friction coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained for the tire operating on dry, damp and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 20 deg and at <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> from 5 to 100 knots, both with and without braking. The results of this investigation indicated that the cornering capability of the 40 x 14 - 16 type VII aircraft tire is degraded by high <b>ground</b> <b>speeds,</b> thin-film lubrication and tire hydroplaning effects on the wet surfaces, and brake torque. The cornering capability is greatly diminished when locked-wheel skids are encountered...|$|R

5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b> The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|The characteristics, {{which include}} the cornering-force and drag-force {{friction}} coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg and at <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> from approximately 5 to 90 knots. The results indicate that a tread pattern with pinholes in the ribs reduces the tire cornering capability at high yaw angles on a damp surface but improves cornering on a dry surface. A tread pattern which has transverse grooves across the entire width of the tread improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded runway surface. The cornering capability of all the tires is degraded at high <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> by thin film lubrication and/or tire hydroplaning effects. Alterations to the conventional tread pattern provide only marginal improvements in the tire cornering capability which suggests that runway surface treatments {{may be a more}} effective way of improving aircraft ground performance during wet operations...|$|R
25|$|Wind {{gradient}} soaring, {{also called}} dynamic soaring, {{is a technique}} used by soaring birds including albatrosses.

25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the sighting telescope {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more time to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E

25|$|In operation, the bombardier {{would first}} take a {{measurement}} of the wind speed using one {{of a variety of}} methods, and then dial that speed and direction into the bombsight. This would move the sights to indicate the direction the plane should fly to take it directly over the target with any cross-wind taken into account, and also set the angle of the iron sights to account for the wind's effect on <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{new system}} was {{dramatically}} simpler to use. After locating the target in the sighting system, the bombardier simply made fine adjustments using two control wheels throughout the bomb run. There {{was no need for}} external calculation, lookup tables or pre-run measurements - everything was carried out automatically through an internal wheel-and-disc calculator. The calculator took a short time to settle on a solution, with setups as short as 6 seconds, compared to the 50 needed for the Mk.

25|$|Cruise control {{automatically}} {{controls the}} rate of motion of a motor vehicle.

Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} reintroducing mechanical weed control as an alternative for herbicide-resistance weed infestations.

A range of <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> were tested for the row cultivation operation, each with a different per acre cost and timeliness penalty. A typical eastern Corn Belt farm with a rotation of corn and soybean served as the base for the linear programming model. It was found that if the farmer was willing to reintroduce tillage, row cultivation conducted at higher operating speeds in conjunction with separate banded application could be justified under a range of relatively inexpensive herbicide costs as low as $ 7 per acre. When effective herbicides were relatively expensive at $ 30 per acre, the optimal decision would be to use row cultivation and reduce herbicides via banding.

Legs of the flight crossing the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were the longest stages of the circumnavigation, taking up to five days and nights.
