40|$|Volatiles from {{chocolate}} mediate upwind flight {{behavior in}} Ephestia cautella and Plodia interpunctella. We used gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection and found 12 active compounds derived {{from three different}} chocolate types, i. e., plain, nut-containing, and rum-flavored. Eight of the compounds were identified with mass spectrometry, and the activity of three compounds, ethyl vanillin, nonanal, and phenylacetaldehyde (PAA), was subsequently confirmed in both electrophysiological and behavioral assays. In the electroantennogram experiment, PAA and nonanal were consistently eliciting responses in both species and sexes. Ethyl vanillin was active in males of both species, and also in P. interpunctella females. E. cautella females showed no antennal activity in response to ethyl vanillin. All three volatiles were attractive to E. cautella males and P. interpunctella females in a flight tunnel. E. cautella females were significantly attracted only to ethyl vanillin. P. interpunctella males were attracted to PAA. Ethyl vanillin is a novel <b>insect</b> <b>attractant,</b> whereas both nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde mediate behavior in many insect species. A final experiment revealed that a blend of the three volatiles was required to induce landing in the flight tunnel bioassay, and that the landing rate was dependent on dose.

40|$|In Daucus carota L. (Apiaceae) the florets {{comprising}} the central umbellet of inflorescences are usually pink or dark purple, presenting a {{marked contrast to}} the surrounding umbellets, which are generally white. The number of dark florets varies, and some inflorescences have no dark florets. It has been proposed that the dark florets function as an insect mimic, {{and in so doing}} serve to attract insects to the flower. In contrast, other authors, Darwin included, suggest that they are functionally redundant. The present study examined whether the dark florets attract insects, and also whether this effect can be replicated by replacing these florets with an insect. At the study site in Portugal the predominant insect visitor was the beetle Anthrenus verbasci L. (Dermestidae), which is similar in size and shape to the dark florets. Large inflorescences and those with more dark florets attracted more beetles than small inflorescences and those with fewer or no dark florets. Inflorescences with the dark florets removed attracted fewer beetles visitors compared with intact inflorescences. Inflorescences in which the dark florets were replaced with one or a cluster of five dead, freeze-killed A. verbasci attracted more beetles than inflorescences from which the dark florets had been removed. Replacement of the dark florets with a relatively large Meloid beetle resulted in the attraction of markedly fewer A. verbasci. We conclude that the dark florets can act as an <b>insect</b> <b>attractant</b> for some insect groups by acting as an insect mimic, and that they are adaptive, in contrast to the speculations of Darwin. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology...|$|E
40|$|Saffron, the {{processed}} {{stigma of}} Crocus sativus, {{is characterized by}} the presence of several apocarotenoids that contribute to the color, flavor, and aroma of the spice. However, {{little is known about the}} synthesis of aroma compounds during the development of the C. sativus stigma. The developing stigma is nearly odorless, but before and at anthesis, the aromatic compound β-ionone becomes the principal norisoprenoid volatile in the stigma. In this study, four carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) genes, CsCCD 1 a, CsCCD 1 b, CsCCD 4 a, and CsCCD 4 b, were isolated from C. sativus. Expression analysis showed that CsCCD 1 a was constitutively expressed, CsCCD 1 b was unique to the stigma tissue, but only CsCCD 4 a and -b had expression patterns consistent with the highest levels of β-carotene and emission of β-ionone derived during the stigma development. The CsCCD 4 enzymes were localized in plastids and more specifically were present in the plastoglobules. The enzymatic activities of CsCCD 1 a, CsCCD 1 b, and CsCCD 4 enzymes were determined by Escherichia coli expression, and subsequent analysis of the volatile products was generated by GC/MS. The four CCDs fell in two phylogenetically divergent dioxygenase classes, but all could cleave β-carotene at the 9, 10 (9 ′, 10 ′) positions to yield β-ionone. The data obtained suggest that all four C. sativus CCD enzymes may contribute in different ways to the production of β-ionone. In addition, the location and precise timing of β-ionone synthesis, together with its known activity as a fragrance and <b>insect</b> <b>attractant,</b> suggest that this volatile may have a role in Crocus pollination...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Douglas-fir bark was {{extracted}} with n-hexane. A light-colored "wax-like" solid {{was recovered}} from the extract by evaporation of the solvent. Chemically intact sterol esters and ferulic acid esters were isolated from the "wax" without saponification or degradation as had been necessary in former investigations. The characterization of the intact esters provides an improved understanding {{of the characteristics of}} the extracted "wax. " Previous investigations had been limited to an identification of compounds from saponified and chemically fragmented "wax. " The intact, undegraded sterol and ferulic acid esters were isolated by subjecting the n-hexane-soluble materials to column chromatography using Silica Gel G as stationary phase and chloroform-n-hexane (3 : 1 v/v) as developing solvent. The effluents were collected in different fractions and numbered from 1 to 75. Fractions 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11 were tested by thin-layer chromatography using diethyl ether-n-hexane (1 : 4 v/v) and chloroform-carbon tetrachloride (6 : 1 v/v) as the solvent systems. The chromatograms showed two spots (R[subscript]f 0. 96 and 0. 76). Positive results for Liebermann-Burchard tests were found in all of the above fractions except fraction 11, with the most prominent color reaction in fraction 2. Thin-layer chromatographic and gas-liquid chromatographic results showed no free sterols in these fractions and the materials were thus considered to be sterol esters. Fraction 2 was then subjected to saponification since it showed the strongest Liebermann- Burchard test. The unsaponifiable fractions were tested by thin-layer chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography. The results showed the existence of campesterol and [Beta]-sitosterol. Their presence was further confirmed by combined gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry analyses. The saponifiable and diethyl ether-soluble fraction was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and combined gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry analyses. The results showed the existence of n-tridecanoic acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, n-heptadecanoic acid, cis- 9 -octadecenoic acid, n-eicosanoic acid, n-docosanoic acid, n-tetracosanoic acid and the possible existence of n-nonadecanoic acid. Any or all of these fatty acids can form esters with the two sterols. The presence of sterol esters, especially esters of odd-numbered fatty acids, has not been previously reported in Douglas-fir bark. Fractions 13 to 17 on the column chromatograph showed a dark blue coloration when exposed to ultraviolet light. The materials in these fractions were collected and purified by recrystallization and thin-layer chromatography. Infrared spectra of the purified material showed it to be an ester. A saponification reaction was then conducted to study the acid part and the alcohol part of the ester. The alcohol portion was found to be a mixture of behenyl alcohol and lignoceryl alcohol by studies of melting point, gas chromatography, and infrared and mass spectrometry. The acid part was proven to be ferulic acid by melting point test, infrared spectroscopy, field desorption mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The infrared spectrum of the ester showed the presence of hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the ester linkage was between the carboxylic acid group of ferulic acid and the hydroxyl group of the two fatty alcohols. The ferulic acid ester was thus different from the ester found in white fir bark. The present work is the first report to show that ferulic acid does not exist in the free form in n-hexane "wax" as had been suggested earlier. It exists as an ester. The n-hexane-soluble materials were also shown to contain some terpenes, alcohols and other easily volatilized components. To avoid heavy losses, the volatile materials were collected by steam distillation of the bark rather than to attempt to separate them from the n-hexane-soluble fraction. Combined gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry analyses showed the major volatile components to be furfural, terpinene- 4 -ol, [alpha]-terpineol, guaiacol, 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 - acetylfuran, and [Beta]-cyclocitral. The presence of [alpha]-pinene, [Beta]-pinene, limonene, 1, 5 -p-menthadien- 7 -ol, Beta]-citronellol, and gerniol was also tentatively identified. The presence of [alpha]-terpineol is of interest to forest entomologists because it is known to be an <b>insect</b> <b>attractant</b> for bark beetles. The present work is the first report concerning the presence of furfural, terpinene- 4 -ol, [alpha]-terpineol, guaiacol, 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -acetylfuran, and [Beta]-cyclocitral in Douglas-fir bark...|$|E

In the Y-maze, more cane toads selected darkness over incandescent and white fluorescent lights, indicating these light types repelled toads. In comparison, toads did not distinguish between ultraviolet or yellow fluorescent lights and darkness. We then used field trapping trials to determine the effectiveness of white fluorescent and ultraviolet light for attracting amphibians to traps in the presence of insects. In the field, traps equipped with ultraviolet light trapped significantly more toads than those with white fluorescent lights.

40|$|Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) is one {{the most}} {{problematic}} invaders in South Africa invading forest edges, sand dunes, and shorelines by forming impenetrable thickets. Lantana camara invasions degrade natural biodiversity, reduce {{the value of}} land and {{consequently it has been}} a target for biological control, over the last 50 years in South Africa. Studies that have reported on chemical profile of Lantana camara have been conducted around the world but not in South Africa. Hence, the first aim of the current study was to identify the chemical baseline of L. camara varieties in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Recent studies have shown that feeding by one of the agents released against L. camara, Falconia intermedia (Distant) (Hemiptera: Miridae), induces anti-herbivory response through increased leaf toughness and trichome density. A preliminary study conducted also reported the production of volatile chemicals by one variety, Whitney Farm, due to feeding by the mirids. Therefore, the second aim was to determine the induced changes in chemical compounds of L. camara varieties after feeding by F. intermedia. A third aim was to determine the effect these chemical compounds have on the behaviour of F. intermedia. To identify the chemical baseline of L. camara varieties, the essential oils of four L. camara varieties (East London, Port Alfred, Whitney Farm and Heather Glen) were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and that resulted to the identification of 163 constitutive and 75 induced chemicals across the varieties tested. Lantana camara varieties showed different chemical classes but were highly dominated by terpenes. A great variation in the number of constitutive chemical compounds was found in all the varieties. There were 56 constitutive chemical compounds in the Whitney Farm variety, 41 in the East London variety, 36 in the Heather Glen variety and 30 in the Port Alfred variety. The Whitney Farm variety had the highest number (22) of unique constitutive chemicals identified when compared with other varieties. This indicates the chemical distinctiveness of the Whitney Farm variety from the other varieties. In the varieties tested, there were common chemical compounds identified in constitutive and induced (discussed below) states of the plants such as caryophyllene, hexane, naphthalene, copaene and a-caryophyllene. Besides naphthalene, the majority of chemical compounds in South African L. camara varieties were similar to compounds that have been identified across the world, suggesting that they are closely related. The expression of naphthalene in these varieties may be due to changes in the chemicals expressed over evolutionary time as predicted by the Novel Weapons Hypothesis. Amongst the varieties, a great variation in chemical compounds and their concentrations was shown in the induced states of the plants. The concentration of constitutive caryophyllene ranged from (3. 13 - 15. 7) %, to (4. 02 - 11. 10) % after feeding. The concentration of constitutive hexane ranged from (6. 13 - 71. 19) %, to (33. 3 - 75. 8) % after feeding. The concentration of constitutive naphthalene ranged from (0. 21 - 4. 79) %, to (0. 92 - 2. 11) % after feeding. The concentration of constitutive copaene ranged from (0. 57 - 1. 57) %, to (1. 20 - 2. 72) %. Lastly, the concentration of constitutive a-caryophyllene ranged from (1. 18 - 9. 03) %, to (0. 78 - 5. 48) % after feeding. The changes in chemical concentrations in lantana varieties indicated that feeding by the mirid on L. camara varieties causes an induction by either reducing or increasing the chemical concentrations. To determine the effect of the identified compounds on the behaviour of F. intermedia adults, olfactometer bioassays were conducted using a Y-tube technique. A significantly higher proportion of F. intermedia were attracted to undamaged leaves over damaged leaves and purified air. Undamaged leaves attracted 52 % of F. intermedia from the East London variety, 62. 5 % from the Port Alfred variety, 56 % from the Whitney Farm variety, 58 % from the Lyndhurst variety and 54. 5 % from the Heather Glen variety in dual choice trials versus damaged leaves. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of F. intermedia were attracted to damaged leaves over purified air. Damaged leaves attracted 67 % of F. intermedia from the East London variety, 67 % from the Port Alfred variety, 65. 9 % from the Whitney Farm variety, 65. 3 % from the Heather Glen variety and 64. 5 % from the Lyndhurst variety. Olfactometer bioassays were also conducted using purified standard compounds of four chemical compounds identified from essential oils, hexane was used as a positive control as it is reported to be an <b>insect</b> <b>attractant</b> in literature. Hexane was highly attractive to the mirids compared to three standard compounds caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and naphthalene at the rate of 80 %, 73 % and 80 %, respectively. The standard compounds tested against F. intermedia are major compounds contained by L. camara varieties and they have proven to have a repellent effect. This may indicate that after feeding by F. intermedia, the major compounds expressed by the plant varieties repel F. intermedia contributing to the invasiveness of this weed. The increased expression of hexane and caryophyllene after feeding may also indicate increased attraction to some insects, opening up the potential for third trophic level interactions in varieties where this is the case. This is the first study on the chemical composition of essential oils of L. camara in South Africa. Therefore, we recommend that where appropriate chemical profile studies of the invasive alien plants should be considered during host specificity testing, and the vital role of chemical compounds on agent-weed interactions must be taken into consideration with other factors before and after the biological control agents are released...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since when have men {{known of}} {{chemical}} communication? The essay {{will begin with}} a speculation on a possible "prehistoric " scene when early human hunters observed animals. This will lead directly to a more than 300 -year-old description of a rather modern experiment with dogs. From here {{we come to the}} situation about 120 years ago, when sexual attraction of male moths by their females was described. Even the use of female moths for trapping pest species males was already considered 100 years ago. The so far final development began in the 1950 s with the chemical identification of the sexual attractant of the silkmoth Bombyx. Such substances were then named pheromones and bombykol, the sexual attractant of the female silkmoth, was the first pheromone (1959). With chemically pure pheromones and their derivatives available, corresponding physiological studies began in this period and led to the knowledge of the sensory specificity, sensitivity and adaptation of receptor cells and eventually of stimulus-induced behavior. During the following decades, many <b>insect</b> <b>attractants</b> were identified and their application in "integrated pest control measures " is well developed.

40|$|An {{automated}} flying-insect {{detection system}} (AFIDS) was {{developed as a}} proof-of-concept instrument for real-time detection and identification of flying insects. This type of system has use in public health and homeland-security decision support, agriculture and military pest management, and/or entomological research. Insects are first lured into the AFIDS integrated sphere by <b>insect</b> <b>attractants.</b> Once inside the sphere, the insect s wing beats cause alterations in light intensity that is detected by a photoelectric sensor. Following detection, the insects are encouraged (with {{the use of a}} small fan) {{to move out of the}} sphere and into a designated insect trap where they are held for taxonomic identification or serological testing. The acquired electronic wing-beat signatures are preprocessed (Fourier transformed) in real time to display a periodic signal. These signals are sent to the end user where they are graphically. All AFIDS data are preprocessed in the field with the use of a laptop computer equipped with LabVIEW. The AFIDS software can be programmed to run continuously or at specific time intervals when insects are prevalent. A special DC-restored transimpedance amplifier reduces the contributions of low-frequency background light signals, and affords approximately two orders of magnitude greater AC gain than conventional amplifiers. This greatly increases the signal-to-noise ratio and enables the detection of small changes in light intensity. The AFIDS light source consists of high-intensity Al-GaInP light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The AFIDS circuitry minimizes brightness fluctuations in the LEDs and when integrated with an integrating sphere, creates a diffuse uniform light field. The insect wing beats isotropically scatter the diffuse light in the sphere and create wing-beat signatures that are detected by the sensor. This configuration minimizes variations in signal associated with insect flight orientation. Preliminary data indicate that AFIDS has sufficient sensitivity and frequency measuring capability to differentiate between male and female mosquitoes (Figure 1, bottom panel) and fruit flies (data not shown). Similar studies show that AFIDS can be utilized to detect discrete differences between two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. When fully deployable, a wireless network of AFIDS monitors could be used in combination with other remotely sensed data and visually displayed in a geographic information system (GIS) to provide real-time surveillance (see Figure 2). More accurate and sensitive insect population forecasts and effective rapid response and mitigation of insect issues would then be possible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Using gas {{chromatography}} with {{flame ionization detection}} (FID) and electroantennographic detection (EAD) in parallel, butanoic acid, skatole, and (E) - 2, 6 -dimethyl- 6 -octen- 2 -ol were identified as constituents of the abdominal sex-attracting secretion of the male dung beetle, Kheper subaeneus, which reproducibly elicited EAD responses in male and female antennae. This is the first report of the occurrence of (E) - 2, 6 -dimethyl- 6 -octen- 2 -ol as a natural product, for which the name (E) -subaeneol is proposed. In some experiments, a few other constituents of the secretion also gave reproducible responses in specific male and female antennae but did not elicit responses when the analyses were repeated with other antennae. The major volatile constituent of the secretion, identified as (S) -(C) - 2, 6 -dimethyl- 5 -heptenoic acid, {{is one of these}} EAD-active compounds. Both this compound and (E) - 2, 6 -dimethyl- 6 -octen- 2 -ol were synthesized from authentic starting materials for comparison with the natural products.

The symposium introduced recent discoveries and applications of natural products from insect, terrestrial plant, microbial, and synthetic sources for the management of insects, weeds, plant pathogenic microbes, and nematodes. The symposium brought together scientists from academic, government, and private research laboratories around the world. Discussed were natural products with <b>insect</b> repellent and <b>attractant,</b> insecticide, nematicide, herbicide, and fungicide activities, and their current and potential future roles in pest management. Also highlighted was the emission of volatile natural products from trees as a method to detect early stages of pathogen infection. In addition to recent advances, the symposium included reviews of important natural products that have proven successful as commercial products as well as the significance of responsible product stewardship...|$|R
40|$|We review here {{research}} on semiochemicals for cotton pest management {{carried out in}} successive Cotton Co-operative Research Centres from 1998 to 2012. Australian cotton is now dominated by transgenic (Bt) varieties, which provide a strong platform for integrated pest management of key pests such as Helicoverpa spp., but new technologies are required to manage the development of resistance in Helicoverpa spp. to transgenic cotton and the problems posed by emerging and secondary pests, especially sucking <b>insects.</b> A long-range <b>attractant</b> for Helicoverpa moths, based on plant volatiles, has been commercialised as Magnet®. The product has substantial area-wide impacts on moth populations, and only limited effects on beneficial insects. Potential roles are being investigated for this product in resistance management of Helicoverpa spp. on transgenic cotton. Short-range, non-volatile compounds on organ surfaces of plants that do not support development of Helicoverpa spp. have been identified; these compounds deter feeding or oviposition, or are toxic to insect pests. One such product, Sero X®, is effective on Helicoverpa spp. and sucking pests such as whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), green mirids (Creontiades dilutus), and other hemipteran insects, {{and is in the}} advanced stages of commercialisation...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} focused on the {{influence}} of the social environment and the interactions between individuals on the collective decision-making of groups. They showed, for example, that attraction between individuals is at the origin of an amplification of individual preferences. These preferences may concern various environmental cues such as biomolecules that convey information about the environment such as vanillin, which, for some <b>insects,</b> is an <b>attractant.</b> In this study, we analysed how the social context of the cockroaches of the species Periplaneta americana modifies preferences when individuals are offered two shelters, of which one is vanillin scented. One of the principal results of our study is that isolated individuals stay longer and more frequently in a vanillin-scented shelter, while groups choose more frequently the unscented one. Moreover, the proportion of sheltered insects is larger when the group selects the unscented shelter. Our experimental results and theoretical model suggest that the individual preference is not inverted when insects are in a group but, rather, the response to vanillin decreases the attraction between individuals. As a result, aggregation is favoured in the unscented shelter, leading therefore to a collective inversion. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The olive {{fruit flies}} Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), {{as most of}} the Tephritidae species (“true fruit flies”), is a pest of great {{economic}} importance. It’s among the most serious pests of Olea europaea L. in the Mediterranean Basin and in olive growing regions worldwide. Longstanding control programmes as well as current research efforts emphasize the development of long-term management practices, focusing on classical biological control for sustainable management. As part of a classical biological control programme, several attempts have been done in the past in order to rear olive fly ex-situ. Undue efforts are often directed toward producing the largest possible number of flies at the least possible cost, but the flies produced on artificial diets or on factitious hosts may not be effective in carrying out the mission for which they were intended. In the case of B. oleae, genetic changes seem to occur when olive flies are reared on artificial diet causing adverse effect on their performances and fitness if compared to wild individuals. For this reason, researchers are now oriented to obtain laboratory colonies maintaining them on their natural host: developing rearing protocols for olive fruit fly on its natural host would allow bioecological and behavioural studies and successful field-releases of olive fruit fly biological control agents. The present study establishes fundamental guidelines for a small-scale and cost-effective rearing of B. oleae, for the first time successfully culturing year-round the olive fruit fly on its natural host basing upon the continual availability of fresh olive fruits, suitable to oviposit. In line with IPM and biological management purposes, ending the use of non-selective long-lasting poisons and beginning the use of <b>insects</b> <b>attractants,</b> not just pheromones, could potentially become a powerful management tool, interfering with plant and insects at vulnerable steps. At this regard, the second {{purpose of the present study}} was the characterization of the broadest possible range of volatile compounds and to investigate the possible changing trends of biological volatile emissions during development stages. The return of feral olive fly populations to the olive groves after the first abundant summer rains it must certainly be due to volatile compounds emitted by the plants and active on the olive fly. These results involve that host-plant odours play the fundamental ecological role of olfactory attractants and oviposition stimulants interacting with B. oleae. Olea europaea L., the common olive, is considered to be a low emitting species: its terpenoids emissions are generally found to be zero or close to zero. A number of authors have already attempted the identification of volatile components deriving from various parts of the olive plant or dissolved in the oil, by means of distillations, solvent extractions or head-space samples from plant detached portions, mainly focusing on the compounds bioactivity against pathogens and entomo-pathogens. At this regard there is a confuse variety of roles attributed to the plant compounds. During the last few decades, much has been done in order to understand chemical communications in insect-insect interactions and about the insect responses to specific volatiles compounds. Research emphasis is now directed towards insect-plants interactions: it needs to properly investigate and recognize the volatiles released by living plants first of all, testing bioactive aspects of such compounds and correlating insect responses in the second place. The present study reports on the original results of VOCs detection from whole, living olive trees (Olea europaea L.). For the first time, an early comparison of the volatile organic compounds emitted from plants in different phenological stages (vegetative and fruiting stage) was performed. The method developed appears to be functional for a true detection of biogenic compounds from whole olive trees, monitoring the changing trend of volatile profile characteristics during time and obtaining the corresponding volatile profile characteristic for the different phases. For the first time, an early comparison of the volatile organic compounds emitted from plants in different phenological stages (vegetative and fruiting stage) was performed. Despite the usual low emission rates of the specie, the variations of VOCs emission between different phenological stages of Olea europaea L. were clearly displayed and a broad range of emitted volatile compounds were successfully characterized. The information accumulated forms overall an excellent base of knowledge for studying plant-insect interactions and are likely to improve the current strategies against the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae Rossi, for the first time enabling its continuous lab-rearing on the natural host and better clarifying natural occurrence and the ecological role of host allelochemicals, i. e. attractants of the pest.

50|$|Pollination traps or trap-flowers are plant flower {{structures}} that aid the trapping of insects, mainly flies, {{so as to}} enhance their effectiveness in pollination. The structures of pollination traps can include deep tubular corollas with downward pointing hairs, slippery surfaces, adhesive liquid, attractants (often deceiving the insects {{by the use of}} sexual attractants rather than nectar reward and therefore termed as deceptive pollination), flower closing and other mechanisms. In many species of orchids, the flowers produce chemicals that deceive male <b>insects</b> by producing <b>attractants</b> that mimic their females. The males are then led into {{structures that}} ensure the transfer of pollen to the surfaces of the insects. Orchids in the genus Pterostylis have been found to attract male fungus gnats with chemical attractants and then trap them using a mobile petal lip. The general observation of insects being trapped and aiding pollination were made as early as 1872 by Thomas Frederic Cheeseman and did not go unnoticed by Charles Darwin who examined the adaptations of orchids for pollination. Slipper orchids have smooth landing surfaces that allow insects to slide into a container from which a window of light leads the insect outwards through a narrow passage where the pollen transfer occurs. The structures found in large flowers such as those of Rafflesia and some Aristolochia are also evolved to attract and trap pollinators. Trap-flowers that produce deceptive sexual chemicals to attract insects may often lack nectar rewards. Many fly-trapping flowers produce the smell of carrion.|$|R
40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{chain that}} {{is housed in}} the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, generally transfers electrons from NADH to oxygen; {{in the absence of}} oxygen it can use several alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate and fumarate. Transfer of electrons through this chain is usually coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The resulting gradient of protons is then used for the generation of ATP by the F 0 F 1 -ATPase, and for other free energy requiring processes such as solute transport. Quinones form an essential component of this electron transfer chain. Generally, for aerobic respiration, Gram-negative bacteria use ubiquinones and Gram-positive bacteria menaquinones. Many Gram-negative bacteria, however, also synthesize menaquinones, in order to facilitate anaerobic respiration. Escherichia coli, the subject central to this study, even has two different menaquinones: demethyl-menaquinone and menaquinone, both predominantly with a side chain of 8 isoprenoïd units. The expression of the components of the respiratory chain is regulated by a range of regulators, of which the histidine kinase ArcB and the transcriptional regulator FNR are the best studied representatives. In this thesis I provide new knowledge with respect to the complex respiratory chain of E. coli, both with respect to its physiology and with respect to the regulation of its synthesis. In the General Introduction an overview is given of all the components of this respiratory chain, including their biochemical and physiological function. Furthermore, general regulation with respect to oxygen availability is discussed, with emphasis on the regulation by the histidine kinase ArcB. As histidine kinases are also heavily involved in the regulation of the expression of virulence factors, their role as potential targets for (new) antimicrobials is also briefly touched upon in this chapter. Chapter 2 describes the development of a method, based on HPLC analysis, for quantification of the content and redox state of all three (see above) quinone pools in E. coli. Unresolved questions regarding the species of quinone used in nitrate respiration, as well as the so far scarcely studied respiratory chain of Gram-positive bacteria, prompted us to develop a method for analysis of the in vivo redox state of both ubiquinones and menaquinones, without interference of quinone auto-oxidation during sampling and analysis. The data obtained indicate that indeed significant auto-oxidation does not take place in the methods developed. Application of this methodology has led to the surprising observation that even under anaerobic conditions in E. coli, the menaquinone pool is fully oxidized. Identification of the process that causes this anaerobic oxidation of the menaquinones is a topic of ongoing research within the Molecular Microbial Physiology group. Chapter 3 describes the use of the newly developed method of quinone quantification to assess in vivo the consequences of perturbing an aerobic culture with a sudden anaerobiosis. In this experiment the redox state and content of the ubiquinone-pool and the content of the two menaquinone pools were analyzed. We demonstrate that biosynthesis of the two menaquinones proceeds faster than can be explained by regulation of the expression of menaquinone biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that menaquinone biosynthesis is regulated at the biochemical level, although the exact detail of this regulation has not been resolved. In batch cultures of E. coli a correlation between the redox state of the ubiquinone pool and the dissolved oxygen tension in the medium was demonstrated. This is surprising because the affinity of all the quinol:oxygen oxidoreductases is far lower (< 7 μM) than the highest oxygen concentrations at which this correlation is observed. The proton translocation efficiency and kinetic parameters of the three quinol oxidases of the respiratory chain of E. coli were studied in chapter 4. Clear differences with respect to the affinity for two of their substrates, i. e. ubiquinol and oxygen, were observed among them. These data strengthen our hypothesis that both cytochrome bd-I and bd-II are used under micro-aerobic conditions, and that cytochrome bo mainly functions under fully aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, we could also show that, in contrast to what is generally assumed with respect to the physiology of E. coli, cytochrome bd-II significantly contributes to the respiratory flux during aerobic glucose-limited growth. Interestingly, we were able to deduce, by calculations on the growth yield of E. coli, that electron transfer to oxygen via the cytochrome bd-II complex does not contribute to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. This, in contrast to the cytochrome bd-I complex, for which this reaction does result in translocation of 1 proton per electron transferred to oxygen. The respiratory flux, and thus the rate of proton pumping, is partially regulated via the expression of selected respiratory enzymes, under control of the ArcB/A two-component system. In chapter 5 we show that the activity of ArcB, the histidine kinase of this system, can not be directly correlated to the redox state of the ubiquinone pool only, nor to the cellular content of the oxidized form of this quinone, as was thought previously. Therefore, contributions by other regulators were investigated and it was found that under anaerobic conditions a menaquinone- biosynthetic enzyme is essential for activation of ArcB kinase activity. This strongly suggests that menaquinone itself is essential for this activation. An extended model (adapted from the Georgellis model, discussed in chapter 5) has been proposed in which under low micro-aerobic conditions menaquinone functions as the main regulator for ArcB kinase activity (also due to low cellular ubiquinone contents), whilst in the high aerobiosis range ubiquinone takes over this role. Chapter 6 shows that the HPLC-based analysis for quantification of the redox state and content of quinone pools can straightforwardly be applied to a variety of organisms, particularly to those that have quinones with isoprenoid chains longer than 7 units. In the General Discussion several questions are addressed with respect to the complexity of the respiratory chain and the use of uncoupled enzymes. The presence of no less than four different uncoupled NADH dehydrogenases in E. coli may be necessary for the variety of quinone species that the organism can synthesize and for the successful survival in the redox environments it may encounter. As for the presence of uncoupling-, and thus energy-wasting, enzymatic complexes: Some organisms use these as oxygen scavenging enzymes and/or as a way to produce heat locally in order to volatilize <b>insect</b> <b>attractants.</b> As for E. coli, the exact role of uncoupling enzymes remains elusive, although it is speculated that these enzymes could assist the cell in coping with a change from a strongly oxidizing- to a reducing environment, e. g. upon addition of a glucose-pulse to a glucose-limited culture. Uncoupled enzymes may also be of use to the bio-fuel industry, to reach optimal substrate to product conversion ratios. This topic is currently studied with respect to its usefulness in the synthesis of a variety of industrially relevant chemicals...|$|R
40|$|In {{harvested}} forests, {{stand structure}} varies widely with logging history, yet {{little is known}} about how differences in forest structure affect flight activity in insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera). In this project, conducted in harvested eucalypt regrowth forests on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia, I assessed the vertical distribution of insectivorous bats and their potential aerial prey in relation to structural clutter. I also assessed various methodological issues relevant to forest-bat research. Bat echolocation activity and insect abundance were each compared in three vertical strata (understorey, subcanopy and canopy), two locations (forest and track) and three time periods (evening, night and dawn), in old and young regrowth sites. Mean bat activity in the subcanopy and canopy was up to 11 times that in the understorey of forests, a pattern opposite to that of insect abundance. However, vegetation was more cluttered and bat activity lower in the upper strata of young, than old, regrowth. Mean activity on the track was 2 - 5 times higher than in the forest, particularly at understorey level where clutter levels differed most. Time of night had little effect on bat activity. The negative response of bat guilds to increased clutter was strongest in the open-space guild and weakest in the edge-space guild with the highest frequency calls, as predicted from echolocation call design. Although half of the young regrowth sites I used had been silviculturally thinned or selectively harvested 4 - 9 years previously, there was no significant effect of thinning, stratum or their interaction, on the activity of any bat group examined. Thinned regrowth was less cluttered for some vegetation components, but more for others. Therefore, thinning may not have been sufficient to remove clutter-induced restrictions on bat activity. Predator evasion by insects may influence their spatial distribution in forests and, thus, their potential availability to bats. For example, atympanate (earless) moths may escape aerial predation passively using cryptic flight behaviour in proximity to clutter, while tympanate (eared) moths can detect approaching bats and employ evasive flight behaviours. In my insect samples, both eared and earless macromoths (moths with single wingspan ≥ 4. 5 mm) were significantly more abundant and taxonomically rich in the cluttered understorey than the upper strata of old and young regrowth forests. Earless macromoths had greater relative abundance, and were more diverse, in both the understorey and the foliage-rich canopy than the subcanopy, supporting the possibility of passive predator avoidance. However, there was little evidence that frequent activity by echolocating bats in the upper strata of old regrowth forest altered the vertical stratification of eared moths, via evasive flight responses. Combined, macromoths were less abundant, in both absolute and relative terms, where bats were most active. This should confer anti-predation benefits, whether macromoths are hunted preferentially or opportunistically. The potential availability of flying prey for forest bats clearly varies with prey group and vertical stratum. There are likely to be levels of clutter at which even small edge-space bats using highfrequency echolocation are restricted in flight. I assessed the flight patterns of Vespadelus vulturnus in large circular field arenas at forest sites with different logging histories. Light-tagged individuals used similar, direct, patterns of flight in the two oldest classes of regrowth, selecting both subcanopy and understorey strata over the canopy. On average, they flew in two strata and changed flight stratum every three or four observations. However, flight patterns differed in the youngest regrowth age class, which was either unthinned and very densely cluttered, or recently thinned and very open in structure. In both unthinned and thinned regrowth, only the understorey was selected and many bats returned to lower strata after an initial ascent. However, in unthinned regrowth, bats also differed by using three strata and changing flight stratum every two observations. Here, control of flight height may have been difficult whilst negotiating the densely spaced stems. The tendency for bats to fly close to the ground in thinned regrowth suggests that these sites did not provide equivalent flight conditions or habitat for V. vulturnus as older regrowth. I recommend that forest with tall open structure and forest tracks should be preserved in timber production landscapes to facilitate flight and aerial foraging by bats. More research is required to determine whether thinning practices can be refined to attract more use by bats. Forest-bat ecologists should refine their sampling methods to encompass the vertical and horizontal variation in bat activity, clutter and potential prey availability apparent within and among forest management units. I also found that using <b>attractant</b> <b>insect</b> light traps can artificially increase bat echolocation activity, although at different rates for different guilds. Therefore, light traps and bat recording equipment should be spatially separated in habitat-use studies, as was done in my work. However, species identification was enhanced in recordings of bats close to light traps, and this method could be a novel and useful inclusion in presence-absence bat surveys...|$|R
