2500|$|This value, {{expressed}} in hours, gives an <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> a tube typically should last. It's a reasonably common comparison point, however takes many factors into account. The {{first is that}} tubes are constantly degrading. This means that over time, the tube will slowly produce less gain than it did when it was new. When the tube gain reaches 50% of its [...] "new" [...] gain level, the tube is considered to have failed, so primarily this reflects this point in a tube's life.|$|E

50|$|Putu Oka, a {{high school}} teacher and {{freelance}} journalist, was a member of LEKRA, a cultural organization affiliated with the Communist Party. He had been dismissed from the school where he was teaching about a week earlier due to his involvement in LEKRA, so he suspected he might soon be targeted for arrest. He spent the next 10 years behind bars with no <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he would be there.|$|R

[...] "But {{all you do is}} to sit with your newspaper propped up and read the stock reports, and growl when I ask you a polite question. You've no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it makes the days out here, to get up early." ...|$|E
60|$|Towards dusk I noticed {{suddenly}} {{that the top}} of the old stub looked a bit peculiar, but it was some time before I made out a big owl sitting up there. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he had been there, nor whence he came. His back was towards me; he sat up very straight and still, so as to make himself just a piece, the tip end, of the stub. As I watched, he hooted once and bent forward to listen. Then I pulled on my string.|$|E

60|$|It {{was as if}} he and Snip {{were the}} only {{occupants}} of the house. Seth had no very clear <b>idea</b> as to <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{he had been in the}} chamber; but it seemed as if at least two hours had passed since Aunt Hannah bade him good-night, and there was no reason why he should not begin the flight at once.|$|R
60|$|Of our wanderings in {{the great}} swamp I have no clear knowledge. When I strive to remember, I have a riot of {{unrelated}} impressions {{and a loss of}} time-value. I have no <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> we were in that vast everglade, but it must have been for weeks. My memories of what occurred invariably take the form of nightmare. For untold ages, oppressed by protean fear, I am aware of wandering, endlessly wandering, through a dank and soggy wilderness, where poisonous snakes struck at us, and animals roared around us, and the mud quaked under us and sucked at our heels.|$|R
60|$|I have no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Lop-Ear and I {{wandered in}} the land north of the river. We were like mariners wrecked on a desert isle, so far as {{concerned}} the likelihood of our getting home again. We turned our backs upon the river, and for weeks and months adventured in that wilderness {{where there were no}} Folk. It is {{very difficult for me to}} reconstruct our journeying, and impossible to do it from day to day. Most of it is hazy and indistinct, though here and there I have vivid recollections of things that happened.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was close}} upon nine {{when he set}} out. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and {{skipping}} over the pages of Henri Murger's [...] "Vie de Bohème." [...] Ten o'clock passed, and I heard {{the footsteps of the}} maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.|$|E
60|$|A tiny clock {{upon the}} mantelpiece was ticking away the seconds. Arnold had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he {{remained}} there watching. Suddenly, however, {{he received a}} shock. For some time he had fancied {{that one of the}} two figures had disappeared altogether, and now, outside on the window-sill, scarcely a couple of feet from the glass through which he was looking, a man's hand appeared and gripped the window-sill. He stared at it, fascinated. It was so close to him that he could see the thin, yellow fingers, on one of which was a signet ring with a blood-red stone; the misshapen knuckles, the broken nails. He was on the point of throwing up the window when a man's face shot up from underneath and peered into the room. There was only the thickness of the glass between them, and the light from the gas lamp which stood {{at the corner of the}} drive fell full upon the white, strained features and the glittering black eyes which stared into the room. The chink of the curtain through which Arnold was gazing was barely an inch wide; but it was sufficient. For a moment he stared at the man. Then he threw the curtains open and stooped to unfasten the window. It was the affair of a few seconds only to throw it up. To his surprise, the man did not move. Their faces almost touched.|$|E
40|$|Using the {{so-called}} mean-reverting square-root process of Cox et al. (1985 b) we generalize {{the work of}} Dias and Shackleton (2005) by introducing the mean reversion feature into the economic hysteresis analysis under stochastic interest rates and show that such issue highlights a tendency for a widening effect on the range of inaction, though both thresholds have risen {{when compared with the}} no mean-reverting case. In addition, using the work of Linetsky (2004) we compute the hitting time densities in order to have an <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> does it take for a current interest rate to revert and hit the investment thresholds that would induce idle firms to invest...|$|R
5000|$|Days on the Market Property (DOMP) is a {{measurement}} in days of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> that a home has been listed {{for sale to}} the public on the MLS (Multiple Listing Service). Although much lesser known than the phrase [...] "days on the market" [...] DOMM, DOMP is directly associated with DOMM, which is the acronym that home buyers are most familiar with. The days on the market statistic is of interest {{when a person is}} valuing real estate for the purpose of comparison. More days on the market than average may indicate a listing that was overpriced. The other use for this statistic is allowing prospective home sellers an <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it may take to sell a property. The MLS is controlled by the real estate industry and {{has been the subject of}} many lawsuits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I really!" [...] echoed Fred. [...] "Do {{you think}} I {{would have come}} to such a pass as this for a trifle? Why, man, you have no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> my soul <b>longs</b> {{for the life of}} a painter, for the free fresh air of the country, for the poetry of the woods, the water, and the sky, for the music of bird and beast and running brook. You know the true proverb, `Man made the town; but God made the country!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{thought of}} all that. I've a {{photograph}} and a passport and some letters. It isn't that I'm really afraid, but I hate being alone, and you look so nice, Philip dear. I always loved you in blue serge, and I adore your eyeglass. You really have been clever in the small things you have done to change your appearance. Perhaps you are right not to come, though," [...] she went on, looking in the mirror. [...] "These clothes are the best I could get at a minute's notice. Mr. Dane was really quite nice, but he hadn't the least <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it takes a woman {{to prepare for a}} journey. Never mind, you wait until I get back here this afternoon! I am going round to all the shops, and I am going to bring the clothes I buy away with me. Then I am going to lock myself in my room and change everything. I am going to have some of those funny little patent shoes, and silk stockings--and, oh, well, all sorts of things you wouldn't understand about. And do try and cheer up before I get back, please, Philip. Twelve months ago you would have thought all this Paradise. Oh, I can't stop a moment longer!" [...] she wound up, throwing away the cigarette she had taken from the box and lit. [...] "I'm off now. And, Philip, don't you dare to go out of these rooms until I come back!" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{is the way}} {{in which}} {{deposits}} of salt are being now produced on the world's surface, in preparation for that man of the future who, as we learn from a duly constituted authority, is to be hairless, toothless, web-footed, and far too respectable ever to be funny. Man of the present derives his existing salt-supply chiefly from beds of rock-salt similarly laid down against his expected appearance some hundred thousand æons or so ago. (An æon is a very convenient geological unit indeed to reckon by; as nobody has any <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it is, they can't carp at you for a matter of an æon or two one way or the other.) Rock-salt is found in most parts of the world, in beds of very various ages. The great Salt Range of the Punjaub is probably the earliest in date of all salt deposits; it was laid down at the bottom of some very ancient Asiatic Mediterranean, whose last shrunken remnant covered the upper basin of the Indus and its tributaries during the Silurian age. Europe had then hardly begun to be; and England was probably still covered from end to end by the primæval ocean. From this very primitive salt deposit the greater part of India and Central Asia is still supplied; and the Indian Government makes a pretty penny out of the dues in the shape of the justly detested salt-tax--a tax especially odious because it wrings the fraction of a farthing even from those unhappy agricultural labourers who have never tasted ghee with their rice.|$|E

40|$|One-hundred {{consecutive}} {{patients who}} had been treated in the surgical intensive therapy ward completed a form recording their impressions of their stay. Most patients had a reasonable <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they had spent in the ward and few remembered being in pain or excessively worried {{by any of the}} procedures carried out. Those who had been artificially ventilated had little recollection of this period; most either did not realize that their breathing had been artificially maintained or had no idea of the duration of ventilatory support. Very few of the {{patients who had}} tracheal suction via endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes were unduly worried by this, but 60 % of the patients who needed nasopharyngeal suction to help sputum clearance had been considerably worried by this...|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{versions}} of Lotus Notes {{have also been}} criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular operating system should follow that particular OS's user interface style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, {{which is used to}} refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the document is, relative to the portion being viewed). Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.|$|R
50|$|An idle {{computer}} has a load number of 0 (the idle process isn't counted). Each process using or waiting for CPU (the ready queue or run queue) increments the load number by 1. Each process that terminates decrements it by 1. Most UNIX systems count only {{processes in the}} running (on CPU) or runnable (waiting for CPU) states. However, Linux also includes processes in uninterruptible sleep states (usually waiting for disk activity), {{which can lead to}} markedly different results if many processes remain blocked in I/O due to a busy or stalled I/O system. This, for example, includes processes blocking due to an NFS server failure or too slow media (e.g., USB 1.x storage devices). Such circumstances can result in an elevated load average which does not reflect an actual increase in CPU use (but still gives an <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> users have to wait).|$|R

50|$|After Napoleon crowned himself emperor on 2 December 1804, Carnot's republican {{convictions}} precluded {{his acceptance}} of high office under the First French Empire, and he resigned from public life. Probably {{in response to}} the fall of the fortress of Vlissingen to the British during the Walcheren Campaign in 1809, Napoleon employed Carnot to write a treatise describing how fortifications could be improved, {{for the use of the}} École militaire de Metz. Building on the theories of the controversial engineer Montalembert, Carnot advanced <b>ideas</b> on <b>how</b> the <b>long</b> established bastioned system of fortification could be modified for close defense and to allow for counter attack by the besieged garrison.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide descriptive information on the nature and extent of children's difficulties on starting infant school (1975), and the extent to which these difficulties were affected by factors concerned with the organisation of the school intake, such as the age at which children started, the time of year when they started, and the size of the class which they joined. A subsample of the original entrants was followed up in 1977 to obtain some <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> their difficulties persisted. Difficulties were assessed by a 13 item rating scale covering all aspects of the child's behaviour. This scale was completed for each child individually by the child's teacher. Main Topics : Variables Data was collected on settling, cooperation, relation with teacher, concentration, use of play materials, self-reliance, verbalisation, ability to follow instructions, ability to cope with personal needs, sociability, physical coordination, fine motor control, and general difficulty.

5000|$|The {{final product}} of an MCI that happens to link up with the M.E.T.H.A.N.E. method is the act of demobilization which {{is crucial to the}} entire process. The demobilization process has to be in place from the beginning, once an area has been mobilized. This is so {{critical}} because with a mass casualty incident it can get out of hand in a quick way and having everything planned out step by step can alleviate these concerns and help cover for the unexpected. The demobilization process also gives the local community and the corresponding agencies an <b>idea</b> for <b>how</b> <b>long</b> their city and specific areas will be consumed with emergency personnel and essentially blocked off. In many events such as hurricane Katrina the demobilization process is not taken into account from the beginning and the process goes on much longer than necessary which exacerbates financial costs and puts a burden on local agencies such as law enforcement to uphold their everyday duties while also maintaining some grasp on the mass casualty incident.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Thorton {{appeared}} in X2: Wolverine's Revenge, voiced by Don Morrow. After Weapon X breaks free following the Adamantium-bonding procedure, he confronts Professor Thorton restraining him at claw-point while telling Abraham Cornelius and Carol Hines {{to take their}} leave. Professor Thorton reveals that all Weapon X subjects were implanted with a dormant and deadly virus known as the [...] "Shiva Strain" [...] as a failsafe. He also reveals that the virus would kill a normal human in one year, but has no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the virus would kill a human mutant. Professor Thorton isn't seen again after that scene.|$|E
5000|$|JustiServ allows {{consumers}} to compare prices of attorneys online. Gants says, “JustiServ {{you have to}} call around to different lawyers and they tell you $100 or $200 per hour. Once you sign up with a lawyer, you don’t know what they should be charging you for... it doesn’t make any sense.” [...] By asking {{consumers to}} answer a few short multiple choice questions about their case, JustiServ is able to give flat rate estimates for legal cases. Traditionally, when lawyers give hourly rates, consumers have difficulty predicting how much a case will end up costing them, as many have little <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> their case will take.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2011, Presley was hospitalised in Winchester, Hampshire, {{with what}} was {{suspected}} to be a stroke. He was also suffering from pneumonia and fluid around the heart. Presley had suffered a major stroke about a year before. His wife said he first began to feel bad while performing in Germany on 3 December 2011 and had got progressively worse. [...] "Doctors think he has had another stroke. He's not very well and I have no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he'll be in hospital", she said. The following month, Presley announced he {{had been diagnosed with}} lung cancer and therefore decided to retire from the music industry. Just over a year later, on 4 February 2013, Presley died from this cancer and, according to Altham, [...] "a succession of recent strokes." [...] Presley was cremated at Basingstoke Crematorium, Hampshire.|$|E
60|$|I have no <b>idea,</b> of course, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it took me}} {{to reach}} the limit of the plain, but at last I entered the foothills, {{following}} a pretty little canyon upward toward the mountains. Beside me frolicked a laughing brooklet, hurrying upon its noisy {{way down to the}} silent sea. In its quieter pools I discovered many small fish, of four-or five-pound weight I should imagine. In appearance, except as to size and color, they were not unlike the whale of our own seas. As I watched them playing about I discovered, not only that they suckled their young, but that at intervals they rose to the surface to breathe as well as to feed upon certain grasses and a strange, scarlet lichen which grew upon the rocks just above the water line.|$|R
5000|$|Before people {{seek medical}} help {{they try to}} {{interpret}} the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures. A study of 'everyday illness' in Finland including: influenza, infections and musculo-skeletal problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational & physical activity 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers <b>ideas</b> about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models {{are part of the}} process that people use to construct medical culture. They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the [...] "social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know how}} the {{household}} furniture came to be sold for the family benefit, or who sold it, except that I did not. Sold it was, however, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and the kitchen table. With these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night and day. I have no <b>idea</b> for <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> though {{it seems to me}} for a long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, who was very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought it quite a paradise.|$|R
