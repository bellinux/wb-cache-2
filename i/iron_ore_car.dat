The Hunedoara's West station was 5,35 metres higher than the upper factory railway leading to the throat of the number 4 blast furnace, and 6,65 above {{the level of the}} throat of the number 4 blast furnace. The lines of the station were connected to the factory's upper ore tipplers where the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> filled <b>cars</b> were shunted in by a locomotive and emptied. The station was also connected to the charcoal tipplers. Here they've also emptied the limestone. The line was also connected via a metal bridge to the earlier mentioned charcoal tipplers where the charcoal transported from the charcoal kilns in the Poiana Ruscă mountains and emptied here. For the transportation of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> on regular railway, a transfer station was built to transfer the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> from the narrow-gauge <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> to the regular gauge cars. The exclusively mountain specific, mining railway with the high incline, three tunnels (the longest at 747 meters), with numerous artworks, exquisite metallic bridges, had a positive impact on the development and value of the two ironworks, also helped on the improvement of the image and installations of the ironworks, so it proved to be a real success for the local <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> mining and the two ironworks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Adverse service {{conditions}} and malfunction of shoe brakes can induce dangerous tensile stresses {{in the rim}} of railway wheels. Solid wheels for freight cars are subject to “rim chilling ” to induce compressive stresses in the rim; such stresses are beneficial to the wheel safety as they avoid the sudden propagation of potentially evolving defects. Non destructive measurement of residual stresses in a wheel rim is carried by ultrasounds, via the acoustic birefringence effect. The test detects the anisotropy induced by the residual stresses, from the speed of two shear waves with cross polarization. The method was set as a standard for re-qualification of used wheels (UIC 510 - 5) and accepted as a quality test for evaluation of 100 % production (European standard EN 13262 : 2004). The paper shows a solution developed for stress testing by a non-contact EMAT probe embedding two superimposed sensors that generate shear ultrasonic waves with cross polarization, thus providing the required measures without probe rotation. The dedicated electronic hardware is suited to implement manual or automated test applications. The accurate and reliable measure of wave travel time enables residual stress evaluation accuracies up to 10 MPa in lab conditions. The system has been improved to meet increasingly requirements on test speed, flexibility, and error detection without operator intervention. A mechanical rig with a motorised actuator has been developed to ensure scan and stress tests in a portable set-up. Synchronisation to external manipulators allows in-shop wheels/wheelsets automated tests with existing mechanised systems. The paper will show the system proposed to exploit EMAT stress evaluation in the qualification of wheels operating in a mine district, for <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> subject to load per axis exceeding 32 tons...|$|R
