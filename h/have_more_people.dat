500|$|Nielsen {{ratings for}} Homicide: Life on the Street had {{gradually}} declined throughout the , leaving {{the show at}} high risk of cancellation by the time the season concluded. NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts [...] before approving a second season. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he was willing [...] "to do anything to keep NBC from forgetting us", although executive producer Barry Levinson said the show would maintain its realistic visual style, claiming, [...] "We want a camera that's almost a participant in the show."

500|$|Despite {{critical}} acclaim, Homicide: Life on the Street {{suffered from}} poor ratings throughout its , prompting NBC to consider taking {{it off the}} air. After a nine-episode , the network approved four more episodes for the show's [...] as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel the show. The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better. Fontana said of the changes to the series, [...] "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend {{to err on the side}} of breaking ground. But we'd rather <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography. The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

Moore would be referred to as a [...] "Hollywood entertainer" [...] or [...] "Hollywood moviemaker" [...] to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. [...] "They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy." [...] Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was [...] "blunted" [...] by the public relations campaign. He agreed that Sicko contained [...] "a great truth" [...] which he said was [...] "that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie. [...] You know, we <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom. We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay-off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, or being purged by their insurance company, and winding up there." ...|$|E

6000|$|To {{try to see}} blots in the sun, and to pick {{holes in}} Dickens, seems ungrateful, and is indeed an ungrateful task; to no mortal man <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> owed mirth, pleasure, {{forgetfulness}} of care, knowledge of life in strange places. There never was such another as Charles Dickens, nor shall we see his like sooner than the like of Shakespeare. And he owed all to native genius and hard work; he owed almost nothing to literature, and that little we regret. He was influenced by Carlyle, he adopted his method of nicknames, and of hammering with wearisome iteration on some peculiarity--for example, on Carker's teeth, and the patriarch's white hair. By the way, how incredible is all the Carker episode in [...] "Dombey"! Surely Dickens can never have intended Edith, from the first, to behave as she did! People may have influenced him, as they influenced Scott about [...] "St. Ronan's Well." [...] It has been said that, save for Carlyle, Dickens was in letters a self-taught artist, {{that he was no}} man's pupil, and borrowed from none. No doubt this makes him less acceptable to the literary class than a man of letters, like Thackeray--than a man in whose treasure chamber of memory all the wealth of the Middle Ages was stored, like Scott. But the native naked genius of Dickens,--his heart, his mirth, his observation, his delightful high spirits, his intrepid loathing of wrong, his chivalrous desire to right it,--these things will make him for ever, we hope and believe, the darling of the English people.|$|E
6000|$|For my own part, I do {{not think}} the {{maintenance}} of a marriage that is indissoluble, that precludes the survivor from re-marriage, that gives neither party an external refuge from the misbehaviour of the other, and makes the children the absolute property of their parents until they grow up, would cause any very general unhappiness Most people are reasonable enough, good-tempered enough, and adaptable enough to shake down even in a grip so rigid, and I would even go further and say that its very rigidity, the entire absence of any way out at all, would oblige innumerable people to accommodate themselves to its conditions and make a working success of unions that, under laxer conditions, would be almost certainly dissolved. We should <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> of what I may call the [...] "broken-in" [...] type than an easier release would create, but to many thinkers the spectacle of a human being thoroughly [...] "broken-in" [...] is in itself extremely satisfactory. A few more crimes of desperation perhaps might occur, to balance against an almost universal effort to achieve contentment and reconciliation. We should hear more of the [...] "natural law" [...] permitting murder by the jealous husband or by the jealous wife, and the traffic in poisons would need a sedulous attention--but even there the impossibility of re-marriage would operate to restrain the impatient. On the whole, I can imagine the world rubbing along very well with marriage as unaccommodating as a perfected steel trap. Exceptional people might suffer or sin wildly--to the general amusement or indignation.|$|E

You say that you are going to have one room, and that I'm to have another, and that we'll go into the old house to feel at home {{whenever}} we want to; but I believe we'll be like a couple of flies in a barrel!

You can't ask Mr. Burke, because it would be too queer to have him come and live with us, and besides, he'll want a house of his own. Why don't you ask the Thorpedykes to come and live with us? Their roof is dreadfully out of repairs. I know to my certain knowledge that they have to put tin wash-basins on every bed in the second story when it rains, on account of the holes in the shingles! If they had money to mend those holes, they'd mend them, but as they don't mend them, of course they haven't the money. And it strikes me that they aren't as well off as they used to be, and they'll have a hard time gettin' through this winter. Now, there isn't any piece of furniture that you can put in your house that will give it 'such an air of distinction,' as Miss Eleanor calls it, as she herself will give it if you put her there! If you could persuade Miss Eleanor to come and sit in your parlor when you are having company to see you, it would set you up in Plainton a good deal higher than any money can set you up." ...|$|E
