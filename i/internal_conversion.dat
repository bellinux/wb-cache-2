5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or <b>internal</b> <b>conversion</b> takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E

This paper explores changes (or “trajectories ” of change) in land use and cover (LULC) and {{their relationship with the}} consumption of soils in Emilia-Romagna (northern Italy) over a 55 -years period from 1954 to 2008, and separately over three time periods (1954 - 1976, 1976 - 1994 and 1994 - 2008) characterized by distinctive processes of urban and agricultural development. Four high-resolution LULC maps for 1954, 1976, 1994, and 2008 were analysed together with a 1 : 50, 000 scale land capability map used as an indicator of soil quality. Out of an investigated area of around 12. 000 km 2, 34 % underwent changes in LULC over the entire study period. “Agriculture <b>internal</b> <b>conversions</b> ” accounted for 46 % of the changes and “urban expansion ” for as much as 35 %. The first period was characterized by “agriculture <b>internal</b> <b>conversions</b> ” associated with intensification processes. In the second period <b>internal</b> agricultural <b>conversions</b> became even more important. In the third period the most relevant conversion process was agricultural extensivation, with urban expansion also becoming relevant.

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of isomerization {{has been the}} subject of some debate, with two pathways identified as viable: a rotation about the N-N bond, with disruption of the double bond, or via an inversion, with a semi-linear and hybridized transition state. It has been suggested that the trans-to-cis conversion occurs via rotation into the S2 state, whereas inversion gives rise to the cis-to-trans conversion. It is still under discussion which excited state plays a direct role in the series of the photoisomerization behavior. However, the latest research on femtosecond transition spectroscopy has suggested that the S2 state undergoes <b>internal</b> <b>conversion</b> to the S1 state, and then the trans-to-cis isomerization proceeds.

2500|$|The {{dynamics}} {{is quite}} different for high energies, such as occur from an optical transition from a non-degenerate initial state with a high-symmetry (JT undistorted) equilibrium geometry into a JT distorted state. This leads the system to the region near the conical intersection of the JT-split APES in {{the centre of the}} figure. Here the nonadiabatic couplings become very large and the behaviour of the system cannot be described within the familiar Born-Oppenheimer (BO) separation between the electronic and nuclear motions. The nuclear motion ceases to be confined to a single, well-defined APES and the transitions between the adiabatic surfaces occur yielding effects like Slonzcewsky resonances. In molecules this is usually a femtosecond timescale, which amounts to ultrafast (femtosecond) <b>internal</b> <b>conversion</b> processes, accompanied by broad spectral bands also under isolated-molecule conditions and highly complex spectral features.
