40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide some insights for developing a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university through democratizing the contemporary university management practices. The <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university has often the quality academic programs, quality teaching faculty members, and quality students for establishing high educational standards. The faculty of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities engages in <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> research and produce <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity of new knowledge and publications. The graduates of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities usually obtain <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> professional positions. They also generate the necessary physical and financial resources and endowments for supporting themselves. Those universities that develop these quality characteristics offer a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education. Democratization of the university management practices plays a key role for a university to develop a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university. In this study, democratization process includes the ownership, the practice of sharing the authority and responsibility, group decision-making, horizontal network organizational structure and long term employment practices of university management. Those universities utilizing these practices together and acting collectively as a team are able to achieve a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university. Democratization process will also help stakeholders of the university to establish close cooperation and relations with public and private institutions for financing the university...|$|R
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

A 2013 systematic review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E

5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo and Diana and Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the <b>highest</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E

Zayat authorized the <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the <b>highest</b> <b>quality,</b> to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how pharmaceutical costs for <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> drugs are shared between insurers and consumers. Who bears these costs {{has important implications}} for patient access to better drugs, and for differences in access to <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> pharmaceuticals. We investigate these issues using data from two large drug product classes: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antidepressants. We find that insurers shift the drug costs associated with <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> onto consumers for antidepressants but share in the costs of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> for NSAIDs. This suggests that patients’ cost burden, hence access, to <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> drugs may vary across drug product classes. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a model of}} vertical differentiation to evaluate the welfare effects of removing a low quality product from the market. The mechanism through which a welfare improvement might arise is simple: Once the low quality low cost alternative is banned, entry into the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> segment becomes more likely. This in turn {{may lead to a}} significant reduction in the price of the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> product. We find that such a ban might improve aggregate welfare when consumers value the <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> more, the marginal cost of producing <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> is lower, the price of low <b>quality</b> is <b>higher,</b> and the price sensitivity for <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> is not too high...|$|R

5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|The 1971 Five Nations Championship {{was a new}} dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and {{the team}} now into their Second Golden era were both {{experienced}} and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, {{and set up a}} Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the <b>highest</b> <b>quality.</b> Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> of workmanship.|$|E

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

Predictions from behavioural experiments that these fitness correlates would be lower when <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food is more heterogeneously distributed in space were tested but not supported either by laboratory or field experiments. To investigate whether A. vulgare can develop the ability to relocate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patches, changes in foraging behaviour, over a comparable time period to that used in the fitness experiments, were monitored in arenas {{in which there was}} a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patch in a low quality matrix. A. vulgare increased its ability to relocate the position of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food over time.
