Openness channel: a real appreciation does not favor exports and attract foreign direct investments, thereby a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>employment.</b> 3. Efficiency effect: a real appreciation exerts a pressure on efficiency improvement, thus a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>employment.</b> Using the panel data of the 29 Chinese provinces for the period from 1994 to 2002, the econometric results confirm {{the negative effects of}} the real appreciation of Renminbi <b>on</b> the manufacturing <b>employment.</b> The three channels are statistically significant, in which capital/labor intensity channel is more important. real exchange rate, employment, China...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the 18th century {{both the}} elite and common people would {{generally}} take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, {{at least in}} cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then {{at the forefront of the}} Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished.

50|$|Don Patinkin (1954) {{challenged}} the classical dichotomy as being inconsistent, {{with the introduction}} of the 'real balance effect' of changes in the nominal money supply. The early classical writers postulated that money is inherently equivalent in value to that quantity of real goods which it can purchase. Therefore, in Walrasian terms, a monetary expansion would raise prices by an equivalent amount, with no real <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>employment</b> or output. Patinkin postulated that this inflation could not come about without a corresponding disturbance in the goods market. As the money supply is increased, the real stock of money balances exceeds the 'ideal' level, and thus expenditure on goods is increased to re-establish the optimum balance. This raises the price level in the goods market, until the excess demand is satisfied, at the new equilibrium. He thus argued that the classical dichotomy was inconsistent, in that it did not explicitly allow for this adjustment in the goods market. Later writers (Archibald & Lipsey, 1958) argued that the dichotomy was perfectly consistent, as it did not attempt to deal with the 'dynamic' adjustment process, it merely stated the 'static' initial and final equilibria.|$|E
