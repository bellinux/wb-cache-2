40|$|Abstract. Much {{progress}} {{has recently been}} made in understanding and quantifying vertical mixing induced by double-diffusive instabil-ities such as fingering convection (usually called thermohaline convec-tion) and oscillatory double-diffusive convection (a process closely re-lated to semiconvection). This was prompted <b>in</b> <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> advances <b>in</b> supercomputing, which allow us to run Direct Numerical Simulations of these processes at parameter values approaching those relevant in stellar interiors, and <b>in</b> <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> recent theoretical developments in oceanography where such instabilities also occur. In this paper I sum-marize these recent findings, and propose new mixing parametrizations for both processes that can easily be implemented in stellar evolution codes. ...|$|R
