60|$|After some {{considerable}} confusion {{it was found}} that nothing was much damaged except the car, one shaft of which was broken altogether in two. Lady Clara's arm was bruised and rather sore, but the three other ladies had altogether escaped. The quantity of clothes that had been wrapped round them had no doubt enabled them to <b>fall</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sophia Furnival was, as I have said, a clever, {{attractive}} girl, handsome, well-read, able to {{hold her}} own with the old {{as well as with}} the young, capable of hiding her vanity if she had any, mild and gentle to girls less gifted, animated in conversation, and yet possessing an eye that could <b>fall</b> <b>softly</b> to the ground, as a woman's eye always should fall upon occasions.|$|E

60|$|He drew {{a little}} closer to the fire, and nobody said {{anything}} for a minute or two, though Hetty glanced towards the little window. The room was dim except when a blaze sprang up, and turning suddenly she stirred the fire, and then, for no very apparent reason, set herself to listen. The bush outside was very still, and she could hear the frost-dried snow <b>fall</b> <b>softly</b> from a branch. Then there was a sharp snapping of resinous wood in the fire, and it was not until that died away she heard a sound again. It was very faint, and suggested a soft crunching down of powdery snow. Nobody else seemed to hear it, not even the corporal, who was apparently examining a rent in his tunic just then, and she had almost persuaded herself that she had fancied it when she glanced towards the window again. A flickering blaze was roaring up the chimney now.|$|E

40|$|Gravity shapes us. From {{birth to}} death, what bodies {{can do is}} bound by what they weigh. Things <b>fall,</b> <b>softly</b> or heavily, {{constantly}} or all at once. Some things are too heavy to carry, or to lift. Some things carry us. Loaded combines an evocative original soundscape with texts ranging from ancient literature to modern science. Its eight performers use planks, sandbags as well as each other to explore how bodies and structures learn to bear loads – or fall apart. Violent, lyrical and funny, Loaded is a startling new show about the mechanics of weight {{and what happens when}} we face the limits of our strength. The production developed as part of the BA Acting Collaborative and Devised Theatre curriculum at Royal Central which pioneers new approaches to actor-training and theatre-making. Working {{for the first time on}} a dance-theatre show, graduates from the BA Hons in Acting CDT and BA Hons in Theatre Practice programmes collaborate with established, award-winning artists, Neil Bettles, Vicki Manderson and Colin Grenfell ([URL] Artist residencies at Ormiston Academy Trust (Jan-Oct 2017), The Place Theatre, London (Sept 2017) and The Old Rep Theatre, Birmingham (Oct 2017) are followed by four performances at The Old Rep from 5 - 6 October 2017.

60|$|I {{finished}} on a {{slow and}} stately rhythm, my voice rising and <b>falling</b> <b>softly,</b> after {{the manner of a}} Gregorian chant, as I dwelt on the piety that had succeeded the Lord of Pesaro's brave exploits, and how upon his return from the stricken field he had repaired straight to his closet, his battered and bloody harness on his back, that he might kneel ere he disarmed and render thanks to God for the victory vouchsafed him.|$|R

60|$|In Malaga, for me, {{there are}} dark churches, with massive, tall pillars; the light <b>falls</b> <b>softly</b> through the painted glass, regilding the golden woodwork, the angels and the saints and the bishops in their mitres.

Now and then I come across an old house with a {{fragment}} of Moorish work, reminding me that here again the Moors have left their mark.|$|R

60|$|Down, down, down he {{fell and}} sank through chill depths, <b>falling</b> slowly, <b>falling</b> <b>softly.</b> The cool waters passed; he floated through misty, shadowy space. An infinitude of silence {{enclosed}} him. Then a dim and sullen roar of waters {{came to his}} ears, borne faintly, then stronger, on a breeze that was not of earth. Anguish and despair tinged that sodden wind. Weird and terrible came a cry. Steaming, boiling, burning, rumbling chaos--a fearful rushing sullen water! Then {{a flash of light}} like a falling star sped out of the dark clouds.|$|R

60|$|A few light taps {{upon the}} pane made him {{turn to the}} window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the {{newspapers}} were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on {{every part of the}} dark central plain, on the treeless hills, <b>falling</b> <b>softly</b> upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, <b>softly</b> <b>falling</b> into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.|$|R

The lead guitar produced a quickly <b>falling</b> then <b>softly</b> ascending melody, with slight commercial influence.

6000|$|While Mary {{was feeling}} {{disappointed}} at his light tone, he changed {{it to one}} that was almost mournful. 'The worst of it is, that 'don't care' is my refuge.

60|$|The iron hand-gate {{which led}} from the park into his domain was {{suddenly}} opened and closed. The way led through a grove of trees and through another gate into the garden. He {{turned his head and}} watched the spot where the figure of his visitor must appear. It was curious that from the first, although his common sense should have told him how impossible such a thing was, he had an intuitive presentiment as to who this visitor might be. He laid down the unlighted cigar upon his table and leaned a little forward in his chair. First he heard footsteps <b>falling</b> <b>softly</b> upon a carpet of pine needles and yielding turf, slowly too, as though the movements of their owner were in a sense reluctant. And then a slim, tall figure in white--a familiar figure! He was up in a moment, striding forwards. She had already passed through the gate, however, and was moving towards him across the lawn.|$|R

60|$|A witching, gurgling, mirthful strain, like mingled {{bird and}} brook song, floated {{out on the}} still air, along the path where the red and golden maple leaves were <b>falling</b> very <b>softly,</b> one by one.

Even while they were thus engaged the storm burst on them with excessive violence. The snow which had been <b>falling</b> so <b>softly,</b> was caught up by the conflicting winds and hurled high into the air, or driven furiously over the valley in all directions, for the gale did not come from any fixed quarter; it rose and swooped and eddied about, driving the snow-drift now here, now there, and shrieking as if in wild delight at the chaotic havoc it was permitted to play.|$|R

6000|$|Returning {{in a new}} direction, {{we found}} {{ourselves}} once more walking on a high road, just as the sun had gone down, and the grey twilight was <b>falling</b> <b>softly</b> over the landscape. Stopping near a lonely farm-house, we went into a field to look at another old British monument to which our attention had been directed. We saw a square stone column--now broken into two pieces--ornamented with a curiously carved pattern, and exhibiting an inscription cut in irregular, mysterious characters. Those who have deciphered them, have discovered that the column is nearly a thousand years old; that it was raised as a sepulchral monument over the body of Dungerth King of Cornwall; and that the letters carved on it form some Latin words, which may be thus translated:--"PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF DUNGERTH." [...] Seen {{in the dim light}} of the last quiet hour of evening, there was something solemn and impressive about the appearance of the old tombstone--simple though it was. After leaving it, we soon entered once more into regions of fertility. Cottages, cornfields, and trees surrounded us again. We passed through pleasant little valleys; over brooks crossed by quaint wooden bridges; up and down long lanes, where tall hedges and clustering trees darkened the way--where the stag-beetle flew slowly by, winding [...] "his small but sullen horn," [...] and glow-worms glimmered brightly in the long, dewy grass by the roadside. The moon, rising at first red and dull in a misty sky, brightened as we went on, and lighted us brilliantly along all that remained of our night-walk back to the town.|$|R
