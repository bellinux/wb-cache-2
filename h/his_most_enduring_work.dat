500|$|In 1856, the Atlantic or Saturday Club {{was created}} to launch and support The Atlantic Monthly. This new {{magazine}} was edited by Holmes's friend James Russell Lowell, and articles were contributed by the New England literary elite such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Lothrop Motley and J. Elliot Cabot. Holmes not only provided its name, but also wrote various pieces for the journal throughout the years. For the magazine's first issue, Holmes produced {{a new version of}} two of his earlier essays, [...] "The Autocrat at the Breakfast-Table". Based upon fictionalized breakfast table talk and including poetry, stories, jokes and songs, the work was favored by readers and critics alike and it secured the initial success of The Atlantic Monthly. The essays were collected as a book of the same name in 1858 and became <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work,</b> selling ten thousand copies in three days. Its sequel, The Professor at the Breakfast-Table, was released shortly after beginning in serialized installments in January 1859.|$|E
500|$|Keshiraja was {{a notable}} writer and grammarian of the 13thcentury. He {{came from a}} family of famous poet-writers. Although five of Keshiraja's {{writings}} are not traceable, <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> on Kannada grammar, Shabdamanidarpana ("Mirror of Word Jewels", 1260), is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste. True to his wish that his writing on grammar should [...] "last as long as the sun, the moon, the oceans and the Meru mountain lasted", Shabdamanidarpana is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old Kannada grammar. It is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post-graduate studies in the Kannada language. Although Keshiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar (of the Katantra school) and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar (by King Amoghavarsha I of the 9thcentury and grammarian Nagavarma II of 1145), his work has originality. Keshiraja's lost writings are Cholapalaka Charitam, Sri Chitramale, Shubhadraharana, Prabodhachandra and Kiratam (or Kiratarjuniyam).|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is {{a humorous}} piece, The Jolly Old Pedagogue.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works</b> is the Method for the {{chromatic}} horn, or horn with pistons (1840).|$|R
5000|$|One of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> Snow-Bound, {{was first}} {{published}} in 1866. Whittier was surprised by its financial success; he earned $10,000 from the first edition. In 1867, Whittier asked James Thomas Fields to get him a ticket to a reading by Charles Dickens during the British author's visit to the United States. After the event, Whittier wrote a letter describing his experience: ...|$|R
50|$|His first bestseller, Factories in the Field, {{appeared}} in 1939 and ranks among <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works.</b> Published {{within months of}} John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, it examines the lives of migrant farm workers in California and condemns the politics and consequences of large-scale agribusiness. Shortly before its publication, McWilliams accepted an offer from incoming Governor Culbert Olson to head California's Division of Immigration and Housing. Over his four-year term (1938-1942), he focused on improving agricultural working conditions and wages, but his hopes for major reform deteriorated {{with the advent of}} World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The hymn {{he wrote}} on his honeymoon, [...] "Angels holy, high and lowly," [...] {{has been called}} <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
50|$|Probably <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is the {{critical}} edition of William of Ockham's Opera omnia theologica et philosophica, which he produced with Professor Ernest Moody.|$|E

50|$|Nijaguna Shivayogi (15th century) was an Indian {{poet and}} a {{prolific}} {{writer in the}} Kannada language. He lived in the 15th century. He was a follower of the Veerashaiva faith (devotee of the Hindu god Shiva), which he attempted to reconcile with the Advaita Hinduism of Adi Shankaracharya. Tradition has it that Shivayogi was a petty chieftain of Kollegal taluk in modern Mysore district of Karnataka state, India. Considered a visionary of his time, his Vivekachintamani, written in encyclopaedic proportions and in prose style, and the Kaivalya Paddhati, a musical treatise consisting of songs are considered <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1843 Aksakov {{settled in}} the village of Abramtsevo, where he entertained writers {{including}} Gogol, Turgenev, and Tolstoy and which was also frequented by his Slavophile sons, Konstantin and Ivan. In the late 1850s he published <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> The Family Chronicle (Semeinaya khronika, 1856; translated as A Russian Gentleman) and Childhood Years of Bagrov Grandson (Detskie gody Bagrova-vnuka, 1858, translated as Years of Childhood). These reminiscences of a childhood spent in a Russian patriarchal family [...] "brought Aksakov recognition as a literary artist of the first rank." [...] Aksakov's semi-autobiographical narratives are unmatched for their scrupulous and detailed description of the everyday life of the Russian nobility.|$|R
50|$|Straus' best-known {{works are}} Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream), and The Chocolate Soldier (Der tapfere Soldat). The waltz {{arrangement}} {{from the former}} is probably <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> orchestral <b>work.</b> Among <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous songs is the theme song from the 1950 film La Ronde.|$|R
50|$|He {{produced}} commentaries {{and histories}} of the Israelites and the Near East, but <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was his critical edition of the Hebrew scriptures, Biblia Hebraica, which has remained a standard text.|$|E
50|$|Because it was {{uncommon}} for Charles Sawyer to stage scenes, Sawyer images with people or animals are rare. Interiors are also uncommon. His preference for capturing and presenting landscapes was validated by sales in his lifetime; and landscapes {{have also been}} <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From 1974 to 1980, {{he worked}} as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs staff photographer. Some of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> came from this period, as he visited {{indigenous}} communities and documented [...] "the first flush of an idealistic era when land rights, equal wages and government-funded aid seemed to presage a new dawn for Aboriginal Australians".|$|E
50|$|In 1956 he {{was invited}} by Thomas Armstrong to join {{the staff of the}} Royal Academy of Music, where he would teach for the best part of thirty years. A few years later he took a {{part-time}} job as Director of Music at St Paul's Girls' School, following Gustav Holst and Herbert Howells, and was for a time Director of Music at Morley College. These teaching posts led to the composition of some of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> and together with the many holiday courses he worked on as a conductor (Canford, Dartington, ESSYM, Bernard Robinson's Music Camp, etc.) ensured {{that he was able to}} bring practical experience and knowledge to bear on his compositions.|$|R
50|$|Freed {{was also}} active as a synagogue {{musician}}, acting as organist and choirmaster at Temple Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. His {{work as a}} synagogue musician led him to compose Jewish liturgical works, beginning with his Sacred Service for Shabbat Morning, published in 1939. Many {{feel that this is}} <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> musical <b>work.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{works that}} Brooks {{published}} were poems and short stories. Among {{the latter were}} a series (from 1937) of short stories featuring [...] "a talking horse and his drunken owner"; it {{was the basis for}} a 1960s television comedy series Mister Ed. (Credit is given in each episode to [...] "Walter Brooks" [...] for creating the characters. Brooks himself had died by the time that production began on the show; as of early November 2013, it was not known whether his estate collected royalties from its production.) <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> however, are the 26 books that he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends. Boucher and McComas, for example, praised Freddy and the Spaceship, saying that it [...] "offers wit, sound structural plotting, genuine character-humor, and admirable English prose".|$|R
50|$|Joyce {{was a key}} {{cultural}} {{figure of}} his time. His wide interests included the Irish language, Hiberno-English, music, education, Irish literature and folklore, Irish history and antiquities, place-names and much else. He produced many works on the history and culture of Ireland. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is the pioneering The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places (first edition published in 1869).|$|E
50|$|John Maxson Stillman (1852-1923) was {{a pioneer}} {{of the history of}} science in the United States. He was also the first head of the {{chemistry}} department at Stanford University, as well as its first Chemistry Professor. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was the posthumously published book The Story of Early Chemistry, decades later republished as The Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1990s, Marlowe {{appeared}} as Al Brackman twice on Matlock, on Father Dowling Mysteries and on Jake and the Fatman. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> {{in the decade}} was in 1994 with 65 appearances as Michael Burke on the night-time soap opera Valley of the Dolls. In 1995, he {{appeared as}} Avery Nugent in the episode [...] "School for Murder" [...] on Murder She Wrote.|$|E
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Mexican novelist Justo Sierra O'Reilly, who is {{credited}} with inspiring his son with the spirit of literature. Sierra moved to Mexico City at the age of 13 in 1861, the year of his father's death, and also, coincidentally, the year of the French intervention in Mexico. Together with his fellow young students, Sierra responded with patriotic fervor to the invasion of his country, and became a lifelong militant liberal. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works</b> are sociopolitical histories (at times verging on memoirs) of the era of Benito Juárez and Porfirio Díaz, particularly his political biography of Juárez and his Evolución política del pueblo mexicano. Antonio Caso considered the definitive statement of the age of the Reform in Mexico. Sierra was elected a member of the Mexican Academy of Language in 1887, and served as the Academy's sixth director from 1910 until his death in 1912.|$|R
25|$|This second Paris period {{produced}} {{several important}} theoretical writings. Cours de composition musicale, published by 1818, became the standard text on composition at the Conservatoire; the Traité de mélodie of 1814, a treatise on melody, was also widely studied. Another semi-didactic work, 34 Études for piano, {{was published by}} 1817. It was also in Paris that Reicha started composing the 25 wind quintets which proved to be <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works</b> (far more conservative musically than the experimental fugues he had written in Vienna, but exploiting the skill of his virtuosi from the Opéra Comique to extend significantly the technique and musical ambitions of future players of the still evolving wind instruments). In 1818 he married Virginie Enaust, who bore him two daughters. In 1819 he began teaching harmony and music theory to Louise Farrenc; after interrupting her studies for her own marriage, she completed studies at the Paris Conservatory with Reicha in 1825.|$|R
5000|$|His {{poems are}} {{distinguished}} {{by a sense}} of harmony and sympathy with natural beauty. Such poems as [...] "The Bridal of the Year," [...] "Summer Longings" [...] (alias [...] "Waiting for the May"), and his long narrative poem, [...] "The Voyage of St. Brendan," [...] are among <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works.</b> The last-mentioned, which paraphrases the [...] "Ave Maria Stella" [...] as the evening song of the sailors, is also marked by the earnest religious feeling which marked its author throughout life. But it is by his version of Calderon that he is considered to have won a permanent place in English letters. His success is sufficiently testified by George Ticknor, who declared in his History of Spanish Literature that MacCarthy [...] "has succeeded in giving a faithful idea of what is grandest and most effective in Calderon's genius... to a degree which I had previously thought impossible. Nothing, I think, in the English language will give us so true an impression of what is most characteristic of the Spanish drama, and of Spanish poetry generally." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is his {{critical}} {{edition of}} The Apology of Sir Thomas More, published in 1979 {{as part of}} the Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. He also published a volume of Essays in the Renaisssance and Classical Tradition (1990) and Studies of Petrarch and His Influence (2003). With Lotte Hellinga he was co-editor of The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, 1400-1557 (1999).|$|E
50|$|At the time, {{he moved}} to Chicago and was {{eventually}} married three more times. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is the short-story sequence Winesburg, Ohio, which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, Dark Laughter (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in New Orleans during the 1920s, was the only bestseller of his career.|$|E
50|$|Almerindo Spadetta (c.1822 - April 1894) was a {{prolific}} opera librettist active in Naples. He {{worked as a}} stage manager at the Teatro San Carlo, Teatro Nuovo, and Teatro del Fondo in Naples for over 40 years and wrote numerous libretti (mostly in the opera buffa genre) for composers associated with those theatres. <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was the libretto for Nicola De Giosa's Don Checco, {{one of the last}} great successes in the history of Neapolitan opera buffa.|$|E
25|$|Between 1830 and 1847, Berlioz wrote many of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> {{popular and}} <b>enduring</b> <b>works.</b> The {{foremost}} {{of these are}} the Symphonie fantastique (1830), Harold en Italie (1834), the Grande messe des morts (Requiem) (1837) and Roméo et Juliette (1839).|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} the poem came from Longfellow's friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. Longfellow used dactylic hexameter, imitating Greek and Latin classics, though the choice was criticized. It became Longfellow's most famous work in his {{lifetime}} and remains one of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> popular and <b>enduring</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Voltaire {{perceived}} the French bourgeoisie {{to be too}} small and ineffective, the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses. Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures {{of the time and}} the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king's rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> <b>his</b> novella Candide, ou l'Optimisme (Candide, or Optimism, 1759), which ends with a new conclusion: [...] "It is up to us to cultivate our garden." [...] <b>His</b> <b>most</b> polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. Candide was also burned and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain 'Demad' in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.|$|R
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was the {{building}} of a new church in Civita (modern Olbia), where he made his capital, in honour of Saint Simplicius, a sixth-century bishop and martyr of the city. Torchitorio also invited monks from Saint-Victor at Marseilles to come to Gallura in 1089, in imitation of his contemporary Torchitorio I of Cagliari. He granted the new monks four churches and they in turn opened up new lines of intellectual and economic interchange with Provence.|$|E
50|$|Antonio Joseph Bazzini (11 March 181810 February 1897) was an Italian violinist, {{composer}} and teacher. As a composer <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> is his chamber music which has {{earned him a}} central place in the Italian instrumental renaissance of the 19th century. However his success as a composer was overshadowed by his {{reputation as one of}} the finest concert violinists of the nineteenth century. He also contributed to a portion of Messa per Rossini, specifically the first section of II. Sequentia, Dies Irae.|$|E
5000|$|Toomer's {{appearance}} was [...] "racially indeterminate". As noted above, {{he lived in}} {{both black and white}} societies as he was growing up and during his life. He {{did not want to be}} bound by race and claimed to be an American and represent a new mixed culture. Given his wide experiences, he resisted being classified as a Negro writer. But, <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was Cane, inspired by his time in the rural South and the imaginative exploration of the early world of his absent father.|$|E
40|$|Born in 1934 as {{a member}} of the Yoruba people, Akinwande Oluwole Soyinka {{achieved}} early success as a playwright. After earning a degree in drama from the University of Leeds, in England, he founded theater companies in Nigeria and produced several of his own works, including A Dance of the Forests, which drew the ire of intellectuals and government authorities alike for its critique of post-colonial Africa. During his country’s civil war, Soyinka’s calls for peace led to his incarceration in solitary confinement from 1967 to 1969, an experience he chronicles in Poems from Prison and the memoir The Man Died. A period of exile in the 1970 s saw the creation of many of <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>works,</b> including the novelSeason of Anomy; two highly regarded tragedies, Madmen and Specialists and Death and the King’s Horseman; and his principal critical work, Myth, Literature, and the African World, which examines the role of the artist in the light of Yoruba mythology and belief. Soyinka has written several autobiographical works, including the childhood memoir Aké and You Must Set Forth at Dawn, which chronicles the writer’s exile from his homeland. In 1986, Wole Soyinka became the first African writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature...|$|R
50|$|Pope Pius II (Pius PP. II, Pio II), born Enea Silvio Bartolomeo Piccolomini (Aeneas Silvius Bartholomeus; 18 October 1405 - 14 August 1464) was Pope from 19 August 1458 to {{his death}} in 1464. He was born at Corsignano in the Sienese {{territory}} of a noble but impoverished family. <b>His</b> longest and <b>most</b> <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> {{is the story of}} his life, the Commentaries, which is the only autobiography ever written by a reigning pope.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} and <b>enduring</b> <b>work</b> was {{the founding of}} Yangon. After he conquered a pagoda village of Dagon in 1755, he added settlements with people from his home region. (The Mu-valley place names like Ahlon and Kyaukmyaung still endure to this date in Yangon.) By {{the eve of the}} First Anglo-Burmese War, Yangon had replaced Syriam (Thanlyin) as the chief port city of the kingdom.|$|R
