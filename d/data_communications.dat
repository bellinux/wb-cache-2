5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, <b>data</b> <b>communications</b> are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} all these idiosyncrasies, between 1968 and about 1980, a Selectric-based printer was a {{relatively}} inexpensive and fairly popular way to get high-quality output from a computer. A minor industry developed to support small businesses and leading-edge hobbyists who would obtain a Selectric mechanism (which cost much less than a full-fledged 2741 terminal) and modify it to interface with industry-standard serial <b>data</b> <b>communications.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1981 Zohar Zisapel {{resigned}} {{from his position}} at the Ministry of Defense and, together with Yehuda, founded RAD <b>Data</b> <b>Communications</b> Ltd. Operating from small, cramped quarters {{in the back of}} Bynet’s offices, Zohar oversaw the development of RAD’s first product, a miniature modem that would revolutionize the industry. The modems that were then on the market were the size of pizza boxes. RAD’s modem, however, could fit into one’s hand, and, remarkably, it did not require an independent power source, having been designed to operate instead by utilizing power flowing over the telephone line. One version of this modem, SRM-3, would be recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the smallest ever manufactured. Within two years of its founding, RAD had become a profitable international manufacturer of access solutions for <b>data</b> <b>communications</b> and telecommunications applications. In 1987 the company had reached $10 million in annual sales. RAD won the Israel Export Prize in 1993, the year in which its sales first exceeded $50 million. It surpassed the $100 million mark in global sales in 1996.|$|E
