500|$|Because of its {{depiction}} of teenage violence, A Clockwork Orange {{became one of}} the most controversial films of the decade, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema. It received an X-rated certificate upon release, just before Christmas in 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than Straw Dogs, which had been released a month earlier. Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick's death, and not re-released until 2000. John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered A Clockwork Orange to be [...] "perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I've ever seen, and believed it to present an [...] "intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle" [...] in its {{depiction of}} violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. Negative media hype over the film notwithstanding, A Clockwork Orange received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the New York Film Critics Circle as the Best Film of 1971. After William Friedkin won Best Director for The French Connection that year, he told the press: [...] "Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year.

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

5000|$|Mendhausen is a {{classical}} Frankish scattered village with {{a church in}} the middle. It was originally surrounded by walls for threatening times, called Gaden (storage rooms). In 1796 the village had 280 inhabitants, with 69 hearths (households). The troubled times, especially during the 30 Years War, reduced the population by more than 60%. The story that probably started in the 7th or 8th century is not known exactly. Mendhausen {{was probably one of}} the three Höchheims which history started in 783 (Great Hoechheim = those of the present Hoechheim, Small Hoechheim = Mönchshof) with the Frankish nobles, the Countess Emhilt, that <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> a number of possessions and [...] "property" [...] the of her founded Kloster Milz made over. 799 they inherited the possessions and the Kloster of Milz to the Bonifaciuskloster Fulda.The first Attribution [...] "Mentehusen" [...] comes from a deed of 1156 (Count Poppo of Irmelshausen, a Henneberger line).

40|$|Gary Hamel is {{well known}} for his forthright and {{challenging}} views on international corporate strategy. Together with his colleague, C. K.

Interviewed in London by EMJ's Editor, Paul Stonham, he emphasises that inter-corporate competition underlies his view of strategy. Companies compete in three ways [...] building core competencies that give products and services unique functionality; building a worldwide distribution and brand infrastructure; and creating product integrity disciplines. It is the first of these [...] functionality-enhancing competencies [...] that will distinguish the winning companies of the future. Hamel explores core competence further, pointing out that it provides logic for the corporation. He also argues that strategy should be 'stretch' not 'fit', competition should shape industry futures rather than merely position within existing industry boundaries, and resources should be leveraged rather than allocated. Business schools could also benefit from re-examining their core competencies. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{tutorial}} on {{the properties of}} the new ideal circuit element, a memristor.

The properties of these three elements and their circuits {{are a part of the}} standard curricula. The existence of the memristor as the fourth ideal circuit element was predicted in 1971 based on symmetry arguments, but was clearly experimentally demonstrated <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> We present the properties of a single memristor, memristors in series and parallel, as well as ideal memristor-capacitor (MC), memristor-inductor (ML), and memristor-capacitor-inductor (MCL) circuits. We find that the memristor has hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. We show that the ideal MC (ML) circuit undergoes non-exponential charge (current) decay with two time-scales, and that by switching the polarity of the capacitor, an ideal MCL circuit can be tuned from overdamped to underdamped. We present simple models which show that these unusual properties are closely related to the memristor's internal dynamics.
