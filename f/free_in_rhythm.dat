50|$|Some palos such as granaínas, malagueñas, and fandango libre, are {{rendered}} <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> {{whereas most}} others are metered, that is, in compás.

5000|$|Meditations is a 1966 album by John Coltrane. The {{album was}} {{considered}} the [...] "spiritual follow-up to A Love Supreme." [...] It features Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders as soloists, both playing tenor saxophones. Much of the recording is avant-garde, featuring extensive passages <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm</b> and extended saxophone techniques such as honked and overblown notes, as well as multiphonics. This {{would be the last}} Coltrane recording with long-time partners drummer Elvin Jones and pianist McCoy Tyner.|$|R

The spiral section returns in the brass and also in the coda, which brings the work to an exciting finish. The final movement lasts approximately nine minutes.|$|R

5000|$|Scott {{was called}} the [...] "Father of modern British music" [...] by Eugene Goossens, and was also {{appreciated}} by Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, his close friend Percy Grainger, Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky. His experiments <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> generated by expanding musical motifs, above all in his First Piano Sonata of 1909, appear to have exerted an influence on Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring [...] He {{used to be known}} as 'the English Debussy', though this reflected little knowledge of Scott and little understanding of Debussy.|$|R
25|$|Compositions more {{commonly}} associated with Indian classical dance and Indian devotional music have also been increasingly used in the Carnatic music repertoire. The performance of the Sanskrit sloka, Tamil viruttam and Telugu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique. Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses, musicians improvise raga phrases <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> like an alapana, so both the sound value, {{and the meaning of}} the text, guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations. Forms such as the divya prabandham, thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly, however, these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama, javali, padam, thillana and thiruppugazh forms.|$|R
40|$|There is to date no {{comprehensive}} {{account of}} the rhythms of free verse. The main purpose of A Prosody of <b>Free</b> Verse: explorations <b>in</b> <b>rhythm</b> is to fill that gap and begin to provide a systematic approach to describing and analyzing free verse rhythms. Most studies have declared the attempt to write such a prosody as impossible: they prefer to see free verse as an aberrant version of regular metrical verse. They also believe that behind free verse is the ‘ghost of metre’. Running against that current, A Prosody of Free Verse bases its new system on additive rhythms that do not fit conventional time signatures. Inspiration is taken from jazz, contemporary music and dance, not only in their systems of notation but in performance. The book argues that twentieth and twenty-first century <b>rhythms</b> <b>in</b> poetry as based on the line rather than the metrical foot as the unit of rhythm, and that larger rhythmic structures fall into verse paragraphs rather than stanzas...|$|R
25|$|Western composers {{have noticed}} that the <b>rhythm</b> <b>in</b> a piece of qin music can change; once {{they seem to have}} got a beat, the beats change. This {{is due to the fact}} that qin players may use some <b>free</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>in</b> their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how he interprets the piece. However, some melodies have {{sections}} of fixed rhythm which is played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.|$|R

40|$|This book {{presents}} the vocal art music of Kabul as performed by Ustad Amir Mohammad. At {{the heart of}} Kabul's vocal art music is the ghazal, a highly flexible song form using Persian (or Pashto) texts derived {{from a variety of}} sources. Much of this poetry is in the Sufi tradition, with frequent metaphoric allusions to love, wine and intoxication. In musical terms, the Kabuli ghazal style is related to ghazal singing in India and Pakistan, but the setting of the texts to music is distinctly Afghan, with interpolated couplets sung <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>rhythm,</b> fast instrumental sections and dramatic rhythmic cadences. As befits a Sufi music, it has a regularly repeated cyclical structure with trance-inducing properties. Central to the book is the audio CD, containing six ghazals, one mosammat and one Afghan-style tarâna, all recorded by John Baily between 1974 and 1976 in the city of Herat, in western Afghanistan. At that time Ustad Amir Mohammad was Herat's most sought-after singer in the Kabuli style, playing mainly at wedding parties of wealthy Heratis. In these valuable recordings he is accompanied by two outstanding local musicians, Rahim Khushnawaz on rubâb, and Gada Mohammad on dutâr...|$|R

Charlie Porter from Amazon.co.uk was positive towards the remix, stating [...] "Brothers <b>In</b> <b>Rhythm</b> work their slinky magic on [...] "Too Far"...". Porter highlighted the song as an album stand out track. Brendan Swift from AllMusic was mixed {{in his review}} from Impossible Remixes, which the Brothers <b>in</b> <b>Rhythm</b> remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] was included on. He commented that [...] "with ten versions of four songs ("Too Far", [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", [...] "Did it Again", and [...] "Breathe"), there's {{not a lot of}} room for variation... and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder." [...] However, Swift acknowledge that Brothers <b>in</b> <b>Rhythm,</b> and other remix artists from the two accompanying albums, [...] "do their best to mix it up, and they succeed by drip-drying the pop melodies and distilling them into pure club-style mash." [...] Despite an airplay and vinyl release, the Brothers <b>in</b> <b>Rhythm</b> remix failed to appear on any record charts. No music video was directed or produced.|$|R
