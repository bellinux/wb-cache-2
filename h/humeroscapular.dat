40|$|Motion {{between the}} humerus and scapula {{commonly}} {{is described as}} glenohumeral motion. However, <b>humeroscapular</b> motion occurs at two distinct sites. In addition to the motion at the diarthrodial glenohumeral joint, movement occurs between the proximal humerus and related structures and the surrounding sleeve of structures, including the acromion, deltoid, coracoid, coracoacromial ligament, and the muscles attached to the coracoid. This site of nonarticular shoulder motion {{is defined as the}} <b>humeroscapular</b> motion interface. Nonarticular <b>humeroscapular</b> motion can be documented and measured using standard magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The maximum average interfacial motion using axial images was 29. 1 mm, which occurred {{at the level of the}} maximum diameter of the humeral head. Interfacial motion varied depending on the site measured. If pathologic conditions such as adhesions secondary to trauma or surgery interfere with or obliterate this space at sites of significant sliding motion, overall shoulder motion will be limited. Successful treatment of shoulder stiffness related to <b>humeroscapular</b> restraints is likely to require restoration of the normal sliding motion at the <b>humeroscapular</b> motion interface, in addition to resolving restraints affecting the glenohumera...|$|E

40|$|Periarthritis of the {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most common}} cause of <b>humeroscapular</b> pain. The term “scapulohumeral periarthritis” encompasses injuries of both the muscles and the joint capsule proper. It is more justified to differentiate periarticular lesions from rotator cuff pathology and injury of the capsule proper (frozen shoulder) in daily clinical practice. The diagnosis is generally based on clinical data. Medical therapy is effective in the vast majority of cases; surgery is performed as specially indicated. The best results are yielded by combination treatment for scapulohumeral periarthrosis, which encompasses pharmacotherapy (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, periarticular injection of glucocorticoids and local anesthetics) and non-pharmacological therapies (manual therapy with high-amplitude joint mobilization, post-isometric relaxation, and active exercises). </p...|$|E
40|$|Definition. -A {{diagnosis}} of peri-arthritis {{of the shoulder}} is made when a patient exhibits pain {{in the region of}} the shoulder and limited mobility of the joint, apparently of spontaneous onset or following slight injury. The x-ray appearances may show either nothing abnormal or calcific deposits in the capsule or peri-articular tissue. This syndrome is not a disease sui generis, since the underlying pathological changes may no doubt affect either,the joint capsule or the peri-articular tissue. Peri-arthritis of the shoulder, therefore, is a collective term for a number of different lesions of the shoulder, the only common features being pain and limitation of movement in the shoulder joint. A common term may be used for the time being because the clinical features, regardless of the site ofthe morbid changes, which can hardly be determined without biopsy, are more or less uniform. Previous Suggestions regarding the Causes of Peri-Arthritis of the Shoulder Since Duplay (1872) described the syndrome as <b>humeroscapular</b> peri-arthritis, a numbe...|$|E
40|$|Studies in dermatology, {{cutaneous}} pharmacology, and toxicology utilize {{skin from}} different animal species and body sites. However, regional differences exist in topical chemical percutaneous absorption studies in man and in animals. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare epidermal thickness and number of cell layers across species and body sites using both formalin-fixed paraffin and frozen sections. Cutaneous blood flow determined by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) was compared to histologic data. Six animals of each of the following species were used: monkeys, pigs, dogs, cats, cows, horses, rabbits, rats, and mice. Cutaneous blood flow was determined and 6 -mm skin biopsies were taken directly from the following sites: buttocks, ear, <b>humeroscapular</b> joint, thoracolumbar junction, and abdominal area. When the two histologic methods were compared across all species and body sites, the thickness of the epidermis was significantly greater, and the thickness of the stratum corneum significantly less, in paraffin sections versus frozen sections (p 0. 05) to epidermal or stratum corneum thickness. However, regional and species differences were noted in all these parameters. In conclusion, these data indicate that thickness and LDV blood flow are independent and must be evaluated separately when comparisons are made between species and body sites. This work provides a data base for future comparative studies in which a knowledge of skin thickness or blood flow might be important variables...|$|E
40|$|Short stature, {{auditory}} canal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, and skeletal abnormalities (SAMS) {{has been reported}} previously to be a rare, autosomal-recessive developmental disorder with other, unique rhizomelic skeletal anomalies. These include bilateral humeral hypoplasia, <b>humeroscapular</b> synostosis, pelvic abnormalities, and proximal defects of the femora. To identify the genetic basis of SAMS, we used molecular karyotyping and whole-exome sequencing (WES) to study small, unrelated families. Filtering of variants from the WES data included segregation analysis followed by comparison of in-house exomes. We identified a homozygous 306 kb microdeletion and homozygous predicted null mutations of GSC, encoding Goosecoid homeobox protein, a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor. This confirms that SAMS is a human malformation syndrome resulting from GSC mutations. Previously, Goosecoid {{has been shown to}} be a determinant at the Xenopus gastrula organizer region and a segment-polarity determinant in Drosophila. In the present report, we present data on Goosecoid protein localization in staged mouse embryos. These data and the SAMS clinical phenotype both suggest that Goosecoid is a downstream effector of the regulatory networks that define neural-crest cell-fate specification and subsequent mesoderm cell lineages in mammals, particularly during shoulder and hip formation. Our findings confirm that Goosecoid has an essential role in human craniofacial and joint development and suggest that Goosecoid is an essential regulator of mesodermal patterning in mammals and that it has specific functions in neural crest cell derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. ”Overhead” sports, {{characterized}} by predominant {{movements of the}} hands above the head, are associated with very dynamic, often acyclic movements and require strong muscles of <b>humeroscapular</b> regions with high mobility of the shoulder joint as well as flexibility and ability to relax these muscles. This study was aimed at analyzing the shoulder joint mobility before and after conducting kinesiology treatment {{for a period of}} 6 months. The research included two complex exercises. Material and methods. The study included 100 ”overhead” sports male athletes, who were randomly divided into the experimental and control group, aged 14 to 18 years. The range of motion was measured in degrees by goniometer. We calculated the central and depression parameter. Results. There was a statistically significant difference in flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external and internal rotation at the final measure in favor of the experimental group at the level of significance p< 0. 001, and some positive effects of the applied exercises were observed. Discussion. Kinesitherapy had positive effects on the elasticity of the connective tissue capsule, ligaments and tendons. Changes in the shoulder area of the ”overhead” sports athletes can be reduced to the same extent {{and at the same time}} by stretching and strength exercises. Conclusion. The authors of this paper have given their modest contribution by suggesting a more appropriate planning of training and performance of players at training and matches. This paper tries to emphasize the importance of proper incorporation of the corrective exercises in training...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -year-old, entire female, German Shepherd Dog was {{referred}} with a 3 -month history of right foreleg lameness that partially responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapy. The bitch lost weight, was polydipsic and had reduced exercise tolerance. On referral, {{the animal was}} in poor condition, pyrexic and exhibited moderate pain on full extension of the right shoulder. Blood, urine and joint fluid were obtained and radiographs were taken of the right shoulder and chest. The bitch was lymphopaenic, hyperfibrinogenaemic, hyperglobulinaemic, mildly azotaemic, mildly proteinuric and isosthenuric. Branching fungal hyphae {{were present in the}} urine. On radiography, the thorax contained a large ventral mediastinal mass and the humeral head had extensive areas of radiolucency. An aspirate from the right <b>humeroscapular</b> joint exhibited branched fungal hyphae and numerous neutrophils and macrophages. A diagnosis of disseminated mycosis was made and euthanasia was performed. At necropsy, numerous caseating granulomas were present, especially in the kidneys, adrenal glands, heart and lymph nodes. Extensive osteomyelitis involved the head of the right humerus, the sternebrae and the fifth intervertebral disc. Fungal hyphae were detected in sections of granulomas in all affected organs and a diagnosis of disseminated fungal granulomatosis was made. Aspergillus deflectus was readily isolated from affected lymph nodes, but confirming its identity as A deflectus using standard procedures proved difficult. The identity of the fungus was finally confirmed by sequencing part of the 185 rRNA of the isolate. This is the first report in Australia of a disseminated mycosis caused by A deflectus. Previously, the involvement of A deflectus as a cause of disseminated mycosis was limited to 5 cases from the West Coast of the USA, four of which occurred in German Shepherd Dogs...|$|E

Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias A. V. Sivozhelezov, N. A. Sykal, V. V. Chugaj, A. A. Tonkoglas Kharkov national medical university Abstract The problem of surgical treatment of inguinal hernias over the last 25 years has gone through global changing. Tension free correction of defects of the anterior abdominal wall with using of synthetic prostheses are now the undisputed favorites in the treatment of inguinal hernias. After Lichtenstein operation, Laparoscopic hernia repair now occupies the second place in the structure of operations for inguinal hernias. In 2011, laparoscopic hernioplasty TAPP were performed on 149 patient. The authors did not mention severe intra- or postoperative complications, as well as the conversion to open surgery at failure during laparoscopic surgery. From intraoperative complications they met more often bleeding (4). The greatest technical difficulties arose in damage of inferior epigastric vessels. In the postoperative period they met next complication: the most frequent groin hematoma (4), neuralgia (2) and paresthesias (5), pain in <b>humeroscapular</b> area (4). The laparoscopic techniques of hernia repair are effective, pathogenetically substantiated, provides a comfortable postoperative period and the possibility of early rehabilitation.
