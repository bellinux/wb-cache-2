5|$|Hurricane <b>Dolly</b> caused {{flooding}} throughout Mexico in August1996. The fourth named {{storm and}} third hurricane of the season, <b>Dolly</b> developed from a tropical wave to the west-southwest of Jamaica on August19. Initially a tropical depression, the system strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} about twelve hours later. <b>Dolly</b> headed westward and intensified into a Category1 hurricane late on August20. It then made landfall near Chetumal, Quintana Roo. The system weakened to a tropical depression on August21. Later that day or early on August22, <b>Dolly</b> emerged into the Bay of Campeche and quickly re-strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm deepened further and was upgraded to a hurricane again by midday on August23; <b>Dolly</b> simultaneously peaked with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Around that time, it struck between Tuxpan, Veracruz, and Tampico, Tamaulipas. <b>Dolly</b> quickly weakened to a tropical depression early on August24, but remained intact while crossing Mexico and dissipated over the eastern Pacific Ocean on August25.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dolly</b> {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds. As a result, the United States Air Force ordered {{all of the}} planes on the island to fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, <b>Dolly</b> passed over the island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of <b>Dolly</b> later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Dolly</b> was a {{short-lived}} and disorganized tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across Tamaulipas, Mexico, in early September2014. Originating from a tropical wave, the system first became a tropical depression late on September1 while situated over the Bay of Campeche. <b>Dolly</b> struggled against strong wind shear {{for the duration}} of its existence. The large system featured multiple circulations, sometimes becoming a new dominant center and other times simply rotating around a mean vortex. As a result, multiple center relocations occurred along its general west-northwest track. <b>Dolly</b> eventually made landfall in Tamaulipas on September3 before degenerating into a remnant low. The system subsequently dissipated the following day.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dollies</b> serve one-year terms, {{and each}} year five new dancers are chosen by {{previous}} <b>Dollies</b> and the band.

50|$|<b>Dollies</b> for loose baggage {{are used}} for the {{transportation}} of loose baggages, oversized bags, mail bags, loose cargo carton boxes, etc. between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. <b>Dollies</b> for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug. Most <b>dollies</b> for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather. In the US, these <b>dollies</b> are called Baggage Cart, but in Europe Baggage Cart means passenger baggage trolleys.|$|R
50|$|Rollers - <b>Dollies</b> have {{built-in}} rollers or balls bearings on {{the deck}} {{to assist in the}} moving of containers or pallets. Advance <b>dollies</b> have two sets of power driven rollers, one set moves the container forward and backward, and the other move it left and right. The precise movement is needed to align the center of gravity of the container {{to the center of the}} deck, or else the <b>dollies</b> may turn over when in motion. In addition, the containers or pallets on <b>dollies</b> are secured with built-in locks.|$|R

5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, <b>Dolly</b> Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June–August. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden floorboards during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and <b>Dolly</b> Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00UTC on August19, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Chetumal to Progreso, Yucatán, while {{a tropical}} storm watch was placed between Pinar del Río Province and Isle of Pines, Cuba. Just three hours later, another tropical storm warning was put into effect between San Pedro Town, Belize, and the Mexican border. On August20, the tropical storm watch was discontinued for Cuba, as the system was {{moving away from the}} area. At 15:00UTC, another tropical storm warning was issued from Progreso, Yucatán, to Ciudad del Carmen. Only an hour later, {{a tropical storm}} warning from Cozumel to Chetumal was upgraded to a hurricane warning. By 21:00UTC on August20, all warnings south of Cozumel were discontinued. Just six hours later on August 21, all tropical storm warnings east of 88°W were discontinued. Shortly after that, a tropical storm warning east of Progreso was removed. All warnings for Mexico were discontinued at 15:00UTC on August21. When <b>Dolly</b> entered the Bay of Campeche on August22, a hurricane watch was put into action for Veracruz, La Pesca, and all areas in between, at 09:00UTC. Only six hours later, the watch became a hurricane warning until <b>Dolly</b> made landfall at 18:00UTC on August23, when all remaining warnings were removed.|$|E
