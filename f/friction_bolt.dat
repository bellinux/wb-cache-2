Laboratory pull-out tests showed that friction bolts installed in a concrete block with resin were loaded to about 1. 8 tons/ft of bolt length; bolts installed without resin were loaded to 1. 3 tons/ft. Three strain-gauged friction bolts were installed at Hecla Mining Company 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Gold Hunter Mine, Mullan, ID, in the wall or rib of a mechanized cut-and-fill stope. The object of these tests was to establish an installation procedure for the bolt-and-MIDAS combination and to evaluate performance. The stope was advanced in three 15 -ft increments and strains induced in the rock bolts by stress changes in the rock were recorded every 30 minutes. The MIDAS proved to be rugged enough to withstand the shock and vibration from nearby (5 ft) face blasting. Data from MIDAS showed that the <b>friction</b> <b>bolt</b> installed with resin was the most sensitive to each face advance. It showed a steady increase in loading to a maximum value of 1000 microstrain.

The test case consists in two parts of sectors of aircraft engine stators linked together by an Inconel bolt and submitted to tensile loading. The efficiency of these microstructures is evaluated by using finite element (FE) models. The chosen FE models take into account elasto-visco-plastic material behaviors, contact with <b>friction</b> (<b>bolt</b> heads/flanges and flange/flange), and the initial bolt tightening. The parameters of the elasto-visco-plastic (EVP) material law are adjusted from experimental results extracted from tensile tests performed on Inconel, and Ti 5553 alloys.

40|$|AbstractFollowing a {{small-scale}} wedge {{failure at}} Yukon Zinc's Wolverine Mine in Yukon, Canada, a vibration monitoring program {{was added to}} the existing rockbolt pull testing regime.

Analysis of blasting vibration revealed that support integrity is not compromised unless there is a geological structure to act as a failure plane. The peak particle velocity (PPV) rarely exceeded 250  mm/s with a frequency larger than 50  Hz. As expected, blasting more competent rock resulted in higher PPVs.

The paper {{deals with the}} simplification of pre-tensioned bolt model and simplification of load transfer within connection. Influence on normal strain (and thus stress) distribution at critical cross-section is investigated. Laboratory testing of single-angle or double-angle members – to – gusset plates bolted connections were taken as basis for numerical analysis. FE models were created using 1 D and 2 D elements. Angles and gusset plates were modelled with shell elements. Two methods of modelling of <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolting</b> were considered: bolt-regarding approach with 1 D element systems modelling bolts and two variants of bolt-disregarding approach with special constraints over some part of member and gusset plate surfaces in contact: a) constraints over whole area of contact, b) constraints over the area around each bolt shank (“partially tied”). Modelling of <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolted</b> connections using simplified bolt modelling may be effective, {{especially in the case}} of analysis concerning elastic range only. In such a case disregarding bolts and replacing them with “partially tied” modelling seems to be more attractive.

This study contributes to better understanding of roll of slanted end-plate connections under non-symmetric gravity loads {{on the value of}} the induced initial axial force due to elevated temperature in steel beams, and a comparison of the effect of symmetric gravity loads on the behaviour of such connections, before and after elevated temperature. The results imply that, before any thermal effects, a non-symmetric gravity load can be more critical than a symmetric load; the average ratio of axial force of a non-symmetric load to a symmetric load was found to be 1. 49 – 1. 57. This value was determined to be 1. 64 – 1. 90 when <b>friction</b> <b>bolts</b> instead of normal bolts were used. On the other hand, when a steel beam is subjected to a temperature increase, the amount of reaction and initial axial forces in the steel beam are not related to the type of loading.

40|$|Abstract: A 3 D {{finite element}} model of bolt {{composite}} joint has been established to determine the stress distribution on the contact surface. The effects of clamping torque and friction on the contact stress and interlaminar normal stress are considered. From the analysis results, contact stress is bared mainly by the 0 ° layer. The distribution and magnitude of contact stress are conducted by friction. The effect of clamping torque on interlaminar normal stress is very strong.

40|$|Rock anchors {{are used}} {{extensively}} in coal mines in the United States {{and around the}} world. The conditions {{in many of these}} coal mines are conducive towards the corrosion of rock anchors. Despite this, very little research has been performed to analyze corrosion and its effects on rock anchors in US coal mines. The specific aim of this thesis is to analyze typical Illinois Coal Basin (ICB) mine parameters and their effects on corrosion. A well understood relationship between these parameters and corrosion would be useful in locating highly corrosive areas and mitigating risks associated with corrosion. To study ICB mine parameters and their effects on corrosion, three general experiment types were carried out: in situ rock anchor analysis, simulated mine environment testing and analysis, and electrochemical testing and analysis. 	For in situ rock anchor analysis, open circuit potential (OCP) of rock anchors in coal mines with various conditions were measured. The OCP values can be used to predict whether or not corrosion of the rock anchors has initiated, and to study relationships between mine parameters and corrosion. The readings were also used to assess the validity of experimental setups by comparing experimental OCP values to in situ mine OCP values. The OCP readings obtained were found to vary by locations within the mines indicating corrosion conditions can vary relative to location. No clear trends were found between the OCP values and moisture or rock anchor age likely indicating numerous other factors were affecting the OCP values. These other significant factors will need to be determined and measured in addition to moisture and age in order to develop clear relationships between mine parameters and OCP values. Overall, the experimental OCP values found were slightly more negative than the in situ OCP values. This may have been {{due to the fact that}} the corrosion tanks exposed the rock anchors to more moisture. It is also a possible indication that mine rock anchors were not yet significantly corroding. 	For simulated environments, three tanks were filled with solution made by adding chloride ions, sulfate ions, and iron ions. The concentrations were based on water samples from mines and were the same for each tank. The temperatures of each tank were set at 30 °C or 50 °C, and the pH levels were set at 5. 5 or 9. The tanks were then loaded with thirteen different types of rock anchors. The solution compositions were monitored over time, and the rock anchors were removed at specified intervals and tested to tensile destruction. The decreasing ultimate strengths of anchors were assumed to be related to the corrosion rate. This relationship was used to study the corrosion rates of multiple rock anchor types in varying conditions. Results seemed to indicate higher temperatures caused the highest corrosion rates. Basic pH levels caused a less significant increase in corrosion. With respect to reduced visible surface corrosion, epoxy coatings were the most effective followed by the proprietary coating, and then the galvanized coating. All bolts, cable anchors, and <b>friction</b> <b>bolts</b> with no coating had significant visible corrosion relative to rock anchors with protective coatings. Cable bolts with no coating and <b>friction</b> <b>bolts</b> seemed to have had the largest decrease in strength, and this is hypothesized to be a result of having larger exposed surface areas than other rock anchor types. 	For electrochemical testing and analysis, potentiodynamic polarization tests were used to estimate the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current (Icorr) of rock anchor metals in simulated mine environments. Ecorr can be used as an indication of the conditions necessary for the initiation of corrosion, and Icorr can be used to determine the rate of corrosion. The effects of pyritic sulfur from coal samples in solution, pH of solution, temperature, and the bolt grade on Ecorr and Icorr values were analyzed. No significant trends were observed between electrochemical properties and pyritic sulfur concentrations. pH, temperature, and bolt grade were also parameters that were analyzed, and of these, only temperature had a significant effect on electrochemical properties. The penetration rate increased significantly with respect to increasing temperatures. All corrosion rates in the simulated mine water were considered low according to the standard specifying corrosion rates and characteristics that was used. 	This research has shown mine corrosion parameters are consistent in localized areas. The results, however show additional parameters other than age and moisture must be accounted for in order to accurately predict the risk of corrosion in a given mine. Simulated mine testing results showed that corrosion prevention coatings are effective in reducing corrosion in the conditions tested. Electrochemical test showed corrosion rates were all low in the mine solutions tested. Temperature had the most significant effect on corrosion rates in both the simulated mine tests and electrochemical tests. The electrochemical tests also showed that increased temperature can only simulate increased corrosion periods up to the point that other reaction factors limit the reaction rate independent of temperature. To fully understand corrosion risks in ICB mines, additional parameters and experimental methods should be considered in order to increase the understanding of relationship between ICB mine parameters and corrosion...|$|R

The flange, welded with the bottom beam flange as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolts</b> are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates.

40|$|AbstractAs {{attention}} is being focused increasingly towards minimising carbon emissions and enhancing the possibly of material recycling {{in the construction}} industry, traditional composite systems are recognised as being problematic on several counts. Composite action between the conventional concrete slab and steel beam is provided typically by stud shear connectors welded to the top flange of the steel beam, and the demolition of such members requires {{a considerable amount of}} time and energy, as well as being environmentally intrusive and creating much waste. In addition, existing composite systems mostly utilise conventional concrete made from ordinary Portland cement whose production is attributed to a large portion of carbon emissions worldwide. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast concrete slabs be attached to a steel frame with semi-rigid bolted connections using high-strength <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolts</b> as the elements to provide the shear connection. Moreover, the use of geopolymer concrete in the casting of the slabs eliminates the use of ordinary Portland cement entirely.

There is an adjustable rear-sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has helical grooves cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling {{from the inside of}} the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of direct impingement {{is that the}} breech of the firearm's firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly due to being exposed to the propellants of the cartridge.

40|$|In machine {{assembly}} it {{is often}} required that bolts used to fasten machine parts be installed with specific design preloads.

Studies by Blake and Kurtz [1] and Heyman [2] have shown that when bolts are torqued into place, the fraction of applied torque which translates into useful preload is small and widely variable.

40|$|Abstract Rock {{is under}} greater {{abutment}} {{stress and strain}} on the sidewall periphery of an excavation than deeper in the rock especially {{in the immediate aftermath}} of mining.

40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} {{of all the}} fretting fatigue test results available in the literature is carried out by employing refined asymptotic solutions. Several different criteria are used and it is shown that two give an improvement over stress-based criteria. These procedures provide a practical method for both designing against fretting fatigue failure and quantifying the nucleation time when fretting is unavoidable. The reduced stiffness method is developed together with the evolutionary algorithm which is the direct implementation of the Signorini and Coulomb friction contact inequalities. This method is capable of solving two dimensional frictional contact problems in significantly less time and is more accurately than a traditional FE approach. In addition, algorithms for determining shakedown limit of coupled contacts have also been developed. A problem of a plane receding contact was considered where a strip is pressed against an elastically similar half-plane by normal pressure extending along the strip surface but stopping short of the end. These phenomena are analysed, together with the behaviour of the system when the pressure is removed. Interfacial characteristics of a lap joint formed using <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolts</b> is also considered as these produce a receding contact. The joints consist of two elastically similar laps pressed in contact by a constant normal force and subject to oscillatory bulk load at the free end of the laps. Bulk load applied at the free ends causes a smooth change {{in the size of}} contact and the development of the slip zones. The trend of energy dissipation with the extent of contact and magnitude of remote tension, at various friction coefficients, has been found. Lastly, axisymmetric receding contact between a circular elastic disc pressed against a half-space has been studied. The disc is first subjected to normal pressure followed by torsion. Normal pressure alone causes a contact interface to separate, if the loaded area is sufficiently small. Torsion is subsequently applied which causes a change in the size of contact and has a significant effect on the direction of the resultant slip displacement and the stick/slip boundaries. </p...|$|R

40|$|There {{exists a}} need for a {{relatively}} inexpensive system for measuring strain in bolts. The torque wrench is one technique for straining bolts which has been widely applied. Unfortunately, <b>friction</b> in the <b>bolt</b> threads and between the nut and the work tend to make such a simple system inaccurate. In practice, a torque wrench is unacceptable for many situations where strain is critical. In this article, an ultrasonic technique is described which can indicate changes in bolt strain to better than one part in 10, 000. The technique is based on the one-dimensional propagating-ultrasonic-wave model and uses a new ultrasonic instrument called a Reflection Oscillator Ultrasonic Spectrometer which is a closed-loop feedback marginal-oscillator system that frequency locks the device to the peak of a mechanical resonance in the bolt. The instrument indicates a shift in the bolt resonance frequency due to elongation and changes in velocity of sound due to strain. Data are presented comparing a standard torque wrench to the ultrasonic monitor for different measured stresses on the bolt as well as for different bolt conditions. The strain instrument can be used to monitor changing stresses, to measure material properties and may be applied as a strain gage or load cell...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of aU the fretting fatigue test results {{available in the}} literature is carried out by employing refined asymptotic solutions. Several different criteria are used and it is shown that two give an improvement over stress-based criteria. These procedures provide a practical method for both designing against fretting fatigue failure and quantifying the nucleation time when fretting is unavoidable. The reduced stiffness method is developed together with the evolutionary algorithm which is the direct implementation of the Signorini and Coulomb friction contact inequalities. This method is capable of solving two dimensional frictional contact problems in significantly less time and is more accurately than a traditional FE approach. In addition, algorithms for determining shakedown limit of coupled contacts have also been developed. A problem of a plane receding contact was considered where a strip is pressed against an elastically similar half-plane by normal pressure extending along the strip surface but stopping short of the end. These phenomena are analysed, together with the behaviour of the system when the pressure is removed. Interfacial characteristics of a lap joint formed using <b>friction</b> grip <b>bolts</b> is also considered as these produce a receding contact. The joints consist of two elastically similar laps pressed in contact by a constant normal force and subject to oscillatory bulk load at the free end of the laps. Bulk load applied at the free ends causes a smooth change {{in the size of}} contact and the development of the slip zones. The trend of energy dissipation with the extent of contact and magnitude of remote tension, at various friction coefficients, has been found. Lastly, axisymmetric receding contact between a circular elastic disc pressed against a half-space has been studied. The disc is first subjected to normal pressure followed by torsion. Normal pressure alone causes a contact interface to separate, if the loaded area is sufficiently small. Torsion is subsequently appl ied which causes a change in the size of contact and has a significant effect on the direction of the resultant slip displacement and the stick/slip boundaries.

40|$|In recent Canterbury earthquakes, {{structures}} {{have performed}} well {{in terms of}} life safety but the estimated {{total cost of the}} rebuild was as high as $ 40 billion. The major contributors to this cost are repair/demolition/rebuild cost, the resulting downtime and business interruption. For this reason, the authors are exploring alternate building systems that can minimize the downtime and business interruption due to building damage in an earthquake; thereby greatly reducing the financial implications of seismic events. In this paper, a sustainable and demountable precast reinforced concrete (RC) frame system in which the precast members are connected via steel tubes/plates or steel angles/plates and high strength <b>friction</b> grip (HSFG) <b>bolts</b> is introduced. In the proposed system, damaged structural elements in seismic frames can be easily replaced with new ones; thereby making it an easily and quickly repairable and a low-loss system. The column to foundation connection in the proposed system can be designed either as fixed or pinned depending on the requirement of strength and stiffness. In a fixed base frame system, ground storey columns will also be damaged along with beams in seismic events, which are to be replaced after seismic events; whereas in a pin base frame only beams (which are easy to replace) will be damaged. Low to medium rise (3 - 6 storey) precast RC frame buildings with fixed and pin bases are analyzed in this paper; and their lateral capacity, lateral stiffness and natural period are scrutinized to better understand {{the pros and cons of}} the demountable precast frame system with fixed and pin base connections...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 16) Experimental {{research on}} the effects of dynamic loading and oversized holes on both the slip strength and ultimate failure strength of <b>bolted,</b> <b>friction</b> type connections using A 325 bolts is reported. A "Friction Type Connection" is a structural steel connection which resists loads by friction between the connected parts. This condition is obtained when high-strength bolts are tightened to develop sufficient clamping force between the connected parts. It is frequently desirable to increase the diameter of the hole relative to the diameter of the bolt to reduce the problem of hole misalignment between connected parts when erecting steel structures. Tests were performed on two bolt connections using three-quarter inch diameter bolts. The tests indicated that dynamic loading had only a slightly detrimental effect on the slip strength of bolts, but caused a ten to twenty-five percent reduction in the ultimate strength of the connections. It was found that increased hole size also reduced slip and ultimate strength and that the combined effects of dynamic loading and oversized holes was greater than the sum of the two individual effects when isolated. Dynamic loading of connections with oversized holes gave slip strengths of 82 percent and ultimate strengths of 81 percent of the strengths of static testing of connections with normal sized holes. Other bolt sizes up to one and one-eighth inch diameter bolts were also tested with oversized holes under dynamic conditions but the three-quarter inch diameter bolt size was found to be the worst case. It was felt that bolted connections with oversized holes are acceptable for structural steel construction when subjected to dynamic loading...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a series of static tests on resin {{injected}} bolted joints with pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material. The aim is to characterise a method of connection that could be fatigue and slip resistant. For comparison, tests are also carried out on standard bolted connections without resin and with 2 mm clearance holes. Slip in joints is a major issue in bridge engineering, which has to be controlled if the structural scheme is to perform satisfactorily over its service life. The transfer of connection force in FRP joints, by way of frictional force, say by using High Strength <b>Friction</b> Grip (HSFG) <b>bolts,</b> cannot be relied upon [1], because steel bolting is known to lose its pre-tension with time due to the viscoelastic properties of the FRP. The aim of our preliminary study is to offer a potential solution to developing a suitable slip resistant connection. Tests are conducted on double lap-shear joints according to Annex G of BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008 [2]. The hexagon injection bolts and bottom washer are prepared as per Annex K of the same standard. A new top washer has been designed and tested to ensure smooth resin filling in the cavity between bolt (M 16) and 2 mm hole clearance. It is expected that resin injected bolting will provide a mechanical fastening system that has locking capabilities. If successful the outcome of our research will address the challenge of durability and will ensure longer service lives for joint limit states under bridge loading. The results will also help in preparation of recognised design guidelines for FRP bridges...|$|R
