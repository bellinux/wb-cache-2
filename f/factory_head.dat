5000|$|A hammer is {{also used}} to [...] "ring" [...] an {{installed}} rivet, as a non-destructive test for tightness and imperfections.

50|$|Rivets {{small enough}} and soft enough are often bucked. In this process the {{installer}} places a rivet gun against the <b>factory</b> <b>head</b> and holds a bucking bar against the tail or a hard working surface. The bucking bar is a specially shaped solid block of metal. The rivet gun provides {{a series of}} high-impulse forces that upsets and work hardens {{the tail of the}} rivet between the work and the inertia of the bucking bar. Rivets that are large or hard may be more easily installed by squeezing instead. In this process a tool in contact with each end of the rivet clinches to deform the rivet.|$|E

5000|$|A rivet is a {{permanent}} mechanical fastener. Before being installed, a rivet consists of a smooth cylindrical shaft with a head on one end. The end opposite to the head is called the tail. On installation the rivet is placed in a punched or drilled hole, and the tail is upset, or bucked (i.e., deformed), so that it expands to about 1.5 times the original shaft diameter, holding the rivet in place. In other words, pounding creates a new [...] "head" [...] {{on the other end}} by smashing the [...] "tail" [...] material flatter, resulting in a rivet that is roughly a dumbbell shape. To distinguish between the two ends of the rivet, the original head is called the <b>factory</b> <b>head</b> and the deformed end is called the shop head or buck-tail.|$|E

50|$|A {{social problem}} {{grew out of}} the {{short-lived}} running of a stoneware factory that existed from 1778 to 1788 {{in the middle of the}} Upper Village. There, the Bishopric of Worms was having “Dirmstein Faïence” made from the white clay that came from the Bishopric’s own stripmine near today’s Hettenleidelheim in the northeast Palatinate Forest, a product whose now few preserved examples are sought-after in collectors’ circles. As early as 1779, a few months after production began, the then mayor, Johann Michael Graeff, schemed against the <b>factory</b> <b>head</b> and ceramics expert Johann Carl Vogelmann, casting false accusations his way, whereupon Vogelmann’s belongings were withheld as he, along with his wife and seven children, was hounded out of the village. Graeff took the banished former head’s job at the factory, but was such a dilettante when it came to running the business that in 1782, the Bishopric unseated him. Under Graeff’s successors, though, the business never did recover, leading to the 20- to 30-strong workforce’s impoverishment, culminating in strike-like events. Further reasons given for ending the project were the cumbersome carting of the raw materials over some 25 km and the distribution difficulties with the finished products in the face of the many customs duties.|$|E
