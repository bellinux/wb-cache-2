5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E

Later that day, the couple attempted a double suicide by taking large doses of laudanum, but both survived.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E
5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help.</b> Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige {{expanded}} and embellished York Minster and other churches in his archdiocese, {{and built the}} tower at Beverley, as well as giving books and other items to the church there. He consecrated Herewald as Bishop of Llandaff at a council held at London in 1056, although this information is only attested in the Book of Llandaff, a sometimes unreliable source. In 1059 he, along with Earl Tostig and Æthelwine Bishop of Durham, escorted King Malcolm III of Scotland to King Edward's court at Gloucester when Malcolm came south, probably to thank Edward <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> in restoring Malcolm to the Scottish throne, and perhaps to acknowledge the English king as Malcolm's lord.|$|E

Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated.

5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> writing a paper to {{be presented to the}} commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet 12th Army based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|These {{victories}} {{proved to}} be very costly to Pyrrhus and he diverted his attention to Sicily, where the Greek states on the island were appealing <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> against Carthage. Despite defeating the Carthaginians and occupying most of the island, Pyrrhus' behaviour alienated him from his Greek allies and {{he was forced to}} abandon Sicily and return to the Italian mainland. Pyrrhus attacked the rebuilt Roman army and after the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum, Pyrrhus returned to Epirus after leaving a garrison at Tarentum.|$|E

5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help,</b> M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E
5|$|Himeji Castle {{dates to}} 1333, when Akamatsu Norimura built a fort {{on top of}} Himeyama hill. The fort was {{dismantled}} and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346, and then remodeled into Himeji Castle two centuries later. Himeji Castle was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who added a three-story castle keep. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large castle complex. Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For over 400 years, Himeji Castle has remained intact, even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.|$|E

When Ed learns what has happened, he accuses Natasha and Andrew of using him. Natasha tries to apologise, but Ed insists that she and Andrew pay him <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> and then they can go their separate ways. Ed and Natasha eventually make up and she asks him out on a date. Andrew reveals that an offer as been made for the app, but Natasha refuses to sell it.

Andrew tries to stop Natasha from calling the police and he bumps Chris' arm, causing him to lose control of the car and crash.

Cubs {{prospects}} Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez credited Ramirez <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after {{the loss of his}} uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain as to what Ramirez would do next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{was brought}} to Constantinople in 1621 by Cyril Lucar (first a patriarch of Alexandria, then later a patriarch of Constantinople). Lucar was {{involved}} in a complex struggle with the Turkish government, the Catholic Church, and his own subordinates. He was supported by English government and presented the codex to James I in 1624, as a gratitude <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help.</b> The codex was presented through the hands of Thomas Roe (together with minuscule 49), the English ambassador at the court of the Sultan. King James died before the manuscript started for England, and the offer was transferred to Charles I in 1627. It became a part of the Royal Library, British Museum and since 1973 of the British Library. It was saved from the fire at Ashburnam House (the Cotton library) on 23 October 1731, by the librarian, Richard Bentley.|$|E
5|$|The young Ali ibn Abdallah {{began his}} career under his brother. In 936, Hasan invited his younger brother to his service, {{promising}} him the governorship of Diyar Bakr (the region around Amida) in exchange <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>help</b> against Ali ibn Ja'far, the rebellious governor of Mayyafariqin. Ali ibn Abdallah was successful in preventing Ibn Ja'far from receiving the assistance of his Armenian allies, and also secured control over the northern parts of the neighbouring province of Diyar Mudar after subduing the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj. From this position, he also launched expeditions to aid the Muslim emirates of the Byzantine frontier zone (the Thughur) against the advancing Byzantines, and intervened in Armenia to reverse growing Byzantine influence (see below).|$|E
