5|$|The {{courtship}} between Ferdinand and Miranda {{is one of}} {{the chief}} beauties of this play. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> purity of love. The pretended interference of Prospero with it heightens its interest, and is in character with the magician, whose sense of preternatural power makes him arbitrary, tetchy, and impatient of opposition.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, {{imperfect}} {{information in}} a leadership game reduces to Cournot competition. However, some Cournot strategy profiles are sustained as Nash equilibria but can be eliminated as incredible threats (as described above) by applying the solution concept of subgame perfection. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> thing that makes a Cournot strategy profile a Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game that prevents it from being subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|The episode follows policewoman Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) as {{she comes}} to Los Angeles to further {{investigate}} the mysterious past of her stepfather by researching information about his previous life as science fiction writer Thaddeus Mobley (Thomas Randall Mann). Meanwhile, the viewers also witness Mobley's story back in the 1970s, while following via animation the story of The Planet Wyh, one of his novels. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first Fargo episode to feature only one main character (although Coon's fellow main cast member Ewan McGregor also voices a character in The Planet Wyh), {{and the first to}} take place outside of Minnesota, North Dakota, or South Dakota.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} Tharoor's removal {{from the post}} of {{congress}} spokesperson, The Telegraph (Calcutta) opined, “For an Opposition MP to have and to exercise the freedom to appreciate a good thing done {{by the government and}} for a ruling party MP to speak and vote against the party line is not just legitimate parliamentary practice, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> essence of parliamentary democracy. Shashi Tharoor, from the ranks of the Congress has tried to do that; there is not one BJP MP who has matched him. Blind conformism is not loyalty, nor independent thinking, dissent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The art {{historian}} Olivier Berggruen situates in Basquiat's anatomical screen prints, titled Anatomy, an assertion of vulnerability, one which [...] "creates an aesthetic {{of the body}} as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity." ...|$|E

50|$|Although Laguna Creek {{generally}} runs dry in summer, on October 17, 2012, two-year-old {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{were observed in}} cold, spring-fed perennial pools along the Filoli property.

2500|$|His friend William Tiptaft wrote, [...] "We shall preach in churches, chapels, barns, rooms, or in {{the open}} air. We shall, if the Lord {{strengthens}} us for the work, give great offence. But it is a glorious work to preach the everlasting gospel. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> purpose for which I was ordained. Christ will not turn us out of His Church for following His steps in preaching the gospel in every city and village. I {{should not be surprised}} if the Bishop withdraw Bulteel's license as he is only a curate." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Under {{traditional}} {{notions of}} justice, the harms alleged—if true—should entitle [...] to some legal remedy {{on behalf of}} herself and her children against Travelers and Greenspring. Consider just one of her claims—breach of contract. This cause of action—that contractual promises can be enforced in the courts—pre-dates Magna Carta. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> bedrock of our notion of individual autonomy and property rights. It {{was among the first}} precepts of the common law to be recognized in the courts of the Commonwealth and has been zealously guarded by the state judiciary from that day to this. Our entire capitalist structure depends on it.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Attenborough, who {{directed}} Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going {{to great lengths}} during the filming of Shadowlands (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and Debra Winger), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for [...] "this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, Elwood <b>was</b> leased by <b>the</b> Lewis River Transportation Service {{to replace}} Mascot on the Lewis River run.

2500|$|In January 2015 the Victorian Government {{announced}} it was negotiating with East West Connect {{on the cost of}} dissolving the contracts. Speculation rose that the costs of terminating the contracts could pass $1.1 billion, but the Andrews government denied the claim and threatened to pass legislation to overturn compensation provisions in the contract if a compromise could not be reached. Prime Minister Tony Abbott criticised the Andrews government's stance, telling the National Press Club: [...] "Surely, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> midsummer of madness to pay $1.2 billion not to build a road ... I can't think of anything more crazy than spending $1.2 billion not to build a road, given that the Victorian government's contribution, after the federal government's contribution, after road users' contribution, after the private investors’ contribution, was probably only going to be $1.5 billion in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|The play, however, doesn’t simply {{depict the}} fall of one order, it also depicts the rise of another; [...] "How the nation might have {{remained}} true to itself is signified by the words and deeds of Talbot. What she {{is in danger of}} becoming is signified by the shortcomings of the French, failings that crop up increasingly amongst Englishman [...] also manifest are an English decline towards French effeminacy and the beginnings of reliance upon fraud and cunning rather than manly courage and straightforward manly virtue." [...] If the old mode of honourable conduct is specifically represented by Talbot and Henry V, the new mode of duplicity and Machiavellianism is represented by Joan, who employs a type of warfare with which Talbot is simply unable to cope. This is seen most clearly when she sneaks into Rouen and subsequently refuses to face Talbot in a battle. Talbot finds this kind of behaviour incomprehensible and utterly dishonourable. As such, he finds himself fighting an enemy who uses tactics he is incapable of understanding; with the French using what he sees as unconventional methods, he proves unable to adapt. This represents one of the ironies in the play's depiction of chivalry; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> resoluteness of Talbot's honour and integrity, his insistence in preserving an old code abandoned by all others, which ultimately defeats him; his inability to adjust means he becomes unable to function in the newly established 'dishonourable' context. As such, the play is not entirely nostalgic about chivalry; [...] "so often the tenets of chivalry are mocked by word and action. The play is full of moments of punctured aristocratic hauteur." ...|$|E

50|$|However {{hard and}} durable was her perfectionist spirit, and however vital her anger at {{intentional}} cruelty or political mayhem, her corresponding sensitivity for the victims, which might fuel her artistic expression, also might cause {{her to be}} vulnerable as well, even surprisingly fragile.
