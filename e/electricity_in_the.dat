5|$|In {{addition}} to flood damage, hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines over large areas and many homes were damaged to varying degrees.

Along the East Coast hiking trail, an estimated 5,000 trees were downed. In all, losses from the hurricane were placed at $200million, ranking it as the costliest cyclone in Newfoundland history.

By about three days after the storm, all schools were reopened. The Mexican government distributed food, water, and construction materials for the areas most affected in Veracruz.

The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed.

40|$|What factors affect <b>electricity</b> rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> market? This is {{a simple}} {{question}} with a complicated answer. The use of electricity is very universal. Electricity {{is one of the}} sources for of progress for human civilization. Wherever there is a market, there is some competition. However, some industrial fields are resistant to competition. The electricity market is one of them. <b>In</b> <b>electricity</b> markets, deregulation has been undertaken for more than two decades. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how the deregulation of <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> markets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U. S. and Canada affects <b>electricity</b> rates. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> statistical tests, I set four different rates as dependent variables：total rates, residential rates, commercial rates and industrial rates. The estimation results reveals that <b>electricity</b> deregulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U. S. and Canada is a failed experiment and the costs are borne by the residential consumers. Unexpectedly, commercial and industrial consumers are not affected by deregulation based on the test results...|$|R

5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of <b>electricity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with <b>electricity.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A.

About 7,500 customers in Indiana near the Indianapolis region were still without power on February 15, down from a peak of about 50,000 especially in the Bloomington area. Other states that reported outages included Kentucky (14,000), Maryland (at least 135,000 customers, including 69,000 in Anne Arundel County and 25,000 in Prince George's County, Maryland), New Jersey (36,000), Pennsylvania (10,000 in the Pittsburgh region), Virginia (7,800), and New York (18,000) on Long Island. By 10:00 am Thursday, February 15, about 73,000 homes were without <b>electricity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Washington DC metropolitan area.

5|$|Operation Southern Move was to {{be carried}} out in two stages. The first stage {{involved}} the capture of Mrkonjić Grad and the surrounding Podrašnica Valley.

The whole operation was planned to take four days, immediately preceding a country-wide ceasefire scheduled to take effect on the morning of 12 October 1995. According to Brigadier Ante Kotromanović, then commander of the 126th Home Guard Regiment, the offensive was approved by the United States, and U.S. warplanes attacked VRS positions near Banja Luka in preparation of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|The clash at the Plitvice Lakes worsened {{the overall}} {{situation}} in Croatia {{and led to}} an escalation of the conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, {{the situation in the}} area continued to deteriorate following the clash. In nearby Plaški, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko–Lička Jasenica–Ogulin road. By summer, the blockades were extended to the north of Plaški and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and <b>electricity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
