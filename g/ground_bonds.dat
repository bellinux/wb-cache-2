40|$|The terms <b>grounding</b> and <b>bonding</b> {{are often}} used interchangeably also if they are a {{combined}} protective measure, having a distinct function. The terms need to be understood separately in order to correctly apply equipment in the most beneficial manner.

50|$|This test is {{performed}} {{by measuring the}} resistance between the third pin (ground) and outside metal body of the product under test. The maximum acceptable value is generally 0.5 ohms although certain standards may specify 0.1 ohms. This test is generally carried out at a slightly higher current (e.g. 25-60 A) so that the <b>ground</b> <b>bond</b> circuit maintains safe voltages on the chassis of the product, even at a high current, before the circuit breaker trips. This test is essential so that the product does not cause an electric shock resulting from insulation failure. In India current specified is 16 A so the test is done at double of the current i.e. 32 A.|$|R
50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly <b>grounded</b> or <b>bonded.</b> The phenomenon is known technically as stray current corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor <b>grounding</b> or poor <b>bonding</b> occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water filtration device or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's electrical continuity to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper bonding jumper cable connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from stray current corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the <b>grounding</b> and <b>bonding</b> of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|R

The signals for these parameters are for the most part low-level signals that require good instrumentation amplification.

50|$|Bond takes M to Skyfall, {{his family}} estate and {{childhood}} {{home in the}} Scottish Highlands. Laying a trap, he instructs Q and Tanner to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, a decision Mallory discovers and unexpectedly supports. Bond and M are met by Kincade, the Skyfall gamekeeper. The trio set {{up a series of}} booby traps throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M and Kincade manage to kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with a second party and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade off through a secret tunnel to a chapel on the <b>grounds.</b> <b>Bond</b> detonates gas canisters and retreats down the same tunnel as M and Kincade. The blast causes the helicopter to crash, destroying the house and killing all but a handful of Silva's men.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the issue}} of control of impact forces {{generated}} during {{the interaction between the}} hopping ro-bot toe and the ground while landing has been considered. The force thus generated can damage the robot altogether. With the objective to control these impact forces, impedance control strategy has been applied to the hopping robot system. The dynamics pertaining to the impact between robot toe and ground has been modeled as in case of a ball bouncing on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Bond</b> Graph theory has been used for the modeling of the hopping robot system. Simulation results show that impact forces generated during the landing has been controlled to a specified limiting value. This model and the corresponding analysis can be further extended for understanding the dynamics involved in continuous hopping of robot with constant height and velocity control...|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of an equipotential zone will protect a worker standing within it from hazardous step and touch potentials. Such a zone can be produced {{through the use of}} a metal mat connected to the grounded object. Usually this metal mat (or ground mesh) is connected to buried ground rods to increase contact with the earth and effectively reduce grid impedance. In some cases, a grounding grid can be used to equalize the voltage within the grid. Equipotential zones will not, however, protect employees who are either wholly or partially outside the protected area. Bonding conductive objects in the immediate work area can also be used to minimize the potential between the objects and between each object and <b>ground.</b> (<b>Bonding</b> an object outside the work area can increase the touch potential to that object in some cases, however.) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} various two-leg ladder models exhibiting gapped phases. All {{of these}} phases have short-ranged valence <b>bond</b> <b>ground</b> states, {{and they all}} exhibit string order. However, we show that short-ranged valence <b>bond</b> <b>ground</b> states divide into two topologically distinct classes, and as a consequence, there exist two topologically distinct types of string order. Therefore, not all gapped phases {{belong to the same}} universality class. We show that phase transitions occur when we interpolate between models belonging to different topological classes, and we study the nature of these transitions.

40|$|We {{consider}} the simplest example of lattice frustration in the 1 / 4 -filled band, a one-dimensional chain with next-nearest neighbor interactions. For this zigzag ladder with electron-electron {{as well as}} electron-phonon interactions we present numerical results for ground state as well as thermodynamic properties. In this system the <b>ground</b> state <b>bond</b> distortion pattern is independent of electron-electron interaction strength. The spin gap in the ground state of the zigzag ladder increases with the degree of frustration. Unlike in one-dimension, where the spin-gap and charge ordering transitions can be distinct, we show that in the ladder they occur simultaneously. We discuss spin gap and charge ordering transitions in 1 / 4 -filled materials with one, two, or three dimensional crystal structures. We show empirically that regardless of dimensionality the occurrence of simultaneous or distinct charge and magnetic transitions can be correlated with the <b>ground</b> state <b>bond</b> distortion pattern.

5000|$|Another {{less common}} source of ground loop currents, {{particularly}} in high power equipment, is current leaking from the [...] "hot" [...] {{side of the}} power line into the ground system. In addition to resistive leakage, current can also be induced through low impedance capacitive or inductive coupling. The ground potential at different outlets may differ {{by as much as}} 10 to 20 volts due to voltage drops from these currents. Fig. 2 shows leakage current from an appliance such as an electric motor A flowing through the building's ground system G to the neutral wire at the utility <b>ground</b> <b>bonding</b> point at the service panel. The ground loop between components C1 and C2 creates a second parallel path for the current. The current divides, with some passing through component C1, the signal cable S ground conductor, C2 and back through the outlet into the ground system G. The AC voltage drop across the cable's ground conductor from this current introduces hum or interference into component C2.|$|R
40|$|Multiconfigurational quantum {{chemical}} methods (CASSCF/CASPT 2) {{have been}} used to study the chemical bond in the actinide diatoms Ac- 2, Th- 2, Pa- 2, and U- 2. Scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling have been included in the calculations. In the Ac- 2 and Th- 2 diatoms the atomic 6 d, 7 s, and 7 p orbitals are the significant contributors to the bond, while for the two heavier diatoms, the 5 f orbitals become increasingly important. Ac- 2 is characterized by a double bond with a (3) Sigma(-) (g) (0 (g) (+)) <b>ground</b> state, a <b>bond</b> distance of 3. 64. angstrom, and a bond energy of 1. 19 eV. Th- 2 has quadruple bond character with a D- 3 (g) (1 (g)) <b>ground</b> state. The <b>bond</b> distance is 2. 76 angstrom and the bond energy (D- 0) 3. 28 eV.
