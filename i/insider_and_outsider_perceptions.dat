40|$|Community conserved areas (CCAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} forms of protected area in the Pacific islands region. CCAs provide a more socially appropriate approach to conservation than government or exclusive protected areas. Despite this, few CCAs in the Pacific islands have been judged a success. This history of failed initiatives has resulted in increased emphasis on what is required to achieve success at all stages of CCA development (e. g. site selection, establishment and management). Despite the emphasis on success in CCAs and other protected area approaches, the term success has not been examined or defined, but is generally framed within expectations, values and disciplinary boundaries. As a result, what actually constitutes success, from a variety of perspectives, is largely unknown. If we are to understand why CCAs are failing, then it is important to unravel the concept of success itself. This thesis is based on the premise that it is essential to first understand what constitutes success in CCAs from the perspective of the actors associated with these areas, if we are to understand why they are or are not successful. This work was approached through three major phases. The first phase reviewed the research area and provided an overview of the issues and the context for inquiry. Upon commencement of this research there was no up-to-date centralised source of Pacific protected area information. The Pacific Protected Area Database was developed as part of this work. Analysis of the database demonstrated the growth and development of the Pacific islands formal protected area system over the past 100 years. The rise of CCAs as a formally recognised approach to protected area management within the region is identified. The new wave of political support and international promotion of protected areas within the Pacific islands and its impact on CCAs were considered. Given the perception that Pacific CCAs are failing to succeed, the nature of success from the perspective of the different CCA actors were explored in the second phase of this work. This phase, the most in-depth and detailed stage, represents the foundation for theory building. Two separate data-gathering activities with insiders (local actors) and outsiders (external actors) were undertaken. Firstly, outsiders connected with Pacific island CCAs were surveyed through a qualitative questionnaire which explored the issue of success and failure in Pacific CCAs. Time was then spent in five Pacific island CCAs, investigating local-level perspectives of success and failure. Each CCA differed in its management approach, objectives, history and connections with external parties. Community perceptions of success and failure in their CCA, as well as their understanding of conservation, the CCA and motivation to support the village CCA, were explored. The third phase of the research synthesised the results and investigated the potential to reconcile various perceptions of success. Outsiders were again surveyed through a qualitative questionnaire. This last data-gathering activity explored the validity of the results gathered from fieldwork with insiders and the broad applicability of those results in the other CCAs in the Pacific islands. Outsiders were surveyed to explore the perceptual congruency between <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> <b>perceptions</b> of success, conservation and CCA motivation. Outsider views were cooriented against insider views. Results indicate that success is multidimensional and a diversity of perceptions of success exist between and within local CCA communities and between and within outsiders involved with Pacific CCAs. Both insider and outsider groups identified common success themes related to: community, benefits, environmental elements, management, and, external involvement. However, the content, meaning and emphasis of each of these themes differed greatly between and within each group of actors. Specifically, the dissertation provides evidence of differences in how community members and outsiders view CCAs and their success. It was found that success perceptions are influenced by the individuals frame of reference, especially how they conceive conservation and the CCA. To demonstrate how success is conceived a Conservation-Success model was developed. The model demonstrates how the frame of reference used for judging success will reflect individual actor contextual factors, how conservation was communicated and understood, as well as individual expectations of the CCA. The outcomes of this research challenge current approaches to CCA implementation and evaluation, in which internal and external views are regarded as congruent when, in fact, they are incongruent in many aspects. Insiders and outsiders have at times, vastly different understandings of conservation and the CCA, and therefore different systems for assessing CCA success. The results highlight some of the problems and gaps with current approaches and understandings of CCAs in the Pacific, with regional and global relevance and applicability...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores several {{dynamics in}} <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism in the anti-war movement: insider-outsider cooperation and conflict in protest coalitions; transnational protest events' success in uniting <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> outsiders; <b>and</b> coupling of <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> tactics such as protesting and voting. Insider-outsider cooperation in protest coalitions helps to facilitate successful protest events involving rainbow coalitions of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Such events catalyze future insider-outsider cooperation, illustrate which parties are movement allies, educate parties about protesters' concerns, educate protesters about coupling <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> tactics, <b>and</b> may help remobilize activists as voters in subsequent elections. Key rival arguments that are investigated are whether grievances opposing U. S. unilateralism in Iraq, on {{which there was}} a strong issue consensus, are as important as Tarrow's politically opportune domestic targets, such as a government joining the "Coalition of the Willing," in accounting for dynamics in <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism. Cross-national surveys of protesters are paired with content analysis of news coverage of transnational anti-war protest events and with elite interviews of activists. While domestic targets appear to exert some centripetal forces facilitating cooperation between <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders,</b> issue consensus or issue discord on grievances can create either centripetal forces that unite or centrifugal forces that unleash conflict. Grievances have the power to unite or to divide us, and whether they do depends on the issue consensus in the movement and the public about them. Grievances with issue consensus unite us, exerting centripetal forces on <b>insider</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsider</b> activism, whereas grievances with issue discord divide us, wielding centrifugal forces on <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders.</b> Opposing U. S. unilateralism in Iraq without the United Nations, on which there is issue consensus, brings together <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> in protest coalitions, at protest events, and in protesters' tactical choices, and thus has the potential to remobilize protesters as voters. Conversely, linking opposition to war in Iraq with other grievances on which there is discord, such as opposition to war in all cases, opposition to globalization, and support of Palestine, divides <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> in protest coalitions and at protest events and may lead protesters to expand their globalized protest involvement...|$|R

40|$|Draft, {{comments}} welcome A growing literature {{argues that}} politics in mature welfare states {{is characterized by}} new distributive conflicts. New risk groups are expected to advocate specific policies, which respond to their particular needs. The dualization-literature conceptualizes these risk groups in terms of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders,</b> depending on their labor market vulnerability. In this paper, we test whether <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> differ in their policy preferences. Redistribution and social investment typically target the needs of outsiders, while social insurance and performance-related incomes are more advantageous for insiders. Hence, we test whether we find insider-outsider divides with regard to preferences for these policies. In addition, we also test interaction effects with education, since high- <b>and</b> low-skilled <b>outsiders</b> have distinctive risk profiles and needs. The analysis is based on micro-level data from the ESS 2008. The results consistently confirm the expected insider-outsider divide with regard to all analyzed policy preferences (redistribution, social investment, social insurance and the respondent’s support for performance-related incomes). Further, the analysis of interaction effects with education shows that insider-outsider divides on social investment and social insurance prevail only among the medium- and high-skilled respondents, whereas attitudes on the redistribution of income differ between <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> throughout the whole workforce. The paper provides evidence that the increasing dualization of labor markets is reflected in individual preferences and attitudes. This is an important result for studies that analyze the political mobilization of <b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders</b> <b>and</b> – more generally – the implications of dualization for post-industrial welfare politics. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (<b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders),</b> <b>and</b> market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, and distinctively, we {{examine the effect of}} shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. Consistent with past evidence, we find that total ownership by all corporate officers (<b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders)</b> has a positive effect on market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers (<b>insiders</b> <b>and</b> <b>outsiders)</b> <b>and</b> market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by chief executive officers and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by chief financial officers has any significant effect on market valuation, except when interacted with ownership by CEOs. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive (outside) directors has a positive effect on market valuation. The central tenor of our evidence remains largely unchanged across a number of econometric models that sufficiently address different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory.

To enable outsiders to reason from the moral perspective of intelligence, I also pose moral principles for intelligence. My oral history of an intelligence officer involved in nuclear weapons testing fleshes out these principles. But the moral outcomes of weapons research are more closely tied to the epistemic principles than to moral principles of science or intelligence.
