Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome {{and picked up the}} skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The war also posed {{problems}} for the army commanders, given that, prior to 1914, the largest formation any serving General in the BEF had commanded on operations was a division. The expansion of the British Army saw some officers promoted from brigade to corps commander {{in less than a}} year. Army commanders also had to cope with the new tactics and weapons that were developed. With the move from manoeuvre to trench warfare, both the infantry and the artillery <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to work together. During an offensive, and when in defence, they learned how to combine forces to defend the front line. Later in the war, when the Machine Gun Corps and the Tank Corps were added to the order of battle, they were also included in the new tactical doctrine.|$|E

Quintel has most recently worked for Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California developing episodes for Regular Show and provided his real voice to the 23-year-old blue jay Regular Show character Mordecai. In commenting on his voice acting, Quintel noted how he has an easy-going nature and never yells in real life, so he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to yell as the Mordecai character.|$|E
25|$|Heston and Boyd both <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> {{to drive}} a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome {{and picked up the}} skill quickly. (He also learned sword fighting, how to throw a javelin, camel riding, and rowing.) Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers. Among them were Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the third}} {{generation}} of video game consoles, tutorials that explain {{the mechanics of the}} game were rare, and instead, players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> a video game worked by being guided by level design. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed {{in such a way that}} players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles, the first level of Super Mario Bros. lays down the variety of in-game hazards by means of repetition, iteration, and escalation.|$|E

25|$|Until Dieppe, LCAs {{had only}} been used in small numbers. The part of the naval plan, 'Outline for Operation' (JNO 1), for the Dieppe Raid that {{involved}} LCAs, and other minor landing craft, was {{much more complicated than}} any previous combined operations plan. In all other sizable raids beforehand coxswains had groped in the darkness and spent extra time while finding the correct landing beaches. Now a large number of flotillas of various landing craft types needed to coordinate their activities. The endless working-up practices and landing exercises carried out prior to the Dieppe assault were not confined to training infantry; they were also designed to shake down the crews of the landing craft flotillas. This was necessary because officers and ratings with LCA experience were not left idle after operations, but were reassigned to other pressing duties throughout the Navy. This massive raid required more trained crews and more flotilla coordination. The few experienced LCA hands available had to be supplemented by dozens of new crewmen collected by the RNVR. These <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to approach a beach, ground on it, disembark troops, ease off the beach, and remain off shore within instant call, ready to come when necessary.|$|E

He was airlifted to Dorchester Hospital, where his condition was described as serious but stable, before being treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. His injuries included a broken left femur, broken left kneecap, broken and dislocated right elbow, broken and dislocated left hip, multiple fractures of his right wrist, damage to his right hand, a ruptured left bicep, deep cuts to both shins and soft tissue damage. Initially Way hoped that {{he would be able to}} resume his footballing career. On 22 January 2009, Way was discharged from Yeovil Hospital, after having thirteen operations, marking a huge step on his road to recovery, although he was still wheelchair bound. During half-time in Terry Skiverton's first match in charge against Oldham Athletic, on 21 February 2009, Way came on the pitch in his wheelchair and did a lap of honour. Way <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to walk again after his accident, and after his retirement he and stadium technician Bruce James were involved in a lengthy legal battle in the High Court with the insurers of the 4x4 driver over compensation for the accident.|$|E

Varela called it a stressful week, during which the new trio <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to work together, and on a song Panikkar didn't know.

Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as [...] "The Scientific Phenomenalist". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience. His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician, he [...] "couldn't top the Pixies".|$|E

For the same episode, Sarah Strange and Thai-Hoa Lee <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to speak Standard Tibetan phonetically a week in advance of filming. Katharine Isabelle guest starred in [...] "Nubbins" [...] as Sophie. While filming her scenes, Isabelle complained of a dry eye problem, which kept making her almost tear up. However, it ended up being beneficial for her portrayal of her character. Canadian actor Daryl Shuttleworth guest stars as a fight promoter in [...] "Warriors". During a readthrough of the script, Shuttleworth decided his character should speak with a British accent like in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The producers wanted to cast Rekha Sharma in [...] "Instinct" [...] as she appeared in several other Vancouver-based productions, including Battlestar Galactica.

Gil {{says that a}} {{specific}} line in the song, [...] "It's just me with this pain in my chest/Collapsing in tears that I try to hide", is an interpretation of suffering in human life. Julie McCarthy, a critic for National Public Radio, called this [...] "an existential theme" [...] which is often present in his lyrics. Another song featured on the album, [...] "Copo vazio" [...] ("Empty glass"), was written by Gil for famous Brazilian musician Chico Buarque.

Bartik was asked to set up problems for the ENIAC without being taught any techniques. [...] Bartik, who became the co-lead programmer (with Betty Holberton), and the other four original programmers became extremely adept at running the ENIAC; with no manual to rely on, the group reviewed diagrams of the device, interviewed the engineers who had built it, and used this information to teach themselves the skills they needed. Initially, they were not allowed to see the ENIAC's hardware at all since it was still classified and they had not received security clearance; they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to program the machine solely through studying schematic diagrams.
