40|$|Laboratory {{apparatus}} {{is depicted}} {{that is a}} chamber for aerosol deposition of bioparticles on surfaces of test coupons. It is designed for primary use in inoculating both flat and three-dimensional objects with approximately reproducible, uniform dispersions of bacterial spores of the genus Bacillus so that the objects {{could be used as}} standards for removal of the spores by quantitative surface sampling and/or cleaning processes. The apparatus is also designed for deposition of particles other than bacterial spores, including fungal spores, viruses, bacteriophages, and standard micron-sized beads. The novelty of the apparatus lies in the combination of a controllable nebulization system with a settling chamber large enough to contain a significant number of test coupons. Several companies market other nebulizer systems, but none are known to include chambers for deposition of bioparticles to mimic the natural fallout of bioparticles. The nebulization system is an expanded and improved version of commercially available aerosol generators that include nebulizers and drying columns. In comparison with a typical commercial aerosol generator, this system includes additional, higher-resolution flowmeters and an additional pressure regulator. Also, unlike a typical commercial aerosol generator, it includes stopcocks for separately controlling flows of gases to the nebulizer and <b>drying</b> <b>column.</b> To maximize the degree of uniformity of dispersion of bioaerosol, the chamber is shaped as an axisymmetrical cylinder and the aerosol generator is positioned centrally within the chamber and aimed upward like a fountain. In order to minimize electric charge associated with the aerosol particles, the <b>drying</b> <b>column</b> is made of aluminum, the <b>drying</b> <b>column</b> is in direct contact with an aluminum base plate, and three equally spaced Po- 210 antistatic strips are located at the exit end of the <b>drying</b> <b>column.</b> The sides and top of the chamber are made of an acrylic polymer; to prevent accumulation of electric charge on them, they are spray-coated with an anti-static material. During use, the base plate and the sides and top of the chamber are grounded as a further measure to minimize the buildup of electric charge...|$|E
40|$|After harvest, {{rough rice}} is dried, then {{dehulled}} and typically milled before consumption. A broad {{objective of the}} “rice drying process”, which comprises drying and tempering, is to maximize the yield of “whole, intact milled kernels”, quantified by the “head rice yield” (HRY). Since rough rice is commonly dried using cross-flow (CF) dryers in the United States of America, {{the aim of this}} research was to assess the effect of drying and tempering treatments on milling yields when rice was dried in an experimentally-simulated CF <b>drying</b> <b>column.</b> First, because airflow rate was found to be the least-studied “drying variable”, its effect on drying air conditions and rice moisture content profiles was assessed. Additionally, the impact of airflow rate on the material state behavior of rice kernels was considered as a means to explain head rice yield reductions (HRYRs). Second, the effect of tempering approach following CF drying on milling yields was investigated. For the same rice and drying conditions, tempering approach significantly affected HRYs, especially HRYs of samples that were located near the heated-air plenum during CF drying. Third, drying treatments were selected based on the glass transition temperature of rice kernels and applied in the <b>drying</b> <b>column.</b> When kernels did not undergo material state transitions during drying, there was negligible HRYR, regardless if samples had been tempered or not. But, when kernels underwent material state transitions during drying, significant HRYRs occurred, and HRYRs of tempered samples were significantly less than those of non-tempered samples...|$|E

Water was {{withheld}} {{from the other}} column in the PRD treatment, to expose some roots to drying soil. Soil and plant water status were monitored daily and throughout diurnal courses. Over 8 d, there were no treatment differences in leaf water potential (leaf) even though soil moisture content of the upper 6 cm () of the <b>dry</b> <b>column</b> in the PRD treatment decreased by up to 70 %. Stomatal conductance (gs) of PRD plants decreased (relative to WW plants) when of the <b>dry</b> <b>column</b> decreased by 45 %.

The physiological significance of enhanced ethylene evolution of PRD plants was examined using a transgenic tomato (ACO 1 AS) with low stress-induced ethylene production.

This is known as the weak-temperature gradient approach. The simulations of the transition are initialized from coupled-column simulations over non-uniform surface forcing and the transition is forced within the <b>dry</b> <b>column</b> by changing the local and/or remote surface forcings to uniform surface forcing across the columns.

Direct eﬀects of changing surface forcing occur over the ﬁrst few days only. Afterward, it is the evolution of the large-scale circulation which systematically modulates the transition. Its contributions are approximately equally divided between the heating and moistening eﬀects. A transition time is deﬁned to summarize the evolution from suppressed to active convection. It is the time when the rain rate within the <b>dry</b> <b>column</b> is halfway to the mean value obtained at equilibrium over uniform surface forcing.

40|$|Abstract. Partial rootzone drying (PRD) is an {{irrigation}} technique {{where water}} is distributed unevenly {{to the root}} system such that part is irrigated while the remainder is allowed to dry the soil. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants were grown with their roots in two soil columns to compare the physiological consequences of alternation of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>columns</b> during PRD irrigation (alternate PRD, PRD-A) with retention of the same wet and <b>dry</b> <b>columns</b> (fixed PRD, PRD-F). When PRD plants received 50 % less water than well-watered (WW) plants, xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]) increased and stomatal conductance decreased relative toWW plants. Although both sets of PRD plants received {{the same amount of}} water, [X-ABA] of PRD-A plants increased up to 2 -fold above that of PRD-F plants, which further decreased stomatal conductance. Differences in [X-ABA] were detected within an hour of alternation, but did not persist beyond the photoperiod of alternation. [X-ABA] increased linearly as whole-pot soil water content (θpot) and leaf water potential (leaf) declined, but the difference in [X-ABA] between the two sets of PRD plants was not due to differences in either θpot or leaf. In PRD-F plants, the unwatered part of the root system contributes proportionally less to the transpiration stream as the soil progressively dries (Yao et al. 2001, Plant, Cell & Environment 24, 227 – 235).

30|$|How {{does this}} {{acceleration}} occur? If we compare an atmospheric column over a moist humid region with one over a drier region {{we will find}} that the relationship of air pressure (and temperature) with altitude differ.

This moist column now rises and cools and the resulting condensation leads to a drop in atmospheric pressure at the lowest altitudes drawing in yet more moist air which rises, cools and condenses in turn. This process can be sustained {{as long as there is}} sufficient water vapour to fuel the process.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and Methane (CH 4) are the {{two most}} {{important}} anthropogenic greenhouse gases. CH 4 is furthermore one of the most potent present and future contributors to global warming because of its large global warming potential (GWP). Our knowledge of CH 4 and CO 2 source strengths is based primarily on bottom-up scaling of sparse in-situ local point measurements of emissions and up-scaling of emission factor estimates or top-down modeling incorporating data from surface networks and more recently also by incorporating data from low spatial resolution satellite observations for CH 4. There is a need to measure and retrieve the <b>dry</b> <b>columns</b> of CO 2 and CH 4 having high spatial resolution and spatial coverage. In order to fill this gap a new passive airborne 2 -channel grating spectrometer instrument for remote sensing of small scale and mesoscale column-averaged CH 4 and CO 2 observations has been developed. This Methane Airborne MAPper (MAMAP) instrument measures reflected and scattered solar radiation in the short wave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) parts of the electro-magnetic spectrum at moderate spectral resolution. The SWIR channel yields measurements of atmospheric absorption bands of CH 4 and CO 2 in the spectral range between 1. 59 and 1. 69 μm at a spectral resolution of 0. 82 nm. The NIR channel around 0. 76 μm measures the atmospheric O 2 -A-band absorption with a resolution of 0. 46 nm. MAMAP has been designed for flexible operation aboard a variety of airborne platforms. The instrument design and the performance of the SWIR channel, together with some results from on-ground and in-flight engineering tests are presented. The SWIR channel performance has been analyzed using a retrieval algorithm applied to the nadir measured spectra. Dry air column-averaged mole fractions are obtained from SWIR data only by dividing the retrieved CH 4 columns by the simultaneously retrieved CO 2 <b>columns</b> for <b>dry</b> air <b>column</b> CH 4 (X CH 4) and vice versa for <b>dry</b> air <b>column</b> CO 2 (X CO 2). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SWIR channel is approximately 1000 for integration times (t int) in the range of 0. 6 – 0. 8 s for scenes with surface spectral reflectances (SSR) /albedo of around 0. 18. At these integration times the ground scene size is about 23 × 33 m 2 for an aircraft altitude of 1 km and a ground speed of 200 km/h. For these scenes the actual X CH 4 or X CO 2 <b>dry</b> air <b>column</b> retrieval precisions are typically about 1 % (1 σ). Elevated levels of CH 4 have been retrieved above a CH 4 emitting landfill. Similarly the plume of CO 2 from coal-fired power plants can be well detected and tracked. The measurements by the MAMAP sensor could enable estimates of anthropogenic, biogenic and geological emissions of localized intense CH 4 and CO 2 sources such as anthropogenic fugitive CH 4 emissions from oil and gas industry, coal mining, disposal of organic waste, CO 2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, steel production or geologic CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from seepage and volcanoes.

40|$|Two single-column {{models are}} fully coupled via the weak-temperature {{gradient}} approach. The coupled-SCM {{is used to}} simulate the transition from suppressed to active convection {{under the influence of}} an interactive large-scale circulation. The sensitivity of this transition to the value of mixing entrainment within the convective parameterization is explored. The results from these simulations are compared with those from equivalent simulations using coupled cloud-resolving models. Coupled-column simulations over non-uniform surface forcing are used to initialize the simulations of the transition, in which the column with suppressed convection is forced to undergo a transition to active convection by changing the local and/or remote surface forcings. The direct contributions from the changes in surface forcing are to induce a weakening of the large-scale circulation which systematically modulates the transition. In the SCM, the contributions from the large-scale circulation are dominated by the heating effects, while in the CRM the heating and moistening effects are about equally divided. A transition time is defined as the time when the rain rate in the <b>dry</b> <b>column</b> is halfway to the value at equilibrium after the transition. For the control value of entrainment, the order of the transition times is identical to that obtained in the CRM, but the transition times are markedly faster. The locally forced transition is strongly delayed by a higher entrainment. A consequence is that for a 50...|$|R

The {{sampling}} frequency allows for unique vertical cross-sectional analyses of SAL phenomena, including dust events detected by shipboard Sun photometers, observed during March 2004. The observational analyses provide, {{for the first}} time, a coherent, 2 -dimensional space-time depiction of the SAL as an expansive warm, <b>dry,</b> stable <b>column</b> located above the marine boundary layer. Midlevel easterly wind maxima are also observed to occur near {{the leading edge of}} the dry layers. The AEROSE sounding data will be useful for studies of the SAL, as well as for validation of environmental satellite sensors, especially the Aqu...|$|R
50|$|In the {{retrieval}} algorithm measurements {{from the}} three bands are combined to yield column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide. Because these are dry-air mole fractions, these measurements do not change with water content or surface pressure. Because the molecular oxygen content of the atmosphere (i.e. excluding the oxygen in water vapour) is well known to be 20.95%, oxygen {{is used as a}} measure of the total <b>dry</b> air <b>column.</b> To ensure these measurements are traceable to the World Meteorological Organization, OCO-2 measurements are carefully compared with measurements by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).|$|R
40|$|The leading {{pattern of}} extratropical Pacific sea surface {{temperature}} variability [the Pacific decadal oscil-lation (PDO) ] {{is shown to}} depend on observed variability in the spatiotemporal distribution of tropospheric Rossby wave breaking (RWB), where RWB is the irreversible overturning of potential vorticity on isentropic surfaces. Composite analyses based on hundreds of RWB cases show that anticyclonic (cyclonic) RWB {{is associated with a}} warm, moist (cool, <b>dry)</b> <b>column</b> that extends down to a surface anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation, and that the moisture and temperature advection associated with the surface circulation patterns force turbulent heat flux anomalies that project onto the spatial pattern of the PDO. The RWB patterns that are relevant to the PDO are closely tied to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Pacific–North American pattern, and the northern annular mode. These results explain the free troposphere-to-surface segment of the atmospheric bridge concept wherein El Niño anomalies emerge in summer and modify circulation patterns that act over several months to force sea surface temperature anomalies in the extratropical Pacific during late winter or early spring. Leading patterns of RWB account for a significant fraction of PDO interannual variability for any month of the year. A multilinear model is developed in which the January mean PDO index for 1958 – 2006 is regressed upon the leading principal components of cyclonic and anticyclonic RWB from the immediately preceding winter and summer months (four indexes in all), accounting for {{more than two-thirds of the}} variance. 1...|$|R
