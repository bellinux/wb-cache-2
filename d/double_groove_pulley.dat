30|$|For LBPS/CYCo systems, <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers can be {{validated}} by the cross section (Fig.  7 d–f), {{and the interior}} structure tended {{to be similar to}} single CYCo systems (Fig.  7 [*]h). The <b>double</b> <b>grooves</b> produced in the presence of CYCo should be attributed to the formation of glassy skin, subsequent collapse of the jet, and then the elongation into <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers (Fig.  6 c, mechanism III). In these cases, LBPS played an important role to form a glassy skin due to their fast evaporation, while CYCo was another key factor due to its rather slow evaporation rate and high viscosity, which caused the collapse of the polymer jet. For the DMF/CYCo system, even though grooved fibers were obtained when the solvent ratio was equal to or less than 1 : 1, the grooved texture was not well organized, which can be confirmed by the cross section (Fig.  7 [*]g). Obviously, the DER between DMF and CYCo is quite small (DBP, 2.65  °C), so this kind of glassy skin was formed later, leaving insufficient time to be elongated into well-aligned grooved texture before reaching the collector.|$|R

2500|$|A patent {{granted to}} Jonathan Brownill, a cutler from Sheffield, on 1 May 1828, while in {{principle}} operating as an open-air balance lock, {{was described as}} using three caissons.

30|$|More interestingly, NS/(LBPS and HBPS) systems also {{produced}} {{different types of}} grooved texture (Fig.  5). For BuOH/DCM, the electrospinning process was highly unstable and often interrupted by severe needle clogging. However, the 1 : 1 solvent ratio produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers with surface pores and beads, while 1 : 2 resulted in grooved fibers and 1 : 3 led to a wrinkled surface. In this case, the grooved and wrinkled morphologies are both caused by buckling instability under different driving forces. In other words, grooved texture will be formed when the driving force is sufficient, and a lower driving force resulted in wrinkled texture. BuOH/THF {{also produced}} grooved fibers. The 1 : 1 solvent ratio resulted in fibers with small grooves on the surface, and a lower solvent ratio led to more distinct grooved texture. BuOH/DMF contributed to fibers with rough surface. BuOH/CYCo produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers when the ratio is 1 : 1, whereas a lower ratio resulted in beaded fibers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing dynamic {{caustics}} blast loading system, {{the paper}} studied the dynamic behavior of perforated crack propagation {{on the condition}} of different grooving with two borehole blasting and simultaneous initiation.

As {{can be seen from the}} result, stress intensity factor decreased rapidly from the maximum, oscillated, and up to the second peak, then decreased until crack arrested. KI was almost greater than KII. The velocity and acceleration showed a type of fluctuation changes as wave. Acceleration firstly came to the peak, then the velocity came to the peak again, and the process repeated many times. The energy release rate decreased rapidly, oscillated, and then decreased. It remained the same with the variation of the stress intensity factor. Dynamic energy release rate and the dynamic stress intensity factor had the same sense of dynamic fracture mechanics...|$|R
5000|$|Some people {{argue that}} {{elevators}} began as simple rope or chain hoists (see Traction elevators below). An elevator {{is essentially a}} platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a [...] "cage", [...] "carriage" [...] or [...] "car") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a [...] "hoistway". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a [...] "traction" [...] elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply <b>grooved</b> <b>pulley,</b> commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.|$|R

50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on <b>grooved</b> <b>pulleys.</b> This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060, with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm. First {{the influence of the}} charging voltage and the geometrical groove parameters on the deformation behaviour and localised thickness reduction of the tube wall was investigated. The experimental results provided data for optimising the groove design. The Design of Experiments method was used to optimise the shape and dimensions of the internal workpieces with a <b>double</b> <b>groove</b> design. Results of tensile tests on the crimp joints allowed determining the most important parameters for the groove design. Based on these observations an optimal <b>double</b> <b>groove</b> joint design was proposed.

This technique was used to measure the local and global deformation of the joint. Failure mechanisms include pull-out, local shearing and fracture of the tube. Three main failure modes were observed...|$|R
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility to directly electrospin grooved PS fibers by systematically investigating both single and binary solvent systems at given parameters. We found that single solvent systems produced non-grooved fibers. LBPS/DMF solvent systems generated fibers with different grooved textures, while LBPS/CYCo led to fibers with <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> texture. Grooved fibers can also be fabricated from LBPS/LBPS, NS/LBPS, and NS/HBPS systems under specific conditions. The results indicated that grooved fibers can be fabricated from binary solvent systems {{as long as the}} DER is high enough. The formation of grooved texture should be attributed to three mechanisms, namely void-based elongation, wrinkle-based elongation, and collapsed jet-based elongation.|$|R
50|$|Front-loading washers are {{mechanically}} simple {{compared to}} top-loaders, {{with the main}} motor (a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor) normally being connected to the drum via a <b>grooved</b> <b>pulley</b> belt and large pulley wheel, {{without the need for}} a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.|$|R

30|$|For BuOH/(LBPS and HBPS) systems, large pores can {{be found}} in the {{interior}} structure (Fig.  7 i–l). The higher DER of BuOH/DCM (DBP, 77.95  °C) and BuOH/THF (DBP, 51.7  °C) and the formation of interior pores contributed to the formation of grooved texture (Fig.  5 a, b, e, f), which should be ascribed to mechanism II, while BuOH/DMF led to fibers with rough surface because of the insufficient DER (DBP, 35.5  °C). However, BuOH/CYCo (solvent ratio, 1 : 1) produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers, which should be attributed to mechanism III. Although the theoretical DBP is only 37.95  °C, the rather slow evaporation rate of CYCo made the actual DER much larger.|$|R
