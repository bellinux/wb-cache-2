40|$|AbstractEthically sound {{clinical}} research requires that prospective study participants provide voluntary informed consent before any study procedures begin. The original {{intent was to}} provide the participant with clear, accurate information about study specifics (e. g., risks/benefits) {{to aid in the}} decision to participate. Broad consensus among sponsors, research staff, study participants, and advocates indicate that the current process could be improved to enhance participants' understanding of study-related information and meet the needs of individuals. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) convened a project to identify problems in the current process and to formulate recommendations for improvement. A literature review, expert interviews, and multi-stakeholder meeting were conducted to identify barriers and develop solutions for a more <b>effective</b> informed <b>consent</b> process. Four key topics were the foundation of the recommendations: 1) defining an <b>effective</b> informed <b>consent</b> process, 2) training research staff, 3) improving the informed consent document, and 4) exploring the use of electronic consent. The ideal informed consent process involves an ongoing, interactive conversation between the participant and knowledgeable, responsive research staff who were trained in best practices. The informed consent process should be supported by a tiered informed consent document that provides critically relevant information to aid in the decision to participate in a study. Adoption of the CTTI informed consent recommendations should lead to a more participant-centric informed consent process.

This article was the first one in Germany which broach the issue; his article had a significant influence for the whole discussion about circumcision as criminal assault in Germany.

Moreover, privacy is close to the user information and thus, present in any ubiquitous computing scenario. In the context of identity management (IdM), privacy is gaining more importance since IdM systems deal with services that requires sharing attributes belonging to users’ identity with different entities across domains. Consequently, privacy is a fundamental aspect to be addressed by IdM to protect the exchange of user attributes between services and identity providers across different networks and security domains in pervasive computing. However, problems such as the <b>effective</b> revocation <b>consent,</b> have not been fully addressed.

As opportunities to save lives increase with new technologies and procedures, {{the number of people}} willing to donate organs needs to increase as well. In order to respect individual autonomy, voluntary consent must be determined for the individual's disposition of their remains following death. There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: [...] "opt in" [...] (only those who have given explicit consent are donors) and [...] "opt out" [...] (anyone who has not refused consent to donate is a donor). In terms of an opt-out or presumed consent system, it is assumed that individuals do intend to donate their organs to medical use when they expire. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase <b>effective</b> rates of <b>consent</b> for donation (the so-called default effect).

Effective translation will require ongoing efforts {{in a number of areas}} including: selection of appropriate patients, provision of <b>effective</b> <b>consent,</b> pre- and post-test genetic counselling, improving variant interpretation algorithms and practices, and management of secondary findings including those found incidentally and those actively sought. Allied to this is the need for an effective education programme for all members of clinical teams involved in care of patients with rare disease, as well as to maintain public confidence in the use of these technologies. We established a Genomic Medicine Multidisciplinary Team (GM-MDT) in 2014 to build on the experiences of earlier successful research-based WES/WGS studies, to address these needs and to review results including pertinent and secondary findings. Here we report on a qualitative study of decision-making in the GM-MDT combined with analysis of semi-structured interviews with GM-MDT members. Study findings show that members appreciate the clinical and scientific diversity of the GM-MDT and value it for education and oversight. To date, discussions have focussed on case selection including the extent and interpretation of clinical and family history information required to establish likely monogenic aetiology and inheritance model.

40|$|Fiduciary law {{necessarily}} raises {{issues of}} delineation and demarcation, which this paper demonstrates through examples involving common-law agents. Serving as an agent, and thus as a fiduciary, {{does not necessarily}} mean that agency law prescribes all duties that the agent owes the principal. The agent may have rights external to the relationship that the agent may exercise, distinct from the duty of loyalty owed the principal. When an agent acts outside the bounds of an agency relationship, the principal’s consent is not requisite to conduct that would constitute disloyalty within the bounds of the agency relationship. The paper illustrates the significance of this point through a series of examples drawn from a range of contexts, including auctions of art objects. Prior scholarship neglects the implications of demarcations that define the scope of an agency relationship and of fiduciary relationships more generically. More generally or theoretically, the paper examines the qualities of fiduciary duty as a default rule, arguing that the relative “stickiness” of the default varies. Agency law contains two different kinds of altering rules—necessary and sufficient conditions to vary a default rule—consisting of agreements that define the scope of the agent’s representative role on behalf of the principal, and consent by the principal to actions by the agent within that scope that relieve the agent of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, which impose significantly different requisites. The basic distinction between agreement and consent has parallels elsewhere in agency law; for example, ratification, like consent, requires specificity because to be legally effective ratification requires that the principal know, as a matter of historical fact, what the agent has done. Agreement, on the other hand, requires less specificity, comparable to manifestations that confer actual authority on an agent which necessarily does not require that the principal foresee all actions that the agent may take that fall within the scope of the grant of authority. And ratification, like <b>effective</b> <b>consent,</b> is a matter of historical fact, not hypothesis. These implications follow because agency law, by positioning an agent as the principal’s representative for purposes of legally-salient interactions with third parties and facts about the world, frames the agent as an extension of the principal, not the principal’s substitute...|$|E

40|$|If we {{slightly}} {{change the}} facts of the story about the discouraging doctor, it becomes a story that happens every day. Abortion patients face attempts to discourage them from terminating their pregnancies like those the imaginary doctor used, as well as others-and state laws mandate these attempts. While the law of every state requires health care professionals to secure the informed consent of the patient before any medical intervention, over half of the states place additional requirements on legally <b>effective</b> informed <b>consent</b> for abortion. These laws sometimes include features that have ethical problems, such as giving patients deceptive information. Unique informed consent requirements for abortion are depicted by their supporters as necessary for fully informed and voluntary consent to abortion. They are purported to protect health by regulating the practice of medicine. But their worst features are detrimental both to the goals of the doctrine of informed consent and to women 2 ̆ 7 s health. I refer to these laws as 2 ̆ 2 biased counseling laws 2 ̆ 2 because they are not intended to ensure that patients give their informed consent to abortion, but rather are intended to make women less likely to terminate their pregnancy. I employ a broad definition of biased counseling laws; for my purposes, any law that is intended to discourage women from deciding to obtain abortions is a biased counseling law. However, not all abortion- specific consent laws are equally ethically problematic. Thus, my argument will focus on certain features of biased counseling laws. This Article contributes to the literature by examining in detail the most problematic features of biased counseling laws, collecting and explaining some of the most influential ethical accounts of informed consent, and demonstrating the deep ethical problems with biased counseling laws. Legal scholars have previously argued that biased counseling laws are unconstitutional because they impose an undue burden on the right to terminate a pregnancy, they violate the First Amendment, and they constitute sex discrimination.

There is, however, no widely agreed definition of community engagement or of approaches adopted. Justifications given for its use also vary. Community engagement is, for example, variously seen to be of value in: the development of more <b>effective</b> and appropriate <b>consent</b> processes; improved understanding of the aims and forms of research; higher recruitment rates; the identification of important ethical issues; the building of better relationships between the community and researchers; the obtaining of community permission to approach potential research participants; and, the provision of better health care. Despite these diverse and potentially competing claims made for the importance of community engagement, there is very little published evidence on effective models of engagement or their evaluation. Methods. In this paper, drawing upon interviews with the members of a Community Advisory Board on the Thai-Myanmar border, we describe and critically reflect upon an approach to community engagement which was developed in the context of international collaborative research in the border region. Results and conclusions. Drawing on our analysis, we identify a number of considerations relevant to the development of an approach to evaluating community engagement in this complex research setting. The paper also identifies a range of important ways in which the Community Advisory Board is in practice understood by its members (and perhaps by community members beyond this) to have morally significant roles and responsibilities beyond those usually associated with the successful and appropriate conduct of research. © 2014 Maung Lwin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

The achievement of high specific activities during procedures has been indicated as the critical factor to <b>consent</b> <b>effective</b> therapy. Several radiochemical factors may negatively impact reaction procedures such as pH, temperature and time of reaction. Our study was undertaken to {{explore the influence of}} radiochemical parameters, such as time of incubation, on reaction kinetics during the radiolabelling of DOTATATE with (90) Y. METHODS: Forty-five radiolabelling procedures were carried out using small volumes of yttrium- 90, typically 60 - 78 μL. At nearly constant pH and temperature two different settings of radiolabelling procedures were implemented, removing the products from the heating water bath approximately after 30 min (group E, early; n= 20) and after 39 min (group L, later; n= 25). Quality controls were performed by means of both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). RESULTS: Reaction kinetics for (90) Y were found to a provide suitable percentage of incorporation at pH 4. 5 for both groups. Reaction temperature was not different between groups E and L. A significant difference was found between the two groups in radiochemical yield, which was 95. 6 % ± 0. 8 for group E and 98. 2 % ± 1. 1 for group L (p< 0. 0001). The specific activity of the final product was 46. 9 MBq/nmol.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the factors affecting consent to organ donation in families of brain death patients in hospitals affiliated with Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences. For this purpose, a self-made questionnaire was distributed among 54 family members of brain death patients admitted in hospitals affiliated with Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences between 2003 and 2013. The data were reported as mean, frequency and percentage using the SPSS 16 software. The average age of the deceased was 31. 38 ± 13. 72 years, and car accidents were the most frequent cause of brain death (59. 3 %) in this study. In addition, 72. 2 % of the deceased were male and 90. 7 % of them lived in or around the city of Shahrekord. About 37 % of the families consented to organ donation. The average age of the family members who participated in the study was 42. 15 ± 8. 9 years. The most frequent reasons affecting families’ consent to organ donation were religious rewards (100 %), confidence in the medical team and staff (100 %), and confidence in physician diagnosis (100 %). The findings of the study show that religion, faith and family ties affect the willingness for organ donation, and therefore specific attention should be given to these factors in educational programs.
