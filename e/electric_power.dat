5|$|A Carbon Trust study {{into the}} {{potential}} of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> (0.4% of total UK <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid <b>electric</b> <b>power,</b> around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> needs by 2050.|$|E

5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of <b>electric</b> <b>power,</b> competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of <b>electric</b> <b>power,</b> wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> to national electrical networks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable <b>electric</b> <b>power.</b> In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, on {{particularly}} windy days, {{even with}} penetration levels of 16%, wind power generation can surpass all other <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> sources in a country. In Spain, {{in the early}} hours of 16 April 2012 wind power production reached the highest percentage of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> production till then, at 60.46% of the total demand. In Denmark, which had power market penetration of 30% in 2013, over 90hours, wind power generated 100% of the country's power, peaking at 122% of the country's demand at 2am on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a much weaker storm upon {{impacting}} Russia, Saomai's rains flooded coal retrieval sites, {{cutting down}} on <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> supplies in Primorsky Krai. Due to the shortages, <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> was transferred there from other surrounding areas. Furthermore, a 50percent decrease in electricity output was documented at the local power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60people. Overall, 55automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76people injured.|$|E
