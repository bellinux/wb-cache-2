40|$|Replacement of gluten in GF foods {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} to the cereal technologist and baker alike, and {{has led to the}} search for alternatives to gluten in the manufacture of gluten-free bakery products. The aim of the present thesis was the manufacture of GF cereal based products with higher quality characteristics and improved nutritional value compared to those products available on the market. Αlso to study dough rheological properties and bread quality characteristics and try to solve the major problems of GF bread. Addition of rice, corn, and soy flour to bread and durum wheat flours at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 % levels was carried out to examine the effects on the baking (specific volume, color, firmness) and sensory characteristics of bread. Dough rheological properties were also studied using Brabender Farinograph and Extensograph. Results of the present study suggest that incorporation of rice, flour up to a level of 50 % and corn, and soy flour up to a level of 30 %(flour basis) produces low <b>gluten</b> <b>bread</b> without any negative effect in quality attributes such as color, hardness, and flavor and reasonable acceptance offering promising nutritious and healthy alternative to consumers. The GF formulation contained 25 % corn starch, 75 % rice flour, 2 % salt, 4 %sucrose and 4 % sunflower oil. Breads made with gluten-free flour are usually characterized by poor color and baking characteristics, as well as short shelf life. This study was conducted to help solve these problems by using raisin juice, hydrocolloids, dietary fibres and proteins. Response surface methodology was used to optimize a GF bread formulation based on ingredients such as maize starch and rice flour which are naturally GF. The optimal formulation, determined from the data, contained 1. 5 kg/ 100 kg HPMC and 88. 7 kg/ 100 kg Water, corn starch-rice flour blend basis (sfb). In the final study, proteins from different sources (soya, milk) were added individually to a gluten-free bread formulation based on rice flour and corn starch. The effect of their inclusion on baking characteristics was studied. The breads were packed in a modified atmosphere (30 % CO 2 / 70 % N 2) and stored for 2, 4, 6 and 8 days. Testing was carried out and the effects of the added proteins plus the modified atmosphere were studied. The addition of 10 % soy protein concentrate yielded firm doughs and breads which had low loaf volume, darker color and a compact crumb texture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{consumption}} of gluten free foods is increasing in today’s society and consumers are demanding more from their gluten free products. Consumers {{are also looking}} for local alternatives to conventionally produced foods. This study compares the sensory aspects of industrially processed <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread</b> and locally produced, artisanal <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread.</b> Three breads were purchased from grocery stores and three from local bakeries. Global Napping® and ultra flash profiling were used to identify the overall {{differences between the two}} different categories of <b>gluten</b> free <b>breads.</b> Partial Napping® and ultra flash profiling were also used to determine if there were any differences between flavor and texture of the breads. Twelve panelists, who regularly consume bread, evaluated all six of the bread samples. Both methods indicated that there are many differences between the industrially processed and artisanal <b>gluten</b> free <b>breads.</b> The main differences being artisanal breads were associated with a wide array of flavors and a dry texture, while the industrially processed breads were found to be bland in flavor and moist.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} <b>gluten</b> free <b>breads</b> are of {{low quality}} {{and have a}} rapid staling during storage, therefore {{attempts were made to}} obtain <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread</b> of improved structure properties and extended shelf-life. For this purpose laboratory obtained bean starch, both native or hydrothermally modified, was added to a gluten free formulation. Texture results revealed differences between the bottom-harder, and upper-softer part of fresh bread containing native bean starch. Modified starch reduced the hardness and diminish the differences between the upper and the bottom part of bread slice. Independently of storage duration breads were crumbly. Considerable decrease of the peak and final viscosity was observed with the increase of the storage time in sample with native bean starch, whereas the presence of modified starch induced the opposite tendency. The addition of native starch increased the tendency of amylopectine to retrograde during storage, whereas the presence of modified starch decreased the retrogradation enthalpy by 16 %. PRACTICAL APPLICATION <b>Gluten</b> free <b>breads</b> exhibite dry crumbling crumb, poor mouthfeel and flavour. To gain approval, <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread</b> need to resemble wheat flour bread.

Chickpea based doughs showed low consistency and their rheological behavior was defined by the starch gelatinization and gelification. The bread made with cooked chickpea flour exhibited the lowest specific volume (0. 58 mL/g), brightest crumb (L*= 76. 20) and softest texture, but cooking decreased the content of carbohydrates, ashes and proteins, although increased the protein digestibility. The highest specific volume was obtained in bread made with toasted chickpea flour, although crumb hardness was higher.

40|$|The {{impact of}} dough {{hydration}} level and {{particle size distribution}} of the rice flour on the <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread</b> quality and in vitro starch hydrolysis was studied. Rice flour was fractionated in fine and coarse parts and mixed with different amounts of water (70 %, 90 % and 110 % hydration levels) {{and the rest of}} ingredients used for making <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread.</b> A larger bread specific volume was obtained when coarser fraction and great dough hydration (90 - 110 %) were combined. The crumb texture improved when increasing dough hydration, although that effect was more pronounced when breads were obtained from a fine fraction. The estimated glycaemic index was higher in breads with higher hydration (90 - 110 %). Slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) increased in the coarse flour breads. The coarse fraction complemented with a great dough hydration (90 - 110 %) was the most suitable combination for developing rice bread when considering the bread volume and crumb texture.

Moreover, sorghum does not contain gluten and has potential in the gluten-free market. A blend of non-wheat flour, starch and hydrocolloid typically provide the structure of gluten-free products. Most research on sorghum bread uses a yeast leavened process, HPMC gum, rice flour and corn, potato, or tapioca starch. Little is known about the functionality or interactions of different starches and hydrocolloids in sorghum batter. The objectives of this study were to examine starch-hydrocolloid interaction in chemically leavened gluten free sorghum bread; to evaluate the effects of different ingredients on <b>gluten</b> free <b>bread</b> quality made with sorghum flour: starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) : hydrocolloid (HPMC, locust bean gum and xanthan) and to develop a chemically leavened <b>gluten</b> free sorghum <b>bread</b> method. Bread was baked as pup loaves. Volume index was measured using the AACCI Method 10 - 91. 01 template, crumb grain was evaluated using the C-Cell Imaging System and texture was determined with the TA. XT Plus Texture Analyzer. The base formula was commercial sorghum flour, water, starch, hydrocolloid, sugar, salt, shortening and double acting baking powder. Sorghum flour: starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) ratios of 70 : 30, 80 : 20 and 90 : 10 were tested. Loaves containing all levels of rice flour had the same volume index (~ 165) as 100 % sorghum flour (168) while all levels of tapioca starch and potato starch produced significantly smaller loaves (~ 150). The ratio of 90 % sorghum flour and 10 % starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) was selected. The type and level of hydrocolloid significantly impacted loaf volume, grain and texture. Starch-hydrocolloid combinations which produced the best loaves were tapioca starch + 3 % HPMC, rice flour + 3 % xanthan and potato starch + 4 % xanthan. Following initial optimization experiment, egg ingredients, fat, baking powder and water were added and evaluated individually to develop an optimized formulation. In general, addition of egg ingredients, shortening and oil did not improve the overall quality of sorghum based bread and were not added to the formula. However, emulsified shortening was effective. The best level of emulsified shortening was determined to be 3 % for the breads with sorghum flour: tapioca starch or sorghum flour: potato starch and 5 % for bread made with sorghum flour: rice flour.

50|$|Glutenin and gliadin are {{functional}} proteins {{found in}} wheat bread {{that contribute to}} the structure of bread.

The glutenin protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.|$|R

The peptide fraction at a concentration of 1 g/L of culture medium was able to agglutinate 30 % of K 562 (S) cells, suggesting a moderate toxic effect. This toxicity may {{be accounted for by}} homologies in amino acid sequences between glutenin subunits and /β-and -gliadin...|$|R
