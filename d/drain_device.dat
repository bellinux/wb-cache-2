During days following the injury, a high-output biliary fistula has been recognized. Practically, {{the total amount of}} bile produced in a day (700  mL) was drained out of the body. However, after image-guided percutaneous drainage, the clinical condition improved and the patient became asymptomatic. In addition, MRI revealed only minimal free fluid in the abdomen, demonstrating an adequately functioning <b>draining</b> <b>device.</b> Nevertheless, the only issue of concern was the position of this drain in the recto-vesical pouch, thus permitting the bile to contaminate the entire abdomen before being eliminated from there.

40|$|Abstract. People-centric sensing and {{user state}} {{recognition}} can provide rich contextual information for various mobile applications and services. However, continuously capturing this contextual information on mobile <b>devices</b> <b>drains</b> <b>device</b> battery very quickly. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between device energy consumption and user state recognition accuracy from a novel perspective. We assume the user state evolves as a hidden discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) and an embedded sensor on mobile device discovers user state by performing a sensing observation. We investigate a stationary deterministic sensor sampling policy which assigns different sensor duty cycles based on different user states, and propose two state estimation mechanisms providing the best “guess ” of user state sequence when observations are missing. We analyze {{the effect of}} varying sensor duty cycles on (a) device energy consumption and (b) user state estimation error, and visualize the tradeoff between the two numerically for a two-state setting.

40|$|Abstract—The DoD {{vision of}} {{real-time}} information sharing and net-centric services available to warfighters at the tactical edge is challenged by low-bandwidth and high-latency tactical network links. Secured tactical applications require transmission of digital certificates that contribute {{a major portion}} of data in most secure sessions, which further increases response time for users and <b>drains</b> <b>device</b> power. In this paper we present a simple and practical approach to alleviating this problem. We develop a dictionary of data common across DoD PKI certificates to prime general-purpose data compression of certificates, resulting in a significant reduction (about 50 %) of certificate sizes. This reduction in message size translates in to faster response times for the users. For example, a mutual authentication of a client and a server over the Iridium satellite link is expected to be sped up by as much as 3 sec. This approach can be added directly to tactical applications with minimal effort, or it can be deployed as part of an intercepting network proxy, completely transparent to applications. I...|$|R

50|$|Ongoing {{technological}} advances in rechargeable batteries and battery chargers, means most single-use alkaline batteries can largely {{be replaced with}} higher capacity, environmentally preferable, rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries. Rechargeable batteries will outperform the best alkaline single-use batteries in high-drain appliances such as digital cameras. Rechargeable batteries may not {{last as long as}} alkaline batteries on a single charge in low drain (e.g. radio), medium drain (e.g. MD player), and pulse <b>drain</b> <b>devices</b> (e.g. photoflash); but NiMH batteries can be reused over several hundred times while alkaline batteries can be used only once. NiMH rechargeable batteries do not have what is commonly referred to as 'memory effect' so they can be recharged at any time. The main environmental concerns of batteries are the harmful materials they contain, such as Mercury (Hg), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb). Batteries containing these materials need to be carefully disposed of to avoid the harmful effects on human health and environment. Canadians buy over 150 million batteries per year. It takes less energy to recharge a battery than to produce a new one. Using metal recovered from batteries consumes 75 percent less energy and 46 percent less energy than extracting it from primary sources.|$|R

5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held {{a hearing}} on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood <b>draining</b> <b>device</b> was intended to look very unrealistic to mitigate the violence.

40|$|Radioimmunoassay (RIA) {{employing}} iodinated ligands {{represents a}} popular measurement method for small molecules {{due to its}} excellent sensitivity and specificity. Yet performing RIAs {{of large numbers of}} tubes remains a tedious laboratory chore due to the need to individually handle tubes multiple times. We here present a method in which conventional 125 I-labeled RIA ([125 I] RIA) is adapted to a microtiter plate format, termed mini-RIA. Tubes are handled in batch for centrifugation or during the separation of antibody-bound ligand from free ligand. A simple <b>draining</b> <b>device</b> for batch decantation of free ligand from 96 minitubes is used. Optimal conditions for the mini-RIA were established using two workup methods—double-antibody immunoprecipitation and direct polyethylene glycol precipitation. Use of the mini-RIA method was found to result in a considerable savings in assay times; in addition, the sensitivity of the mini-RIA was improved over conventional RIA. The mini-RIA is particularly useful for assay of large numbers of samples derived from chromatographic methods, since aliquots can be transferred directly from the fraction collector into the minitubes using multiple channel pipettors. Because the method is flexible with regard to assay workup, we predict that most conventional [125 I] RIAs can be adapted to the mini-RIA format. 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract-A new {{characterization}} method is proposed {{to study the}} relationship between the hot-carrier-induced interface state I V ~ ~ (X) and the <b>device</b> <b>drain</b> current degradation of submicron LDD n-MOSFET’s.

The time evolution of the interface state generation and its correlation with the device degradation can then be well explained. It is worthwhile to note that this newly-developed method requires no repetitive charge pumping measurements, and hence avoids he likely imposition of re-stress on tested devices. By combining the characterized Ldam and quantitatively, the results show that the damage at T’GS z T/bs/ 2 is most highly localized among various stress biases, which can explain why the generated interface states will dominate the <b>device</b> <b>drain</b> current degradation at this bias after long-term operating conditions...|$|R

In the presence of perpendicular magnetic field, the Lorentz force makes possible switching from one electromechanical state to another.

Integrated use of erythropoietin, cell saver, and/or postoperative <b>drain</b> reinfusion <b>devices</b> on allogeneic erythrocyte use was evaluated using a restrictive transfusion threshold. Methods: In a factorial design, adult elective hip- And knee-surgery patients with hemoglobin levels 10 to 13 g/dl (n = 683) were randomized for erythropoietin or not, and subsequently for autologous reinfusion by cell saver or postoperative <b>drain</b> reinfusion <b>devices</b> or for no blood salvage device. Primary outcomes were mean allogeneic intra- And postoperative erythrocyte use and proportion of transfused patients (transfusion rate). Secondary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Results: With erythropoietin (n = 339), mean erythrocyte use was 0. 50 units (U) /patient and transfusion rate 16 % while without (n = 344), these were 0. 71 U/patient and 26 %, respectively. Consequently, erythropoietin resulted in a nonsignificant 29 % mean erythrocyte reduction (ratio, 0. 71; 95 % CI, 0. 42 to 1. 13) and 50 % reduction of transfused patients (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 35 to 0. 75). Erythropoietin increased costs by € 785 per patient (95 % CI, 262 to 1, 309), that is, € 7, 300 per avoided transfusion (95 % CI, 1, 900 to 24, 000). With autologous reinfusion, mean erythrocyte use was 0. 65 U/patient and transfusion rate was 19 % with erythropoietin (n = 214) and 0. 76 U/patient and 29 % without (n = 206).
