5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a <b>half-cell</b> which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The <b>half-cell</b> has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} an uneven {{distribution}} of cations and anions, {{there will be a}} small voltage called <b>half-cell</b> potential associated with the current. In the DC system that is used by the ECG and EEG instruments, the difference between the <b>half-cell</b> potential and the zero potential is shown as DC offset which is an undesirable characteristic. Silver/silver chloride is a popular choice of biological electrodes due to its low <b>half-cell</b> potential of approximately 220 mV and the lower of the impedance of the electrode by silver chloride.|$|E
5000|$|The {{margins of}} the notch present several <b>half-cells</b> which, when united with {{corresponding}} <b>half-cells</b> on the upper surface of the ethmoid, complete the ethmoidal air cells.|$|R
25|$|A {{concentration}} cell is an electrochemical cell {{where the two}} electrodes are the same material, the electrolytes on the two <b>half-cells</b> involve the same ions, but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two <b>half-cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{concentration}} cell generates electricity from {{the reduction in}} the thermodynamic free energy of the electrochemical system as the difference in the chemical concentrations in the two <b>half-cells</b> is reduced. The same reaction occurs in the <b>half-cells</b> but in opposite directions, increasing the lower and decreasing the higher concentration. The energy is generated from thermal energy that the cell absorbs as heat, as the electricity flows. This generation of electricity from ambient thermal energy, without a temperature gradient, is possible because the convergence of the chemical concentrations in the two <b>half-cells</b> increases entropy, and this increase more than compensates for the entropy decrease when heat is converted into electrical energy.|$|R
25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One <b>half-cell</b> includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other <b>half-cell</b> includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each <b>half-cell.</b> A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{corrosion}} of concrete-covered {{steel and}} iron {{can cause the}} concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems. It {{is one of the}} most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges. Measuring instruments based on the <b>half-cell</b> potential can detect the potential corrosion spots before total failure of the concrete structure is reached.|$|E
500|$|With a {{standard}} electrode potential (SEP) of −0.76 volts, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries [...] ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of zinc–carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc-air battery/fuel cell. The zinc-cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative <b>half-cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other fuel cells, {{biological}} {{photovoltaic systems}} {{are divided into}} anodic and cathodic <b>half-cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|A salt bridge (e.g., {{filter paper}} soaked in KNO3, NaCl, {{or some other}} electrolyte) is often {{employed}} to provide ionic contact between two <b>half-cells</b> with different electrolytes, yet prevent the solutions from mixing and causing unwanted side reactions. An alternative to a salt bridge is to allow direct contact (and mixing) between the two <b>half-cells,</b> for example in simple electrolysis of water.|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{electropolish}} niobium with continuous current oscillation is introduced. The current continuously oscillates {{for as long}} as 3 hours. The key is to maintain continuous agitation of the acid mixture. A niobium surface treated by this method has suppressed grain boundaries and a lower hydrogen content. The method has been used to electropolish L-band <b>half-cells.</b> The test results of a 1500 MHz cavity made of electropolished <b>half-cells</b> are presented...|$|R
500|$|Cave 17 {{comprises}} {{a series}} of three small dwellings located along a row with a shared veranda. The first dwelling has a doorway flanked by broken windows on either side, leading to a middle room. The back room of the middle dwelling has a cell to the right and a half cell to the left. A window is located to left of door to the cell. The cell also has traces of painting. The half cell has a bench. The second dwelling has a middle room, a half cell to the left, and a cell, reached from the right of the half cell. The middle room has a bench. The half cell has a recess in its back wall, along with a bench. A grooved door leads from the <b>half-cell</b> to the cell, which also has a bench. A window in the right cell overlooks in to the middle room. In front of the doorway is a bench. The third and largest of the three dwellings consists of a middle hall. At the back wall of the hall there are two cells and two seat recesses. Along the right and rear walls runs a bench. The right cell as well as the left cell have grooved doorways, a window {{to the left of the}} doorway and a bench along each of their rear walls. In front of the hall door is a bench. In front of the broken veranda are holes for fixing wooden pillars. To the left of the veranda are two cisterns. Between cave 17 and cave 18, there are three other cisterns. In the recess of the first cistern, an inscription reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Saghaka a goldsmith, son of Kudira of Kalyana." [...] Another inscription in the recess of the second cistern reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Lachhinika (wife) of Torika the Na daka [...] Nadabalika, wife of Isimulasami." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{a stream}} of oxygen is {{delivered}} to the cathode side of the MEA. At the cathode side oxygen molecules react with the protons permeating through the polymer electrolyte membrane and the electrons arriving through the external circuit to form water molecules. This reduction <b>half-cell</b> reaction or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is represented by: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{vanadium}} redox battery {{consists of}} an assembly of power cells {{in which the two}} electrolytes are separated by a proton exchange membrane. Both electrolytes are vanadium-based, the electrolyte in the positive <b>half-cells</b> contains VO2+ and VO2+ ions, the electrolyte in the negative <b>half-cells,</b> V3+ and V2+ ions. The electrolytes may be prepared by any of several processes, including electrolytically dissolving vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The solution remains strongly acidic in use.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} E° {{in this kind}} of cell is zero, as {{electrodes}} and ions are the same in both <b>half-cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|A porous disk {{or other}} porous barrier {{between the two}} <b>half-cells</b> may be used instead of a salt bridge; however, they {{basically}} serve the same purpose.|$|R
2500|$|Research into {{electrode}} materials requires {{measurement of}} individual components, {{such as an}} electrode or <b>half-cell.</b> By using a counterelectrode that {{does not affect the}} measurements, the characteristics of only the electrode of interest can be revealed. Specific energy and power for real supercapacitors only have more or less roughly 1/3 of the electrode density.|$|E
2500|$|Each <b>half-cell</b> has an {{electromotive}} force (emf), determined by {{its ability to}} drive electric current from the interior to {{the exterior of the}} cell. The net emf of the cell is the difference between the emfs of its half-cells. Thus, if the electrodes have emfs [...] and , then the net emf is in other words, the net emf is the difference between the reduction potentials of the half-reactions.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Nernst-Lewis-Latimer {{convention}} (1), {{the sign}} of the potential is determined by the change of {{the sign of}} the standard Gibbs free energy of the <b>half-cell</b> reaction. This reaction transfers nF of the positive electric charge across the phase boundary from the left {{to the right of the}} <b>half-cell,</b> as shown in the <b>half-cell</b> diagram. The relation is written as:where: ...|$|E

50|$|A {{concentration}} cell {{is a limited}} form of a galvanic cell that has two equivalent <b>half-cells</b> of the same composition differing only in concentrations. One can calculate the potential developed by such a cell using the Nernst Equation. A {{concentration cell}} produces a small voltage as it attempts to reach chemical equilibrium, which occurs when the concentration of reactant in both <b>half-cells</b> are equal. Because {{an order of magnitude}} concentration difference produces less than 60 millivolts at room temperature, concentration cells are not typically used for energy storage.|$|R
40|$|Dumbbell {{fabrication}} is a mid-process for manufa-cturing an elliptical superconducting RF cavity. Control of the dumbbell’s {{length and}} TM 010 π mode frequencies {{is necessary to}} build up a desired cavity. A new method was used to measure and calculate the frequencies of the individual <b>half-cells</b> of a PEFP low-beta dumbbell exactly, and to tune the frequency and length of the <b>half-cells.</b> A LabView program was used to measure the dumbbell frequencies of the TM 010 modes. The tuning method and results of the PEFP low-beta dumbbells are presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|Rockwood's {{approach}} to absolute-electrode thermodynamics is easily expendable to other thermodynamic functions. For example, the absolute <b>half-cell</b> entropy {{has been defined}} as the entropy of the absolute <b>half-cell</b> process defined above. An alternative definition of the absolute <b>half-cell</b> entropy has recently been published by Fang et al. who define it as the entropy of the following reaction (using the hydrogen electrode as an example): ...|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} <b>half-cell,</b> used in electrochemistry, {{consists of}} a metal electrode in a 1 molar (1 mol/L) aqueous solution of the metal's salt, at 298 kelvin (25 °C). The electrochemical series, which consists of standard electrode potentials and {{is closely related to}} the reactivity series, was generated by measuring the difference in potential between the metal <b>half-cell</b> in a circuit with a standard hydrogen <b>half-cell,</b> connected by a salt bridge.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{potential}} can {{be predicted}} {{through the use}} of electrode potentials (the voltages of each <b>half-cell).</b> These <b>half-cell</b> potentials are defined relative to the assignment of 0 volts to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). (See table of standard electrode potentials). The difference in voltage between electrode potentials gives a prediction for the potential measured. When calculating the difference in voltage, one must first rewrite the <b>half-cell</b> reaction equations to obtain a balanced oxidation-reduction equation.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of a {{range of}} halide and titanium halide redox couple combinations has been evaluated for potential application in redox flow cells employing common elements in both <b>half-cells.</b> Cyclic voltammetry and cell cycling measurements were employed to establish the reversibility of the redox couples and the expected cell voltage and performance in a redox flow cell. An all iodine cell was found to be impractical due to the formation of an insoluble iodine deposit in the cell that caused cell blockage. A titanium polyhalide cell that uses a solution of TiCl 4 in HBr/HCl supporting electrolyte in both <b>half-cells</b> was, however, shown to produce an open circuit voltage of 0. 9 V and high coulombic efficiencies. Although the voltage efficiency of the cell was low, improvements in cell design may reduce ohmic losses allowing much higher energy efficiencies to be achieved. This cell is equivalent to the vanadium bromide cell that employs a vanadium bromide solution in both <b>half-cells.</b> The lower price of titanium, however, opens the possibility of a significant cost benefit for the titanium polyhalide redox flow cell...|$|R

50|$|An {{electrochemical}} cell {{consists of two}} half-cells. Each <b>half-cell</b> consists of an electrode and an electrolyte. The two half-cells may use the same electrolyte, or they may use different electrolytes. The chemical reactions in the cell may involve the electrolyte, the electrodes, or an external substance (as in fuel cells that may use hydrogen gas as a reactant). In a full {{electrochemical cell}}, species from one <b>half-cell</b> lose electrons (oxidation) to their electrode while species from the other <b>half-cell</b> gain electrons (reduction) from their electrode.|$|E
