60|$|They {{immediately}} began to hold secret consultations {{for the purpose of}} determining how it was best to proceed, first binding themselves by the most solemn oaths never to betray one another, however their undertaking might end. Darius told them that he had himself discovered the imposture and usurpation of Smerdis, and that he had come from Persia for the purpose of slaying him; and that now, since it appeared that the secret was known to so many, he was of opinion that they ought to act at once with the utmost decision. He thought there would be great <b>danger</b> <b>in</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Moffat was {{now coming}} down to Courcy Castle to look after his electioneering interests, and Miss Gresham was to return with her aunt to meet him. The countess was very anxious that Frank should also {{accompany}} them. Her great doctrine, that he must marry money, had been laid down with authority, and received without doubt. She now pushed it further, and said that no time should be lost; {{that he should not}} only marry money, but do so very early in life; there was always <b>danger</b> <b>in</b> <b>delay.</b> The Greshams--of course she alluded only to the males of the family--were foolishly soft-hearted; no one could say what might happen. There was that Miss Thorne always at Greshamsbury.|$|E

6000|$|The {{eyes of the}} {{assembly}} were now turned upon Waverley, who {{took the opportunity to}} beg the smith to shoe his guide's horse with all speed, as he wished to proceed on his journey; for he had heard enough to make him sensible that there would be <b>danger</b> <b>in</b> <b>delaying</b> long <b>in</b> this place. The smith's eyes rested on him with a look of displeasure and suspicion, not lessened by the eagerness with which his wife enforced Waverley's mandate.

5000|$|Periculum in mora, Latin for [...] "danger in delay", {{is one of}} two {{conditions}} which must be asserted in actions aimed at obtaining a protective order or injunction to be granted the relief sought (the other condition being fumus boni iuris). The second condition is the c.d. Prima facie case. The burden of proof of <b>danger</b> <b>in</b> <b>delay</b> falls to the person who requests the injunction or order, demonstrating the existence of both requirements, pericolum notice, and the risk of suffering serious and irreparable damage.|$|E
5000|$|Peliculu in mora, Latin for [...] "danger in delay", {{is one of}} two {{conditions}} which must be asserted in actions aimed at obtaining a protective order or injunction (e.g. ART.700 former CCP), to be granted the relief sought (the other condition being fumus boni iuris). The second condition is the c.d. Prima facie case.The burden of proof of <b>danger</b> <b>in</b> <b>delay</b> falls to the person who requests the injunction or order, demonstrating the existence of both requirements, pericolum notice, and the risk of suffering serious and irreparable damage.The term 'serious harm' refers to the magnitude of the damages, calculated in relation to the value of the property in dispute: an injury will not be so serious in itself, but only when compared to the object of contention. Irreparable damage is in the possibility of a remedy in the future against which the party seeking the injunction believes they will suffer. Only asset orientation is currently supported, in that the prevailing possibility of obtaining compensation for damages is, in itself, sufficient to prevent the founding of irreparable harm.|$|E
60|$|Lord Robert {{had felt}} the earth to be quaking under him; {{he had seen the}} ruin of his high ambitions; he had watched with rage the {{expanding}} mockery upon the countenances of Norfolk, Sussex, and those others who hated and despised him; and he had cursed that wife of his who knew not when to die. But for that obstinacy with which she clung to life he had been the Queen's husband these many months, so making an end to suspense and to the <b>danger</b> that lies <b>in</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|R
60|$|Madame Duchesne {{had already}} been consulted. She would much rather have {{remained}} until strong enough to walk, but on her old nurse's showing her {{that it would be}} at least a fortnight before she could walk even a mile, and pointing out the <b>danger</b> there was <b>in</b> <b>delay,</b> she agreed to start whenever they thought fit. The jewels were placed in Dinah's capacious pocket, as, if they fell in with any strong party of negroes, she {{would be less likely to}} be searched than the others. In an hour all the preparations were completed; one pistol was given to Madame Duchesne and another to her daughter. Dinah took charge of a brace, and Nat wore the other two brace in his sash. He still wore his uniform under his nankeen suit, and his naval cap was in the bundle that formed Madame Duchesne's pillow. She lay down on the hand-barrow, all the blankets being placed under her, with the exception of one which was thrown over her, and she was let down the precipice in the same way as she had been brought up.|$|R
