5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were to head <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Mole to disembark their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
5|$|Under the Mongols new {{technologies}} and commodities were exchanged across the Old World, particularly Eurasia. Professor Thomas T.Allsen noted many personnel exchanges occurred during the Mongol period. There were many significant developments in economy (especially trade and public finance), military, medicine, agriculture, cuisine, astronomy, printing, geography, and historiography, which were not limited to Eurasia but also included North Africa. The Mongolian Empire functioned as the principal cultural clearing house <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> World until its downturn when it was gradually replaced by maritime Europe which in time came to perform similar offices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> World and the New.|$|E
5|$|As the {{persecution}} worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Northwest, where slavery was prohibited and land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community {{that had already}} settled in what became Ohio and Indiana had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 Coffin accompanied Benjamin White to Indiana and stayed in Indiana with the Whites for about a year. On his return to North Carolina, Coffin brought back reports of Indiana and its prosperity. Convinced that Quakers and slaveholders could not co exist, Coffin {{decided to move to}} Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> country {{and their relationship}} to it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the War of 1812, the {{population}} of St. Louis and the Missouri Territory began expanding quickly. During this expansion land was donated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> St. Louis County Courthouse. The population increase stirred interest in statehood for Missouri, and in 1820, Congress passed the Missouri Compromise, authorizing Missouri's admission as a slave state. The state constitutional convention and first General Assembly met in St. Louis in 1820. Shortly thereafter, St. Louis incorporated as a city, on December 9, 1822. The first mayor of the city was William Carr Lane, and a Board of Aldermen replaced the earlier Board of Trustees. Early city government focused on improvements to the riverfront and health conditions. In addition to a street paving program, the aldermen voted to rename the streets.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lifford, County Donegal, Given's footballing {{career began}} at local amateur side Lifford Celtic where he shot to notoriety for conceding seven goals on his debut.

At 14, his performances for the club attracted attention from Celtic, and {{he was invited to}} train with their youth side during a pre-season tour of Ireland in 1991. Given signed for the club a year later. Despite being named to the substitutes bench <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Firm derby against Rangers on 1 January 1994, Given never made a first-team appearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
