He later became manager of non-league <b>side</b> <b>Harrow</b> Borough, leaving that position in November 2003 after three-and-a-half years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Long primary <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> {{linear motor}} drive {{technology}} is applied in electromagnetic aircraft launch application. Due {{to the structure}} of the secondary board, there is a great room for the improvement of electromagnetic thrust for the long primary <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> linear motor. This paper studies mainly the secondary structures of the long primary <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> linear motor. The results of this paper lead to a better performance of the motor by the transformation of the structural design of the secondary board...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> inline {{diffusion}} {{is compared}} to single sided inline diffusion. We use a Centrotherm inline furnace with its walking string wafer transport system together with a patented liquid phosphorus dopant. Compared to POCl 3 emitter diffusion, single sided inline diffusion led often to lower efficiencies. We observed that this efficiency can be raised by a <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> inline diffusion. High resolution light beam induced current (LBIC) topograms show which parts of the solar cell are improved by the <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> diffusion. The effect is investigated for different diffusion temperatures and times...|$|R

50|$|Born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Evans {{started his}} career with the Sheffield United youth system as a trainee before signing a {{professional}} contract on 3 July 1995. He made no appearances for the side before joining Crystal Palace on a free transfer on 14 June 1996, and was loaned out to Isthmian League <b>side</b> <b>Harrow</b> Borough in August.

40|$|We have {{successfully}} synthesized highly dense and well aligned zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) {{on the two}} sides of a PEDOT: PSS substrate by a single step low temperature hydrothermal method. The grown sample was used to fabricate a <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG). The maximum harvested output power density from the fabricated <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG configuration was about 4. 44 mW cm(- 2). The results obtained from the present <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG were approximately double the output from a single side. In addition to that, the voltage polarity of the harvested voltage from {{the two sides of}} the NG has been investigated. The results showed that upon bending, an anisotropic voltage polarity is generated on the two sides. Indicating that, this <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG can be used as a self-powered voltage polarity based direction sensor. The results of the present flexible <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG is very promising for harvesting energy from irregular mechanical energy sources in the surrounding environment. In addition, the fabricated configuration showed stability for sensing and can be used in surveillance and security applications.
