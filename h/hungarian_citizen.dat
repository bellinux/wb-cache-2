The retrospective law provided that anyone who had been born within Hungary in the period 1941 to 1945 automatically became a <b>Hungarian</b> <b>citizen,</b> and citizenship in Hungary is passed down by birth right. As his mother was born in Hungary in 1943, an argument was raised that this meant Frydenberg held Hungarian citizenship.
