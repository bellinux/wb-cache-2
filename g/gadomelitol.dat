40|$|Abstract Background High {{interstitial}} fluid pressure (IFP) {{in the primary}} tumor is associated with poor disease-free survival in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. A noninvasive assay is needed to identify cervical cancer patients with highly elevated tumor IFP because these patients may benefit from particularly aggressive treatment. It {{has been suggested that}} dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) with gadolinium diethylene-triamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) as contrast agent may provide useful information on the IFP of cervical carcinomas. In this preclinical study, we investigated whether DCE-MRI with contrast agents with higher molecular weights (MW) than Gd-DTPA would be superior to Gd-DTPA-based DCE-MRI. Methods CK- 160 human cervical carcinoma xenografts were subjected to DCE-MRI with Gd-DTPA (MW of 0. 55 kDa) or <b>gadomelitol</b> (MW of 6. 5 kDa) as contrast agent before tumor IFP was measured invasively with a Millar SPC 320 catheter. The DCE-MRI was carried out at a spatial resolution of 0. 23 [*]×[*] 0. 23 [*]×[*] 2. 0 mm 3 and a time resolution of 14 s by using a 1. 5 -T whole-body scanner and a slotted tube resonator transceiver coil constructed for mice. Parametric images were derived from the DCE-MRI recordings by using the Tofts iso-directional transport model and the Patlak uni-directional transport model. Results When <b>gadomelitol</b> was used as contrast agent, significant positive correlations were found between the parameters of both pharmacokinetic models and tumor IFP. On the other hand, significant correlations between DCE-MRI-derived parameters and IFP could not be detected with Gd-DTPA as contrast agent. Conclusion <b>Gadomelitol</b> is a superior contrast agent to Gd-DTPA in DCE-MRI of the IFP of CK- 160 cervical carcinoma xenografts. Clinical studies attempting to develop DCE-MRI-based assays of the IFP of cervical carcinomas should involve contrast agents with higher MW than Gd-DTPA. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To assess which MRI-derived kinetic {{parameters}} reflect decreased transvascular and interstitial transport when low- and high-molecular-weight {{agents are}} used in rat hepatocellular carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic MRI after injection of a low-molecular-weight contrast agent of 0. 56 kDa (Gd-DOTA, gadoterate) and two high-molecular-weight contrast agents of 6. 47 kDa (P 792, <b>gadomelitol)</b> and 52 kDa (P 717, carboxymethyldextran Gd-DOTA) was performed in rats with chemically induced hepatocellular carcinomas. The data were analyzed with the Kety compartmental model, the extended Kety compartmental model {{in which it is}} assumed that the tissue voxels contain a vascular component, and the St Lawrence and Lee distributed-parameter model. RESULTS: The extravascular extracellular space accessible to the contrast agent v(e) and the extraction fraction E decreased with increasing molecular weight of the contrast agent. In contrast, the volume transfer constant Ktrans did not differ significantly when low- or high-molecular-weight agents were used. CONCLUSION: In this animal model the results suggest that the accessible extravascular extracellular space and the extraction fraction are more sensitive indicators of decreased transvascular and interstitial transport with high-molecular-weight agents than the volume transfer constant, which is a lumped representation of blood flow and permeability.

40|$|Dynamic MR {{biomarkers}} (T 2 *-weighted or susceptibility-based and T 1 -weighted or relaxivity-enhanced) {{have been}} applied to assess tumor perfusion and its response to therapies. A significant challenge {{in the development of}} reliable biomarkers is a rigorous assessment and optimization of reproducibility. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the measurement reproducibility of T 1 -weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) -MRI and T 2 *-weighted dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) -MRI with two contrast agents (CA) of different molecular weight (MW) : gadopentetate (Gd-DTPA, 0. 5 kDa) and <b>Gadomelitol</b> (P 792, 6. 5 kDa). Each contrast agent was tested with eight mice that had subcutaneous MDA-MB- 231 breast xenograft tumors. Each mouse was imaged with a combined DSC-DCE protocol three times within one week to achieve measures of reproducibility. DSC-MRI results were evaluated with a contrast to noise ratio (CNR) efficiency threshold. There was a clear signal drop (. 95 % probability threshold) in the DSC of normal tissue, while signal changes were minimal or non-existent (, 95 % probability threshold) in tumors. Mean within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) of relative blood volume (rBV) in normal tissue was 11. 78 % for Gd-DTPA and 6. 64 % for P 792. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of rBV in normal tissue was 0. 940 for Gd-DTPA and 0. 978 for P 792. The inter-subject correlation coefficient was 0. 092. Calculated Ktrans from DCE-MRI showed comparable reproducibility (mean wCV, 5. 13 % for Gd-DTPA, 8. 06 % for P 792). ICC of Ktrans showed high intra-subject reproducibility (ICC = 0. 999 / 0. 995) and inter-subject heterogeneity (ICC = 0. 774). Histograms of Ktran...|$|E
