5|$|M1 is flat-crowned. The anteroloph, a crest at {{the front}} of the tooth, lacks a smaller {{accessory}} spur that is present in N.rufus. The paracone, one of the main cusps, is quite small; this cusp is more prominent in N.rufus. The mesoloph, a crest on the middle of the tooth, is distinct but short and located further to the back than in N.rufus. M2 has a longer mesoloph. M3 is largely flat-crowned, but the paracone <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> prominent than the rest. The valley between the cusps {{at the front}} is deeper than the valleys at the back. Each of the upper molars has three roots.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

25|$|As no {{evidence}} indicates passerines were flightless {{when they arrived}} on New Zealand (that apomorphy is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the Mesozoic. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from Australia some 55 Mya, the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the Late Paleocene from Australia or the then-temperate Antarctic coasts. Plate tectonics indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's minimum distance from Australia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> today – some 1,700km/1,100 miles - whereas it is now at least 2,500km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies for a team is their forecheck. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking {{is an important part of}} the dump and chase strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the left wing lock, which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.|$|E

For the year, Bordagaray batted [...]315 with a [...]346OBP and [...]419SLG for the Dodgers, finishing ninth in the NL with 12 steals. He was third among the team's regulars in average, behind Babe Phelps and Joe Stripp. His [...]991 fielding percentage was second among outfielders in the NL, trailing only teammate Johnny Cooney. [...] That season, however, he received a $500 fine and 60-day suspension for spitting at an umpire.

500|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used classification schemata for AML are the older French-American-British (FAB) system and the newer World Health Organization (WHO) system. According to the widely used WHO criteria, the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20% of the blood and/or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts, except in the three best prognosis forms of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities (t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17)) in which {{the presence of the}} genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent. The French–American–British (FAB) classification <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> stringent, requiring a blast percentage of at least 30% in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) for the diagnosis of AML.

500|$|For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders {{for more than ten}} minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 2012 Walker joined Scunthorpe United on a one-month {{emergency}} loan deal.

500|$|Possessing a {{very strong}} will, the {{character}} tends to exhibit outstanding perseverance {{when it comes to}} what she expects out of her relationships, jobs, and life in general, oftentimes refusing to settle for anything less than what satisfies her.

Nick at Nite joked that the character [...] "likes to keep things tidy in her home and love life, although the latter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> difficult."
