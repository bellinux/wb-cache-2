Two days later, he re-signed with the White Sox on a one-year contract for $1.5 million. After left <b>handed</b> <b>starter</b> Carlos Rodon landed on the disabled list, the White Sox called up Turner to take his spot in the rotation.

On December 30, they signed left <b>handed</b> <b>starter</b> Scott Kazmir to a 3-year free agent contract. On January 6, they designated Olson for assignment and re-signed starting pitcher Brandon Beachy to a $1.5 million incentive laden one-year deal. On January 7, they signed right-handed starter Kenta Maeda, {{formerly of the}} Japanese Hiroshima Toyo Carp, to an eight-year contract. On January 19, they signed veteran right handed pitcher Joe Blanton to a one-year, $4 million, contract as a relief pitcher. On February 4, they re-signed second baseman Howie Kendrick to a two-year, $20 million, contract. On February 19, the day spring training started, they signed right handed relief pitcher Louis Coleman to a one-year, $725,000, free agent contract and two days later they finalized their signing of Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra to a six-year, $30 million, contract.|$|R
5000|$|The highest {{score for}} one hand is 29: 555J in <b>hand</b> with the <b>starter</b> 5 {{of the same}} suit as the Jack (8 points for four J-5 combinations, 8 points for four 5-5-5 combinations, 12 points for pairs of 5s and one for his nob).|$|R

5000|$|Late in the First World War Britain’s airship {{aspirations}} {{were boosted}} by the {{order for the}} R36, R37 and R38. All three airships were powered a variety of engines including the [...] Sunbeam Cossack III a derivative of the Cossack with a flywheel, <b>hand</b> or air <b>starter,</b> engine controls and magnetos mounted directly on the engine for access by the engine mechanics. The Cossack 3 was designed with a water-cooled exhaust and speed governor. The overhead camshaft was gear driven from the crankshaft. Only 14 Cossack IIIs were built due to the cancellation of the post-war British airships.|$|R
5000|$|In {{similar fashion}} to other engine {{families}} designed by Coatalen the Cossack spawned a straight-six derivative in the Amazon, in effect half a Cossack, retaining the 110 x 160mm bore/stroke, overhead camshaft, four poppet valves per cylinder and cast-iron cylinder blocks {{in groups of}} three. An output of [...] from 9.2 L for a running weight of 747 lb led to a high power to weight ratio. Despite the high output the Amazon was little used in Britain, with only possible use aboard Coastal airships and some supplied to the Imperial Russian Air Service. Amazon production totalled 77 out of an order for 100, 23 of which were cancelled. A non-aviation use version of the Amazon was produced as the Sunbeam Amazon II, fitted with <b>hand</b> and/or compressed-air <b>starters</b> and single magneto ignition system.|$|R
50|$|Referee: The referee has {{full control}} and {{authority}} over all officials. The referee will enforce all rules and decisions of FINA and shall decide all questions {{relating to the}} actual conduct of the meet, and event or the competition, the final settlement of which is not otherwise covered by the rules. The referee takes overall responsibility for running the race and makes the final decisions as to who wins the competition. Referees call swimmers to the blocks with short blasts {{of his or her}} whistle. This is the signal for the swimmers to stand next to their blocks. Then the referee will blow a long whistle that will tell the swimmers to step on the block. For backstroke events, the long whistle is the signal for the swimmers to step in the water. The referee will then blow another long whistle, signalling the swimmers to grab the gutter or the provided block handle. The referee will then hand over the rest to the starter by directing his or her <b>hand</b> to the <b>starter.</b>|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{management}} practices in no-tillage systems may need adjustment to maximize profits because {{the distribution of}} nutrients and plant roots {{are affected by the}} lack of tillage. This 3 -yr study evaluated (i) no-tillage corn response to surface broadcast and subsurface placement of fertilizer N, P, or K, (ii) no-tillage soybean response to broadcast and banded P or K as well as the direct and residual responses to P and K, and (iii) no-tillage corn hybrids response to complete starter fertilizer;The results suggest that at high soil test levels, response to fertilizers would be difficult to achieve with consistency regardless of placement method. Although P and K stratification existed at each site, favorable moisture and high soil P and K levels probably precluded any grain yield response to added fertilizer or placement in several site-years. Corn and soybean yields were even reduced on a high testing soil. Broadcast applications were equal or better than banded applications. On one occasion, the 36. 2 kg P ha - 1 rate not only raised corn yields in the year of application but had residual effect on soybean yields the following year. Soybean responded to direct P on optimum or very low testing soil. Direct and residual K fertilizers resulted in similar yields. Crop responses to added P or K on high testing no-tillage soils may not always result in large economic advantages for producers in Iowa;On the other <b>hand,</b> a complete <b>starter</b> fertilizer applied in subsurface bands enhanced early plant growth and grain yield of no-tillage corn. Consistent responses were observed {{in a wide range of}} soils, suggesting that corn response to complete starter can be independent of fertility level. Because the hybrids responded similarly to complete starter fertilizer, producers need not manage these hybrids differently with respect to starter fertilizer;Recommended soil-test P and K interpretations for corn and soybean based on conventional tillage are also appropriate for these no-tillage systems. Also, P and K stratification and placement of these nutrients may not be major issues for no-tillage corn and soybean production in Iowa...|$|R
