50|$|In 1950 Erik Erikson {{created the}} term <b>generativity</b> {{to explain the}} Care stage in his theory of the stages of psychosocial development. The Care stage {{encompasses}} the middle ages of one’s life, from 40 through 64. <b>Generativity</b> {{was defined as the}} “ability to transcend personal interests to provide care and concern for younger and older generations.” It took over 30 years for <b>generativity</b> to become a subject of empirical research. Modern psychoanalysts, starting in the early 1990s, have included a concern for one’s legacy, referred to as an “inner desire for immortality”, in the definition of <b>generativity.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that in adult development, intimacy, career consolidation, and <b>generativity</b> are mastered in that particular order {{for both men and}} women. This is explained since in order to love their work (career consolidation), adults first should love their spouses (intimacy). In order to care for others (<b>generativity),</b> adults should first love their work (career consolidation).|$|E
5000|$|More recently, {{the term}} {{has been adopted}} by people who deal with {{technology}}, first used by Johnathan Zittrain in 2006. <b>Generativity</b> in technology is defined as “the ability of a technology platform or technology ecosystem to create, generate or produce new output, structure or behavior without input from the originator of the system.” An example of {{this could be the}} iOS and Android mobile operating systems, for which developers have created millions of unique applications. It has been argued that the open Internet is both an inspiration of <b>generativity</b> and a means to spread the products of <b>generativity.</b> However, some people including Johnathan Zittrain fear that society and technology are moving away from a generative internet, claiming “A shift in consumer priorities from <b>generativity</b> to stability will compel undesirable responses from regulators and markets and, if unaddressed, could prove decisive in closing today’s open computing environments.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of a narrative can also vary depending on <b>generativity</b> (the degree to which an individual wishes to improve society and help future generations) and optimism. For example, in one study, participants narrated personally meaningful events from their pasts; these could be positive, negative turning point, or early childhood memories. Research participants with high <b>generativity</b> and optimism scores tended to have high narrative redemption scores.|$|E
50|$|Psychologically, <b>generativity</b> {{is concern}} for the future, a need to nurture and guide younger people and {{contribute}} to the next generation. Erikson argued that this usually develops during middle age (which spans ages 40 through 64) in keeping with his stage-model of psychosocial development. After having experienced old age himself, Erikson believed that <b>generativity</b> maintains a more important role in later life than he initially had thought.|$|E

McAdam's model is not restricted to stages, with <b>generativity</b> {{able to be a}} concern throughout adulthood, not just in middle adulthood, as Erikson suggested. Example items include [...] "I try to pass along the knowledge that I have gained through my experiences", [...] "I have a responsibility to improve the neighborhood in which I live", and (reversed) [...] "In general, my actions do not {{have a positive effect on}} other people." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Erikson’s theory <b>Generativity</b> is {{contrasted with}} Stagnation. During this stage, people {{contribute}} {{to the next generation}} through caring, teaching, engaging in creative work which contributes to society. <b>Generativity</b> involves answering the question [...] "Can I Make My Life Count?", and in this process, finding your life’s work and contributing to the development of others through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and contributing to future generations. It has also been described as a concern for one's legacy, accepting the independence lives of family and increasing philanthropic pursuits. Generative concern leads to concrete goals and actions such as [...] "providing a narrative schematic of the generative self to the next generation".|$|E

50|$|Middle {{adulthood}} generally {{refers to}} the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between <b>generativity</b> and stagnation.

5000|$|Zittrain {{was first}} to apply this term outside psychology, in cases where a {{generative}} technology leads to [...] "unanticipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences." [...] Zittrain has also highlighted that precarious nature of generative technology: arguing that features which, for instance, may enhance security and stability may, even unintentionally reduce or destroy a <b>generativity</b> in a system. He highlighted cases in which apparently innocuous producer, consumer, and government actions from a move away from PCs to one-way systems such as [...] "smart" [...] appliances cause a decline in <b>generativity.</b> As a result, he emphasised {{the need to be}} clear about treating <b>generativity,</b> rather than apparent means supporting this as the key valued characteristic of the system. In the case of the internet/PC complex this is its capacity as a generative networked grid, rather than traits associated with this, such as [...] "open internet" [...] or “network neutrality”. He termed a focus on these mere-means to the end of <b>generativity</b> a [...] "myopic" [...] "end-to-end theory" [...] which confused means with ends. Zittrain argued:focusing on “network” without regard to a particular network policy’s influence on the design of net- work endpoints such as PCs. As a result of this focus, political advo- cates of end-to-end are too often myopic; many writers seem to pre- sume current PC and OS architecture to be fixed in an “open” position. If they can be persuaded to see a larger picture, they may agree to some compromises at the network level. If complete fidelity to end-to- end network neutrality persists, our PCs may be replaced by informa- tion appliances or may undergo a transformation from open platforms to gated communities to prisons, creating a consumer information en- vironment that betrays the very principles that animate end-to-end theory.

5000|$|The theory {{asserts that}} the process of {{interconnection}} is both orderly and predictable. In a series of studies with animals and people, Epstein showed that <b>Generativity</b> Theory, cast into a series of equations called [...] "transformation functions" [...] and instantiated in a computer model, could be used to predict novel, creative behavior moment-to-moment in time in both animals and people under controlled laboratory conditions. Computer models derived from <b>Generativity</b> Theory generate a series of smooth, overlapping probability curves, each representing a possible behavior that can occur in a new situation, together comprising what Epstein calls a [...] "probability profile". He also developed a new graphical technique called a [...] "frequency profile", which demonstrates the orderliness of actual novel performances. The curves of a frequency profile can be predicted by Epstein's equations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Generativity</b> Theory is a formal, {{predictive}} {{theory of}} creative behavior in individuals.

50|$|<b>Generativity</b> in {{technology}} refers to cases where a technology supports {{the creation of}} novel products. Canonical examples are the PC and the Internet.

5000|$|Career {{consolidation}} is a {{stage of}} adult development which involves [...] "expanding one's personal identity to assume a social identity within the world of work." [...] This stage was developed by George Vaillant in 1977 and added to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, between intimacy vs. isolation and <b>generativity</b> vs. stagnation. This stage covers the ages of 25 to 35. Vaillant contrasts career consolidation with self-absorption.|$|E

For example, engaging in leisure with their grandchildren can enhance feelings of <b>generativity,</b> whereby older adults achieve well-being by leaving a legacy beyond themselves for future generations.|$|E
50|$|In this stage, an {{individual}} wonders {{whether or not}} they want to contribute to the society. In <b>Generativity,</b> the individual would want to set an example for the generations to come, and leave their mark on society. On the other hand, a person who chooses Stagnation would care less for the society and the generations who are coming. People who are in favor of Stagnation are usually self-absorbed and would rather focus on their own well being.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to Hall's work on adult development, Levinson was {{also influenced by}} Erik Erikson, who {{is well known for}} theory on the stages of psychosocial development. Erikson was one of the pioneers in adult development, as his theory included stages for adulthood, while other theories, such as Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, did not extend past adolescence. Erikson's theory has three stages that he found occurring in early, middle, and late adulthood. These stages revolve around intimacy versus isolation, <b>generativity</b> versus stagnation, and ego integrity versus despair.|$|E
5000|$|Aho's {{paintings}} are noted {{for the way}} they simultaneously convey the power and fragility of Nature. In an essay about Aho's painting, Donald Kuspit wrote: [...] "He {{is a master of}} the natural sublime, but he realizes that intensely experienced nature becomes uncannily abstract, with no loss of concreteness. Aho puts the sublime back in nature, suggesting its abstract structure without denying its concrete fullness." [...] He adds, [...] "Aho regenerates abstraction by returning to its roots in the boundless <b>generativity</b> of nature, and with that gives us a fresh aesthetic consciousness of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} of Skinner's book, {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky argued that the <b>generativity</b> of language shows that it cannot simply be learned, {{that there must be}} some innate [...] "language acquisition device". Many have seen this review as a turning point, when cognitivism took the place of behaviorism as the mainstream in psychology. Behavior analysts generally viewed the criticism as somewhat off point, but it is undeniable that psychology turned its attention elsewhere and the review was very influential in helping to produce the rise of cognitive psychology.|$|E
