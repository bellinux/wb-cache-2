He used his income from the store to invest in railroad and mining stock, but mostly to buy land.

[...] In an American context the families who will use a payday loan are disproportionately either of black or Hispanic descent, recent immigrants, and/or under-educated. These individuals are least able to secure normal, lower-interest-rate forms of credit. Since payday lending operations charge higher interest-rates than traditional banks, they {{have the effect of}} depleting the assets of low-income communities.

2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Islamic banking is increasing day by day. On the other hand, some people also criticized this system in some aspect. One {{of the criticism}} is that profit sharing rates of Islamic banks are similar to interest rate of <b>deposit</b> <b>banks.</b> While considering this issue, this study aims to identify the causality relationship between profit sharing rate and interest rate in Turkey. Within this scope, monthly, quarterly, 6 -months and yearly data for the period between 2000 and 2016 was analyzed separately. In addition to this situation, Toda Yamamoto causality analysis {{was used in this}} study so as to achieve this objective. According to the results of the analysis, it was determined that there is a significant causality relationship between these rates. In other words, it was concluded that interest rate of the <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> is the main indicator of the profit share rate of Islamic banks in Turkey. The main reason behind this situation is that indicators in the market affect both <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> and Islamic banks. Therefore, it is inevitable that deposit rates and profit share rates will be similar when <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> and Islamic banks perform in the same market...|$|R

With Lebanon''s high fiscal deficits financed largely by domestic commercial banks that rely on deposit funding, deposit growth is a key variable to assess government financing conditions. At the macro level, we find that domestic factors such as economic activity, prices, and the interest differential between the Lebanese pound and the U. S. dollar are significant in explaining deposit demand, as are external factors such as advanced economy economic and financial conditions and variables proxying the availability of funds from the Gulf. Impulse response functions and variance decomposition analyses underscore {{the relative importance of}} the external variables. At the micro level, we find that in addition, bank-specific variables, such as the perceived riskiness of individual banks, their liquidity buffers, loan exposure, and interest margins, bear a significant influence on the demand for <b>deposits.</b> <b>Bank</b> soundness;Banking sector;Commercial banks;Depositories;Economic models;Financial systems;Liquidity;Profits;deposit growth, <b>banking,</b> <b>bank</b> <b>deposit,</b> <b>banking</b> system, <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> growth, <b>bank</b> <b>deposits,</b> <b>bank</b> assets, net interest margin, income statement, financial market, deposit insurance, stock index, bank interest, financial system, liquidity ratio, international finance, bank profitability, financial stability, financial sector, bank data, financial intermediation, bank interest margins, return on equity, debt restructuring, bank balance sheet, financial institutions, world stock market, banking systems, international country risk guide, stock market, banks ? asset, stock market index, return on assets, financial risk, <b>banks</b> ? balance sheets, <b>deposit</b> rate, financial markets, <b>deposit</b> insurance scheme, <b>bank</b> spreads, equity capital...|$|R

It was an enormous number of scores of lakhs--a miserable remnant of his ancestors' treasures--that sort of thing. And it was all authentic enough.

In de Barral's case, he got put away in my mausoleum in company with so many names of his own creation that really he had to throw off a monstrous heap of grisly bones before he stood before me at the call of the wizard Fyne.

40|$|Based on {{the private}} records of a 16 th century {{prominent}} merchant-bank (Salviati of Lyon), this paper brings to light an important instrument of trade finance in the early modern age: the fair deposit. While financial history of <b>deposit</b> <b>banking</b> has often been separated from that of merchant-banking, this paper demonstrates that in the 16 th century, {{a specific type of}} <b>deposit</b> <b>banking</b> emerged on the fair locations, intrinsically connected to merchant-banking and international trade. The fair deposit, revealed by analysis of the Salviati books, appears to be both a clearing and credit instrument, sustaining the financing of European big business. Credit mostly derived from international trade and banking, where it was re-injected forthwith. Investments were stimulated by the numerous advantages offered by the Lyon fairs - i. e. licit lending at interest, alternatives for investments, possibilities of purchases and rapid transfers. Loans to local and foreign businessmen nourished the trade of commodities and, above all, the exchange business, conferring on Lyon a crucial position in European trade and exchange system. Such form of <b>deposit</b> <b>banking</b> was closely related to the development of merchant banks working mostly on commission, which drew substantial profits from it without specializing in it or ever becoming <b>deposit</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the relationship between}} CAMELS ratios and credit ratings of <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> in Turkey. Annual data {{was used for the}} period between 2004 and 2014 in this study. Moreover, 20 <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> of Turkey were analyzed and 21 different ratios of CAMELS components were used. In addition to that, credit ratings of these banks were provided from Moody’s corporation or annual activity reports of the banks. After that, we created multi nominal logistic regression analysis in order to illustrate the relationship. The major finding in this study is that three components (Asset Quality, Management Quality, and Sensitivity to Market Risk) of CAMELS have effects on credit ratings whereas the ratios related to Capital Adequacy and Earnings are not effective. As a result, it was recommended that Turkish <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> should concentrate on the percentage of fixed assets and interest income to have a better rating. Moreover, having high market share with respect to total assets and lower interest expense are also other important points for this purpose. On the other hand, Turkish <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> should control the proportion of financial assets and increase the amount of FX liquid assets to prevent credit ratings to decrease. Additionally, market share of banks for loans should not reach at high level for this objective. </p...|$|R
