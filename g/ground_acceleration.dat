5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> could be made.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E
25|$|The JMA Scale {{runs from}} 0 to 7, with 7 being the strongest. The Mercalli {{intensity}} scale is sometimes used {{together with the}} Shindo; however this is not usual practice in Japan.

25|$|Between 2005 and 2007, three Japanese {{nuclear power}} plants were shaken by {{earthquakes}} that far exceeded the maximum peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> used in their design.

25|$|Unit 1 was {{designed}} for a peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> of 0.18g (1.74m/s2) and a response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake, but rated for 0.498 g. The design basis for Units 3 and 6 were 0.45 g (4.41m/s2) and 0.46 g (4.48m/s2) respectively. All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> was 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30 seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered. The design basis for tsunamis was 5.7 meters.|$|E
25|$|Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) {{calculated}} a peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> of 2.99g (29.33m/s2).

40|$|The 2010 - 2011 Canterbury {{earthquake}} sequence {{was extremely}} damaging to structures in Christchurch {{and continues to}} have a large economic and social impact on the city and surrounding regions. In addition to strong ground shaking (Bradley and Cubrinovski 2011 SRL; Bradley 2012 SDEE), extensive liquefaction was observed, particularly in the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake (Cubrinovski et al. 2010 BNZSEE; 2011 SRL). Large observed vertical ground motion amplitudes were recorded in the events in this sequence, with vertical peak <b>ground</b> <b>accelerations</b> of over 2. 2 g being observed at the Heathcote Valley Primary School during the Christchurch earthquake, and numerous other vertical motions exceeding 1. 0 g (Bradley and Cubrinovski 2011 SRL; Bradley 2012 SDEE; Fry et al 2011 SRL).

25|$|Shaking {{and ground}} rupture {{are the main}} effects created by earthquakes, principally {{resulting}} in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, {{the distance from the}} epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.

25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant {{consisted}} of six GE light water boiling water reactors (BWRs) {{with a combined}} power of 4.7 gigawatts, {{making it one of}} the world's 25 largest nuclear power stations. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 MWe type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971. It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> of 0.18 g (1.74m/s2) and a response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42g (4.12m/s2) to 0.46g (4.52m/s2). After the 1978 Miyagi earthquake, when the <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> reached 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found. Units 1–5 have a Mark-1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure. In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by mixed-oxides (MOX).|$|E
25|$|Few {{strong motion}} {{seismometer}} installations were present {{outside of the}} western United States prior to the San Fernando earthquake but, upon a recommendation by the Earthquake and Wind Forces Committee, the Veterans Administration entered into {{an agreement with the}} Seismological Field Service (then associated with NOAA) to install the instruments at all VA sites in Uniform Building Code zones two and three. It had been established that these zones had a higher likelihood of experiencing strong <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and the plan was made to furnish the selected VA hospitals with two instruments. One unit would be installed within the structure and the second would be set up as a free-field unit located a short distance away from the facility. As of 1973, a few of the highest risk (26 were completed in zone 3 alone) sites that had been completed were in Seattle, Memphis, Charleston, and Boston.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA field {{measurement}} of ground vibration {{was performed on}} the Beijing−Shanghai high-speed railway in China. In this paper, the experimental results of vertical <b>ground</b> vibration <b>accelerations</b> induced by very high speed trains running over a non-ballasted track on embankment with speeds from 300 to 410 km/h are reported and analyzed in detail for the first time. Characteristics of <b>ground</b> vibration <b>accelerations</b> in both time and frequency domains are analyzed based on the test data. It is shown that the periodic exciting action of high-speed train bogies can be identified in time histories of vertical <b>accelerations</b> of the <b>ground</b> within the range of 50 m from the track centerline. The first dominant sensitive frequency of the <b>ground</b> vibration <b>acceleration</b> results from the wheelbase of the bogie, and the center distance of two neighboring cars {{plays an important role in}} the significant frequencies of the <b>ground</b> vibration <b>acceleration.</b> Variations of time–response peak value and frequency-weighted vertical <b>acceleration</b> level of <b>ground</b> vibration in relation with train speed as well as the distance from the track centerline are also investigated. Results show that the time-domain peak value of <b>ground</b> vibration <b>acceleration</b> exhibits an approximately linear upward tendency with the increase of train speed. With the increasing distance from the track centerline, the frequency-weighted vertical acceleration level of the ground vibration attenuates more slowly than the time-domain peak value of the <b>ground</b> vibration <b>acceleration</b> does. Severe impact of high-speed railway ground vibration on human body comfort on the ground occurs at the speed of 380 – 400 km/h. The results given in the paper are also valuable for validating the numerical prediction of train induced ground vibrations...|$|R

Future research for the integration of hazards with anthropogenic origin and/or conflict situations—another important driver of IDPs at the global level—is needed.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{smaller in}} {{magnitude}} than the 2010 earthquake, the February earthquake was more damaging and deadly {{for a number}} of reasons. The epicentre was closer to Christchurch, and shallower at [...] underground, whereas the September quake was measured at [...] deep. The February earthquake occurred during lunchtime on a weekday when the CBD was busy, and many buildings were already weakened from the previous quakes. The peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> (PGA) was extremely high, and simultaneous vertical and horizontal ground movement was [...] "almost impossible" [...] for buildings to survive intact. Liquefaction was significantly greater than that of the 2010 quake, causing the upwelling of more than 200,000 tonnes of silt which needed to be cleared. The increased liquefaction caused significant ground movement, undermining many foundations and destroying infrastructure, damage which [...] "may be the greatest ever recorded anywhere in a modern city". 80% of the water and sewerage system was severely damaged.|$|E
2500|$|The main quake {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of strike-slip faulting within the crust of the Pacific plate, near the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps at {{the western edge of the}} Canterbury Plains. The earthquake epicentre is located about [...] to the south and east of the current surface expression of the Australia–Pacific plate boundary through the island (the Alpine and Hope Faults). Though removed from the plate boundary itself, the earthquake likely reflects right-lateral motion on one of a number of regional faults related to the overall relative motion of these plates and may be related to the overall southern propagation of the Marlborough Fault System in recent geologic time. The peak <b>ground</b> <b>acceleration</b> measured near Darfield was 1.26g (12.36m/s2), recorded near Darfield.
