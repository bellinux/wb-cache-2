The characterization of the grinding balls are conducted by visual observation, chemical composition test, hardness test, and metallographyc test. Visual observation shows that the imported <b>grinding</b> <b>ball</b> appear to have a rough surfaces, both sleced are whitish and there are small cracks on all specimens. Chemical composition test shows that that the imported ball mill ( 40 mm) contain 2, 08 % C and 11, 608 % Cr, while the ( 60 mm) one contain 2, 08 % C, 16, 58 % Cr. Both specimen are martensitic white cast iron ASTM A 532 Class II Type A and B. Hardnes test shows that the outer part of the <b>grinding</b> <b>ball</b> have higher hardness then the inner one with the value of 781, 9 kg/mm 2 ( 40 mm) and 975, 4 kg/mm 2 ( 60 mm). The lowest hardness value are 542 kg/mm 2 ( 40 mm) and 561 kg/mm 2 ( 60 mm). Moreover, the metallographyc test shows that both materials have perlite, cementite and martensite sructure.

The {{aim of this}} investigation was to prepare CLA nanoparticles from a ternary ground mixture in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as co-grinding water-soluble compounds, in order to improve the drug dissolution rate.

40|$|The {{grinding}} {{efficiency of}} semi autogenous milling or ball milling {{depends on the}} tumbling motion of the total charge within the mill. Utilization of this tumbling motion for efficient breakage of particles depends on the conditions inside the mill. However, any kind of monitoring device to measure the conditions inside the mill shell during operation is virtually impossible due to the severe environment presented by the tumbling charge. An instrumented <b>grinding</b> <b>ball,</b> which {{is capable of surviving}} a few hours and transmitting the impacts it experiences, is proposed here. The spectrum of impacts collected over 100 revolutions of the mills presents the signature of the grinding environment inside mill.

40|$|The {{size and}} {{distribution}} of particles are particle characteristics which are among other things significantly important for processing charateristics of raw materials and biopharmaceutical properties of produced drugs. Shredding means decreasing the size of particles using mechanic forces, like cutting, crushing, mincing, chopping, milling or grinding.

The <b>grinding</b> <b>balls</b> are then represented by DEM particles and the mill structure is considered rigid. To include more physical phenomena several numerical methods can be combined. One important improvement is to include the mill structure response, using the finite element method (FEM). The interaction between charge and lining can then be studied in detail. The pulp can also be included using a particle-based continuum method e. g. smoothed particle method (SPH). The strength of SPH lies in modelling of free surface flows and very large deformations and {{it is suited to}} model simultaneous fluid and granular flow. Still, the coarse particles (<b>grinding</b> <b>balls)</b> in the charge are suitable to be model using DEM. Each of these methods has their strength and weaknesses, but combined they can successfully mimic the main features of the charge movement.
