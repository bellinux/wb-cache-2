25|$|After {{the grants}} from the king, Richard's Devon estates {{probably}} consisted of around 180 Domesday manors, including Tiverton and Honiton, {{as well as the}} boroughs of Exeter and Plympton. The honour of Christchurch consisted of many widely scattered manors in several counties. He held virtually all of the Isle of Wight (the exceptions being two manors held by the bishop of Winchester), and the island remained in his family until King Edward <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from a dying Isabella de Fortibus in 1293.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

60|$|I {{thought he}} needn't {{have asked me}} if I had my ticket when he knew that <b>I</b> had <b>bought</b> <b>it.</b> But perhaps he thought I had lost it by this time. He was a very {{particular}} little man.|$|R

2500|$|During {{his early}} career, Ó Domhnaill played a dark journeyman's Guild {{dreadnought}} guitar {{on stage and}} on recordings. In 1977, he commissioned a custom-made guitar from luthier Kenny White who was based out of Portland, Oregon. During the 1990s, he played a 1975 Martin D-28, which he used on his later recordings and stage appearances. In a 1996 interview, Ó Domhnaill observed, [...] "It's gotten louder, fuller, clearer, and more bell-like. It wasn't a great instrument when <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it,</b> {{but it was a}} Martin, and I knew it would improve if I played it. I have, and it's worked." [...] Ó Domhnaill also owned a custom-made guitar by another Portland luthier Terry Demezas. He preferred medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings, and used a large triangular Fender medium flatpick when not fingerpicking. For much of his career, he performed with a small quiver of tin whistles and a pedal harmonium.|$|E

60|$|I {{slipped away}} at this point, {{suddenly}} remembering {{that it was}} time to take a dose of magic seed. <b>I</b> had <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from Billy Robinson three days before in school. Billy had assured me that it would make me grow fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true. I was waiter in a New York {{restaurant}} for five years. Then I retired. I {{came back to}} Belgium. I married my wife. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> land. <b>It</b> is near Ghent. I am, as you have guessed, a person of great importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't I a good brother, now, {{to buy you}} a line all to yourself? You know, <b>I</b> needn't have <b>bought</b> <b>it,</b> if <b>I</b> hadn't liked." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Father cut {{a hole in}} one of the oranges that I {{sent down}} to mother, and then she {{squeezed}} the juice of it out into her mouth.

6000|$|... "By George! {{that will}} be a capital idea--yes, the {{handkerchief}} must be sent back to-morrow morning; THAT will make a famous talk. <b>I</b> only <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> because Munny was present, and I wanted to get fifty thousand dollars out of him, to meet this crisis. The thing didn't succeed; but, no matter, the handkerchief will tell in settling up. That handkerchief, Dosie, may be made to cover a hundred lots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} have it," [...] Mr. Sabin answered. [...] "You can take that for granted. You shall not {{take it from me}} by force, and I will see that you do not charm it out of my pocket by other means.

6000|$|... "But first, let us eat. I see {{you look}} {{surprised}} but, although the store we brought hither is long since exhausted, {{there is still}} a last reserve. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it,</b> with all the money that I had with me, from one of Simon's men, upon the day when we came hither from the lower town. He had gained it, doubtless, in wanton robbery for, at that time, the fighting men had plenty of food; but as it was his, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it,</b> thinking that the time might come when one meal might mean life to many of us. I have never touched it, but it remains where I hid it, in my chamber. I will fetch it, now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... '3. Mansoul is mine {{by right}} of purchase. <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> <b>it,</b> O Diabolus, <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> to myself. Now, {{since it was}} my Father's and mine, as I was his heir, and since also I have made it mine by virtue of a great purchase, it followeth that, by all lawful right, the town of Mansoul is mine, and that thou art an usurper, a tyrant, and traitor, in thy holding {{possession}} thereof. Now, the cause of my purchasing of it was this: Mansoul had trespassed against my Father; now my Father had said, that in the day that they broke his law they should die. Now, it is more possible for heaven and earth to pass away than for my Father to break his word. Wherefore when Mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thy lie, I put in and became a surety to my Father, body for body, and soul for soul, that I would make amends for Mansoul's transgressions, and my Father did accept thereof. So, when the time appointed was come, I gave body for body, soul for soul, life for life, blood for blood, and so redeemed my beloved Mansoul.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, <b>I</b> just <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> Workshop {{back and}} relaunched Habitat company {{a couple months}} ago and plan on relaunching Alien in the near future. Alien takes a {{different}} strategy because the guys I've done Alien with I've known my entire life, and they wanted {{a little bit of}} a transition. Basically, we've restructured both companies and we have the right setup now where they will run real lean, and that's the way they need to be for the modern market. They'll be around for another 50 years.|$|R

6000|$|... "O Prince, {{the most}} high Satrap is mistaken. The King of kings {{did not give}} me the cup, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> from him in {{exchange}} for a certain famous bow, and therefore held it not wrong to pass it on to you, my lord." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, the dog {{was mine}} once, at all events--though I doubt not it is {{rightfully}} yours now," [...] said the young lady, {{with a smile that}} at once disarmed me.

6000|$|Perhaps you {{remember}} that celebrated [...] "North Ophir?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> that mine. <b>It</b> was very rich in pure silver.
