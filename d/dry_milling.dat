40|$|York Timbers Pty Ltd is a South African timber {{processing}} {{company that has}} four saw mills in the Mpumalanga province. York Timbers manufacture high quality timber products for local and international markets. All four saw mills are controlled and monitored by their head office in Sabie, Mpumalanga. Recently {{it has been observed}} that the Driekop <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> in Graskop cannot fulfil all the orders that are received resulting from limited or no availability of products. Each saw mill has among other areas, a <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> and rework area. There are several employees working at each of the processes that occur in the <b>dry</b> <b>mill.</b> There is a constant flow of products through the <b>dry</b> <b>mill.</b> The Driekop mill experiences difficulties with operations in their <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> such as ineffective storage of work-in-progress and finished products and poor control over inventory. This is due to the absence of a fixed storage plan for work-in-progress and finished products. These problems are inhibiting optimum product flow and affect the functionality {{of the rest of the}} plant. There is urgent need for improved product flow through the <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> as well as a storage plan to improve inventory control. A new layout will be developed for the <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> area using Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) to better locate and access stacks. Industrial Engineering best practices for inventory management will assist in developing the storage plan and lean manufacturing techniques will be used to help eliminate the types of waste present. Overall improved product flow through the <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> and rework area will be achieved to increase the daily number of products produced. Thesis (B Eng.

30|$|We {{prepared}} pure ZnO and {{a mixture}} of ZnO and V 2 O 5 NPs by mechanical milling in different conditions: <b>dry</b> and ethanol-assisted <b>milling.</b> From Raman spectra of the pure ZnO <b>dry</b> <b>milled</b> sample, the increase of the signal of the A 1 (LO) mode, related to structural defects such as Zni, supports {{the fact that this}} defect is the source of magnetic moment as the sample has higher magnetization than that of commercial ZnO. On the other hand, <b>dry</b> <b>milled</b> samples exhibit a reduction of magnetization; even if milling increases the concentration of Zni, the exposure of the powders to oxygen from air during milling reduces the amount of VO, which mediates ferromagnetic order between Zni. The coupling between Zni through VO corresponds to the BMP’ model.|$|R

40|$|Estimates {{suggest that}} capital costs {{typically}} increase less than proportionately with plant {{capacity in the}} <b>dry</b> <b>mill</b> ethanol industry because the estimated power factor is 0. 836.

Some estimates also suggest a phase of decreasing unit costs followed by a phase of increasing costs. Nonetheless <b>dry</b> <b>mills</b> could be somewhat larger than the current industry standard, unless other scarce factors limit capacity expansion.
