5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome,</b> MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{transcript}} {{levels of}} nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were quantified in human myoblasts and myotubes cultured from biopsies of patients harboring either heteroplasmic point mutation or deletion of mitochondrial DNA. The transcript patterns {{were determined by}} two different methodologies, competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and classical Northern blot analysis, both referred to the mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio. In myoblasts from the patients with MELAS (myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) and KSS (<b>Kearns-Sayre)</b> <b>syndromes,</b> both methodologies revealed an increase of mtDNA transcript levels. A higher level of the nuclear ATP synthase beta transcript was observed in the MELAS patient cells and could be the consequence of a feedback effect of the mitochondrial DNA mutation. Moreover, the nuclear and mitochondrial transcript accumulation is more pronounced after myoblast differentiation. Thus, the OXPHOS expression is specifically altered in patients with mitochondrial diseases.

40|$|DNA end-joining was {{measured}} by incubating linearized plasmid DNA with mitochondrial protein extracts. A spectrum of end-joined molecules ranging from re-circularized monomer to dimer and higher molecular weight forms was observed. The DNA end-joining reaction required ATP and Mg 2 +, and was inhibited by sodium chloride. Both cohesive- and blunt-ended DNA molecules were end-joined, although the former were more efficient substrates. Molecular analysis of rejoined molecules revealed that > 95 % of the linearized DNA were precisely end-joined. The few imprecisely end-joined molecules recovered, sustained deletions that spanned direct repeat sequences. The deletions observed are strikingly similar to those present in mitochondrial genomes of patients with <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> or Pearson <b>syndromes,</b> certain ophthalmic myopathies and the aged. These results suggest that mammalian mitochondria possess a DNA double strand break repair activity similar to that seen in the nucleus, and that this repair pathway {{may play a role}} in the generation of mitochondrial DNA deletions associated with a number of human pathologies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Sensorineural hearing {{impairment}} (SNHI) is a well-recognized manifestation of mitochondrial diseases and occurs {{either in a}} non-syndromic form or {{as a part of}} a syndrome. Mitochondrial deafness is bilateral, usually progressive and is inherited maternally. Approximately 70 % of patients with the most common <b>syndromes,</b> <b>Kearns-Sayre,</b> MELAS or MERRF, have SNHI. Several mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found to cause non-syndromic SNHI, including 1555 A>G, 7445 T>C, 7472 insC and 7511 T>C. In order to estimate prevalences of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in population-based cohorts of patients with SNHI, we obtained samples from 133 patients with SNHI, reportedly representing 117 separate maternal lineages. We found five patients with the 3243 A>G mutation and three with the 1555 A>G mutation, whereas the other point mutations associated with SNHI were absent. The frequencies of the mutations in the cohort were thus 4. 3 % for 3243 A>G and 2. 6 % for 1555 A>G, suggesting a total frequency of 6. 9 % for mtDNA mutations known to be associated with {{hearing impairment}}. We found a mutation 10044 A>G, which has been reported as pathogenic, in our patients with SNHI, but we also found it among the controls. Our results show it to be a homoplasmic polymorphism associated with a fairly rare haplotype within mtDNA haplogroup H which has recently been confirmed as subcluster H 4. These results highlight the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of a mtDNA mutation when it is identified only in one family. Therefore, in addition to the previously published criteria, we suggest that a sufficient number of haplotype-specific controls should be screened before the pathogenic nature of a mtDNA mutation can be verified. We determined the complete mtDNA sequences for 121 Finns, and after complementing our recent data, for a total of 192 Finns, and were able to construct a phylogenetic network based on complete mtDNA sequences, the largest set of complete sequences available at that time. These mtDNAs provide a rich source of information for studies in population genetics and a potential tool for analysing new substitutions and genotypes that entail a risk of mitochondrial disease. We used the phylogenetic network to find new pathogenic mutations or risk genotypes for SNHI. The entire coding region sequences of mtDNA were determined in 32 patients with SNHI and compared with the network. The patients were found to harbour more rare polymorphisms and haplotypes than the controls and to show increased variation in their mtDNA sequences, suggesting mildly deleterious effects for these substitutions. Two of the new mutations were suggested as putatively pathogenic...|$|R

50|$|<b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> (KSS) is a {{mitochondrial}} myopathy with a typical onset before 20 years of age. KSS {{is a more}} severe syndromic variant of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (abbreviated CPEO), a syndrome that is characterized by isolated involvement of the muscles controlling movement of the eyelid (levator palpebrae, orbicularis oculi) and eye (extra-ocular muscles). This results in ptosis and ophthalmoplegia respectively. KSS involves {{a combination of the}} already described CPEO as well as pigmentary retinopathy in both eyes and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Other symptoms may include cerebellar ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, deafness, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other endocrinopathies. In both of these diseases, muscle involvement may begin unilaterally but always develops into a bilateral deficit, and the course is progressive.

40|$|Objective <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{mitochondrial}} myopathy, {{which was}} first described by Tomas Kearn in 1958.

The nature of this uncommon disease is yet to be clarified.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{mitochondrial}} myopathy that demonstrates chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia with onset {{before the age}} of 20 and pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Case presentation We report the case of an 18 -year-old Romanian man with short stature, external ophthalmoplegia, palpebral ptosis, myopathy, sensorineural hearing impairment, cerebellar ataxia, cardiac conduction defect, diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism and hyperaldosteronism. The patient's evolution showed progressive insufficiency of the renal tubule: hyperphosphaturia, hyperaminoaciduria and, later, glucosuria (de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome), a syndrome, to date, rarely diagnosed in association with complete <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The final diagnosis was delayed for several years and was only established when he developed diabetes mellitus. Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction amplification revealed the presence of a deletion in the mitochondrial DNA. Conclusion Despite the rarity of this syndrome, the diagnosis was easily made due to the presence of the classic triad: external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy and onset in a patient younger than 20 years old. In our opinion, a search for <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> in all patients with de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome is a valuable medical routine. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{mitochondrial}} disorder (generally due to mitochondrial DNA deletions) {{that causes}} ophthalmoplegia, retinopathy, ataxia and brain abnormalities such as leukoencephalopathy. In this syndrome, the choroid plexus epithelial cells, unlike brain cells, are greatly enlarged and granular, {{consistent with their}} inability to adequately transport folate from blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and homovanillic acid (a dopamine metabolite) from CSF into blood. This inability to transport folates from blood into CSF (and brain) adequately, causes cerebral folate deficiency that can be partially reversed by very high doses of reduced folates. The <b>Kearns-Sayre</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a disease that interferes with key choroid plexus functions and is a cause of generalized choroid plexus failure. </p...|$|E
