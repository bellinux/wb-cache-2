25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> and lobotomies {{are viewed}} as being almost as barbaric as the Bedlam [...] "treatments", {{although}} the <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> was still seen as the only option which produced any noticeable effect on patients. ECT is still used in the West, but {{it is seen as}} a last resort for treatment of mood disorders, and is administered much more safely than in the past. Elsewhere, particularly in India, use of ECT is reportedly increasing, as a cost-effective alternative to drug treatment. The effect of a shock on an overly excitable patient often allowed these patients to be discharged to their homes, which was seen by administrators (and often guardians) as a preferable solution to institutionalisation. Lobotomies were performed in the hundreds from the 1930s to the 1950s, and were ultimately replaced with modern psychotropic drugs.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Malariotherapy was a {{treatment}} to cure neurosyphilis developed in 1917 by Wagner-Jauregg, by inoculating blood infected with malaria {{in patients with}} neurosyphilis. The patient had febrile episodes that often cured him of the syphilitic infection. This treatment won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927 and it was introduced in Hospital Psiquiátrico São Pedro (HPSP) in 1929. Methods: This is a descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study with collection of historical secondary data. Data were collected from a sample of 19 medical records of patients treated with malariotherapy in HPSP, in 1929 and 1930. Results: Most patients were white men aged from 25 to 40 years. The mean length of hospital stay was 1. 4 year and the outcomes at this early application of malariotherapy were mostly negative (63. 2 % died). Discussion: The 19 cases evaluated in this study refer to {{the first year of}} application of malariotherapy in HPSP. The statistics available on the total number of dead and cured people over the 10 years this therapy was deployed suggest that the outcomes were better in the subsequent years, possibly due to improvement of technique. As a consequence of this innovative research, which had as its principle reorganizing the central nervous system by using the seizure triggered by malaria fever, other forms of <b>shock</b> <b>therapies</b> were developed, such as <b>insulin</b> <b>therapy,</b> cardiazol <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> and electroconvulsive therapy...|$|R
50|$|But {{after leaving}} Hollywood for New York City and {{appearing}} in the Group Theatre play, Golden Boy, Frances learns, much to her chagrin, that the Group Theatre exploited her fame only to draw in more customers, replacing her with a wealthy actress for her family's needed financial backing for the play's London tour, and Odets ends their affair upon his wife's (Luise Rainer) upcoming return from Europe. Her desperate attempts to restart her film career upon returning to Hollywood results in being cast in unchallenging roles in forgettable B-films. Her increased dependence on alcohol and amphetamines in the 1940s and the pressures brought on her by her wannabe mother, who becomes her legal guardian after her multiple legal problems, result in a complete nervous breakdown. After her first hospitalization at Kimball Sanitarium in La Crescenta, she tells her mother that she doesn't {{want to return to}} Hollywood but instead wants to live alone in the countryside, assaulting and threatening her in the resulting argument. While institutionalized at Western State Hospital, Frances is abused by the powers-that-be: she is forced to undergo <b>insulin</b> and electroconvulsive <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> is cruelly beaten, periodically raped by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily lobotomized before her release in 1950.|$|R

2500|$|Early 20th century {{treatments}} for severe and persisting psychosis {{were characterized by}} an emphasis on shocking the nervous system. [...] Such therapies include <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> cardiazol [...] shock therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the number of}} {{patients}} residing in mental hospitals increased significantly while {{little in the way of}} effective medical treatment was available.

The new [...] "heroic" [...] physical therapies devised during this experimental era, including malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (1917), deep sleep therapy (1920), <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938), helped to imbue the then therapeutically moribund and demoralised psychiatric profession with a renewed sense of optimism in the curability of insanity and the potency of their craft. The success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risk they posed to patients, also helped to accommodate psychiatrists to ever more drastic forms of medical intervention, including lobotomy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} {{economic}} regime {{of a country}} influences the efficacy of <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> reform, and if so, how. In this thesis, an economic regime is restricted to be either a mixed or socialist economy, and <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> is defined to be a class of rapid economic reforms used to introduce capitalism to a country. Based on existing literature {{on the subject of}} <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> several variables are identified as having the potential to impact how successful <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> could be given a country’s prevailing economic regime. To ensure that this thesis does not overlook key features that distinguish a mixed economy from a socialist economy, variables are also drawn from two published “freedom indices, ” following the statistical variable reduction procedure of Principal Component Analysis. This thesis first builds a structural model of equations from these variables, and then tests it using regression analysis. Based on isolated statistically significant results (p = 10 %), this thesis concludes that the economic regime influences the efficacy of <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> reform, as measured through nominal – not real – terms, and does so mainly through the following variables: Enterprise Reform, Institutional Framework, and Fiscal Burden. Results suggest, however, that <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> is not more appropriate in mixed economies, disconfirming the hypothesis established at the onset of this research. This research ultimately contributes to the study of <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> with its unique model; its isolated statistically significant results; its novel method of analyzing data dating to the time of reform for each country, as opposed to using cross-sectional data; its inclusion of countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America in the sample space, as opposed to using only one region; and its focus on determining the appropriateness of <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> given a particular economic regime, as opposed to posing the more generic {{question of whether or not}} <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> works...|$|R
