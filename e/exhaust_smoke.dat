40|$|AbstractIn {{high-rise}} building fire, smoke {{is the main}} cause of fire spreading and casualties. As a necessary evacuation route, it's very important for both evacuation and firefighting to ensure the effectiveness of <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> in corridor.

Results show that installation height of the mechanical <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> port has some influence on smoke layer temperature and visibility. With the lower of the installation height of mechanical <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> port, <b>smoke</b> layer temperature at 1. 5 m height of corridor rises gradually, and visibility reduces gradually.

40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of smoke vent height and exhausting velocity on mechanical <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> efficiency. Results {{have shown that the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> process becomes more efficient due to the increased smoke vent height and the decreased exhausting velocity, which eliminate the plug-holing issue with fewer disturbances on the smoke layer interface. For each certain exhausting velocity, there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the <b>smoke</b> <b>exhausting</b> is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the <b>exhausted</b> <b>smoke</b> increased relatively slowly as the distance increases.

For tall atria having difficulties to allocate space for air ductwork and fans of a dynamic <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> system, a <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> system with a ceiling vent is provided. The performance of the system should be evaluated and a two-layer zone model has been designed for such propose. The smoke layer temperature and interface height for a static <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> system in a tall space will be predicted. Based on the empirical formula derived from the entrainment rate of an axisymmetric plume and flow rate at a vent, a simplified calculation procedure of a static <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> in an atrium fire is proposed. Experiments were carried out at a full-scale burning facility of 27 m high, the USTC/PolyU Atrium, for verifying the results.

Therefore, the procedure is recommended to the authority as a tool in evaluating the performance of static <b>smoke</b> <b>exhaust</b> systems.
