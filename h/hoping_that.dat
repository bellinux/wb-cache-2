He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> his spirit and those of his ancestors can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E

5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards.

5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> someone would see them.
