5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E
5|$|Angelina was {{introduced}} as Angelo's daughter {{who had a}} {{dream of becoming a}} successful recording artist. Angelo's girlfriend Gloria requested that music producer Devon should help her out, only for everyone to find out she had no talent. Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, who was already engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe <b>hate</b> <b>her.</b> Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if staring into Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they needed to leave town immediately. Kevin ran away with her after shots were fired during the wedding ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> once again.|$|E

When he was with <b>her,</b> he <b>hated</b> <b>her</b> for having got him, and yet not got him, and he tortured her. She took all and gave nothing, he said. At least, she gave no living warmth. She was never alive, and giving off life. Looking for her was like looking for something which did not exist. She was only his conscience, not his mate. He <b>hated</b> <b>her</b> violently, and was more cruel to her. They dragged on till the next summer. He saw more and more of Clara.|$|R

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> voluntary system—our Tories <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> democrats—our Whigs <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> parvenus—our Radicals <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E
500|$|While Yellowcard {{was working}} on their {{upcoming}} album, Lights and Sounds, they developed a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at times you love her and at times you <b>hate</b> <b>her.</b> At times she's good to you and sometimes she's bad." [...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes you love her and sometimes you <b>hate</b> <b>her,</b> and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through." [...] Key revealed that the song [...] "Rough Landing, Holly", which features the Holly character, was his [...] "favorite song" [...] from Lights and Sounds.|$|E

Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can’t <b>hate</b> <b>her.</b> Because it's so incredibly human and understandable." [...] Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale.|$|E
500|$|This {{promotion}} saw Robbins {{become the}} only lesbian series regular on primetime TV. Robbins {{is described as}} [...] "quirky [...] perky" [...] by TV Guide Matt Mitovich, and [...] "a clear and rational surgeon who is not ruled by her emotions" [...] by Kris De Leon of BuddyTV. William Harper, writer of the episode [...] "Beat Your Heart Out" [...] in which Robbins and Torres kiss for the first time, has deemed Robbins: [...] "genuinely, positively interested in people, in the most selfless way." [...] Commenting on Robbins' confidence, Capshaw commented: [...] "she never thinks she's wrong and you don't <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> for it. There's no ego though, she just always thinks she's right and she is." [...] She is portrayed as having [...] "wacky tendencies", including wearing roller shoes to work.|$|E
500|$|Overall, while fan {{reaction}} to her character had previously {{resulted in a}} backlash Gilsig found [...] "tough", she hoped that [...] "Mattress" [...] would be the episode in which [...] "anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri". Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as you love to <b>hate</b> <b>her,</b> that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun about it is that she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel's (Lea Michele) second {{attempt at}} an {{original}} song, [...] "Only Child", {{proves to be}} only a small improvement over [...] "My Headband". Finn (Cory Monteith) encourages her to dig deeper into her pain to find her song. Quinn's (Dianna Agron) desire to become prom queen prompts her to get close to Rachel in order to run interference between her and Finn. In doing this, she supports Rachel's idea of writing original songs for Regionals; the members of New Directions eventually agree, due to the fact they received a cease and desist letter from My Chemical Romance saying they can't perform [...] "Sing" [...] for Regionals. Sue later admits to forging the letter in yet another attempt to sabotage the glee club. Rachel confronts Quinn about her relationship with Finn, trusting her to be honest. Quinn admits they have been together {{for a couple of weeks}} and tells Rachel that she doesn't belong in Lima. Quinn says she will remain behind with Finn and Rachel can't <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> for helping to send her on her way. Hurt, Rachel goes home and uses Quinn's words as a springboard for writing a new song.|$|E
500|$|... "Iconic" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times {{noted that the}} song is driving by [...] "focus", which puts it [...] "into that sweet spot between club frenzy and revelatory lyricism, the kind that can lift spirits to emotional heights." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{described it as a}} song that [...] "reflect a contemporary trend for fast, furious and funny mash ups of conflicting ideas, constantly teetering on the edge of collapse but pulling out another beat or hook to keep things moving." [...] In a similar mode, Kyler Anderson of Entertainment Weekly confessed that he thought the song would be his [...] "most-skipped track," [...] but admitted that he [...] "kind of admire its barely-conscious chaos." [...] James Grebey of Spin dismissed Tyson's inclusion, however he praised the song for having a statement that is the album's lynchpin and that [...] "ith its robotic, authoritarian droning, 'Iconic' conveys the point that — love her or <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> — Madonna is an icon, and you’re not getting rid of her anytime soon." [...] John Marrs of Gay Times gave the track four out of five stars, claiming that [...] "the finished product is wholly different from the demo and much more gutsy, getting better with every play." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy defined it as [...] "a club-ready dash of trap-pop" [...] and selected the song as one of the [...] "tracks to download". Nick Levine of Time Out agreed, writing that [...] "the sassy stuff is excellent, especially the catchy, trap-tinged 'Iconic'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or <b>hate</b> <b>her,</b> there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E

500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{just written}} the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was {{determined}} to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay despite not being married, which {{was not something that}} was considered acceptable behavior from a [...] "respectable" [...] British woman at the time. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man. While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex. Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic were still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained [...] "venal" [...] and [...] "brutal". Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the principle of honor of the noblesse. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines." [...] Wollstonecraft was offended by the way that the Jacobins refused to grant Frenchwomen equal rights, denounced [...] "Amazons", and made it clear the role of women was to conform to Rousseau's ideal of as a helper to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined with one of the charges that she been convicted of being she had committed incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled by the way that the Jacobins had made Marie Antoinette's alleged perverted sexuality that had caused her to engage in an incestuous relationship with the Dauphin one of the central reasons for why the French people should <b>hate</b> <b>her.</b> On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined, which caused Wollstonecraft to faint when Imlay broke the news to her.|$|E
2500|$|... "He hateth putting away": This {{is another}} reason against divorce: God hates it.

Septuagint, [...] "If thou <b>hate</b> <b>her</b> and dismiss her," [...] etc.; Vulgate, [...] "If thou <b>hate</b> <b>her,</b> put her away," [...] which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned.
