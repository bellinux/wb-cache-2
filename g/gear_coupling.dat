50|$|Gear {{couplings}} {{and universal}} joints {{are used in}} similar applications. Gear couplings have higher torque densities than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower vibrations. The limit on torque density in universal joints {{is due to the}} limited cross sections of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> have high backlash to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.|$|E

5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple disk {{clutches}} operate via an electrical actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts both the armature and friction disks. The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the friction disks, transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a <b>gear,</b> <b>coupling,</b> or pulley via drive cup. The clutch slips until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|E
50|$|Prominently {{placed at}} the top are the large wind-on and rewind knobs, the {{right-hand}} one is the film advance knob, both to be operated in the clockwise direction. Next to it is a manually reset automatic frame counter dial and the chromed wind-on release button, the latter not to be mistaken for the shutter release. The front element focusing Kodak lens has a rigid lensmount set in a Kodak inter-lens shutter. The shutter is cocked by a <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> to the sprocket-wheel drum, which is trailing along with the passing film during the wind-on operation. Hence, there is no shutter cocking without a film in the camera. An automatic mechanism locates the next frame on the film by locking the advance knob. It is released for the next frame by depressing the wind-on release button before turning the wind-on knob. This prevents double exposure, but not blank frames since nothing prevents pressing the button again and advance the film. However, a red indicator is shown to the left in a slot {{on the top of}} the shutter cover that indicates the camera has been wound. The shutter release, in the shape of a rearward-pointing pin attached to the shutter release lever, is situated at about 10-o'clock at the shutter housing. It is protected from being accidentally triggered by a small cover extending over it.|$|E

40|$|A high {{pressure}} descaling pump {{was used to}} remove scale in a hot rolled band furnace. This pump was the key piece of equipment in this process which maintained the surface quality of the hot rolled band steel. Over a period of three years one pump continued to work normally, but the other pump vibrated vigorously. The motor, pump and the other system equipment were changed repeatedly, but the abnormal vibration was not eliminated. Vibration data from the two pumps was obtained， the modulation phenomenon existed in the vibration signal caused by the <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> misalignment was found, thus the envelope analysis based on the Hilbert transform was presented to demodulate the vibration signal. The frequency spectrum of the demodulated signal showed that the second order frequency characteristic was more obvious, which effectively revealed the fault information related with the <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> misalignment. It was found that the abnormal vibration was caused by coupling misalignment between the motor and the pump. After applying a more advanced alignment technique to thoroughly eliminate the misalignment in the coupling, the vibration was considerably reduced and the pump could work normally.

Second, we show the responses of this system in which one of gears have contact with a high temperature heat bath and the other gears have contact with a 0 temperature heat bath.

When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack.

Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{unbalanced}} inertias in a locomotive are briefly shown by describing measurements of locomotive motions {{as well as}} deflections in steel bridges.

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the dynamics of}} a multistage rotary vane engine is given in terms of a simplified model for combustion driving torques, power dissipation, and torque transmission. Torque transmission is effected by conjugate gear pairs attached to each unit of the engine. An argument for the design of such pairs is presented so that unwanted torque fluctuations in a flywheel attached to a member of the pair can be significantly attenuated. It is suggested that a variant of simple Cosserat dynamics offers a useful modelling tool for discussing the complex interaction between interacting gear teeth. A quasi-stationary analysis is used to place bounds of a particular choice of conjugate <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> in the presence of such interactions. It is concluded that a multistage rotary vane engine with at least two units can be usefully coupled to a single flywheel via a well-defined conjugate gear system that attenuates unwanted torque fluctuations over a broad range of rotary speeds...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 52 The {{influence}} of high pressure bushing-type oil seals on the rotordynamic {{characteristics of a}} centrifugal gas compressor, which compresses hydrogen from 1700 psi to 1800 psi is discussed. The compressor rotor is driven through a <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> by a 10000 hp steam turbine, which has a governor speed range of 7900 cpm to 8850 cpm. This machine {{has had a long}} history of exhibiting high synchronous vibration under certain operating conditions. A computer simulation identified that this rotor system can operate as two entirely different systems, which correlates well with field observations. The first system corresponds to the "normal" operating condition, where the bearings support the rotor and the oil seal bushings operate near the "centered" position. The second system corresponds to the condition where the seals carry the rotor weight and unload the bearings. This allows a level of flexibility to be introduced under the bearings, which reduces the effective damping. These rotor support changes shift the second critical speed into the operating speed range, which produces the high synchronous vibrations. In addition, the analysis indicates that the rotor is unstable in the condition where the seals support the rotor and where flexibility is introduced under the unloaded bearings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>gear</b> <b>coupling</b> {{mechanics of the}} ancient Antikythera mechanism, among whose distinctive characteristics was the triangular shaping of the teeth. The engagement of the tooth pairs is analyzed in detail, estimating the temporal variation of the speed ratio due to the back and forth shifting of the relative instant center. The admissibility of the theoretical contact points is carefully checked, and {{the magnitude of the}} successive tooth collisions is calculated, together with the energy losses arising from the particular nature of the coupling. Some interesting results are that only one tooth pair turns out to be active at each time instant and the real path may belong only to the approach or to the recess region entirely, or may split into separate sub-phases, in approach and in recess, or may even straddle both regions. The occurrence of each of these conditions depends on the average speed ratio (tooth ratio) and on the assigned clearance between the wheels. It is also found that the speed oscillation is roughly contained in a ± 10 % range and the efficiency may reach rather high values, despite the presumable crude finishing of the ancient gearwheels due to the rather rudimentary technology used {{in the construction of the}} tooth profiles...|$|E

Due to their design and manufacturing flexibility, rapid prototype materials were chosen for the grease retention shrouds. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the short and long term effects grease pose on RP materials, research was conducted on the interaction of hydrocarbon-based grease with RP materials.

To investigate the effect that grease has on RP materials, the following methods were used to obtain qualitative and quantitative data: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), interference profilometer measurements, digital camera imaging, physical shape measurement, and visual observations. To record the changes in the RP materials due to contact with the grease, data was taken before and after the grease application.

This was owing to the sporting, or indeed racing, market for the Wilson gearbox, so that the ratios could be more closely spaced. Although this same arrangement of epicyclics would become the precursor for the post-war automatic transmission, the automatic transmission's use of a torque converter, together with the broad power band and excess power of US V8 engines, meant that wider-spaced, thus fewer, ratios were acceptable.
