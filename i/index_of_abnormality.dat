This paper describes an automated prediction system based on the feature space embedding and time series forecasting methods of the SpO 2 signal; a pulsatile signal synchronised with heart beat. We develop an age-independent <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>abnormality</b> that distinguishes patient-specific normal to abnormal physiology transitions. Two different methods were used to distinguish between normal and abnormal physiological trends based on SpO 2 behaviour. The abnormality index derived by each method is compared against the current gold standard of clinical prediction of critical deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{function}} abnormalities {{constitute the}} most important cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). A restrictive ventilatory defect with a reduction in pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) is the commonest finding. Static lung compliance (Cst) is perhaps the most sensitive parameter for the detection of abnormal pulmonary mechanics. We compared the results of Cst and DLCO in patients with SSc and normal spirometry to identify early pulmonary disease. Sixteen of 50 patients had normal spirometry, eight of whom had abnormal Cst. Four of them also had a reduced DLCO. Two patients had abnormal DLCO but their Cst was normal. One of them had pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography. We conclude that Cst was helpful in diagnosing early pulmonary abnormality in 50 % of patients with normal spirometry. Among these patients Cst was a better <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>abnormality</b> than DLCO...|$|E

We investigated the occurrence of "dropping objects" in a sample of 532 patients {{affected by}} CTS, studied with a multidimensional protocol (clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented). To ensure that the definition of "dropping objects" was <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>abnormality,</b> we evaluated a control group interviewing 200 subjects. In order to evaluate if "dropping objects" was an index of more severe CTS impairment, we compared the severity measures between the patients with and without this condition. Severity of CTS multidimensionally assessed was significantly greater in patients with a history of dropped objects than those without. Moreover, "dropping objects" was more frequent in females, older patients, and in those patients with more functional impairment. The occurrence of "dropping objects" in CTS patients seems to be an index of CTS severity...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Seven out of 12 normal {{subjects}} could deliberately produce abnormal pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) which simulated disorders of {{the anterior}} visual pathways with-out detection. In six the mechanism was near-point accommodation {{and in one}} eccentric fixation. If voluntary suppression of the VEPs is suspected various modifications to the recording tech-nique may be of value. These {{include the use of}} a large check size and stimulus field and binocular stimulation. The pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) is an important and sensitive technique for detecting disease in the visual pathways. The most useful <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>abnormality</b> is prolongation of the latency of the major positivity, P 100, either absolute or rela-tive to the opposite eye. Amplitude reduction is less reliable but an inter-ocular amplitude asymmetry of 50 % is generally regarded as abnormal. The major clinical application of the VEP is in the diagnosis o...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of lethal {{ventricular}} arrhythmias leading to {{sudden cardiac death}} {{is one of the}} most important and challenging problems after myocardial infarction (MI). Identification of MI patients who are prone to ventricular tachyarrhythmias allows for an indication of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. To date, noninvasive techniques such as microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA), signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG), heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate turbulence (HRT) have been developed for this purpose. MTWA is an indicator <b>of</b> repolarization <b>abnormality</b> and is currently the most promising risk-stratification tool for predicting malignant {{ventricular arrhythmias}}. Similarly, late potentials detected by SAECG are <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> depolarization <b>abnormality</b> and are useful in risk stratification. However, the role of SAECG is limited because of its low predictive accuracy. Abnormal HRV and HRT patterns reflect autonomic disturbances, which may increase the risk of lethal ventricular arrhythmias, but the existing evidence is insufficient. Further studies of noninvasive assessment may provide a new insight into risk stratification in post-MI patients...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{methods for}} {{measuring}} brain morphologic features on magnetic resonance images are described and normative {{data are provided}} for six morphologic variables. An estimated function relating age (ranging from 8 to 79 years) to average values is given for each measure. A linear decrease over the age range is observed in {{the volume of the}} cerebrum. Linear increases are observed in measures of ventricular and sulcal fluid. A curvilinear decrease in cortical volume is found and is demonstrable even in young adults. Highly nonlinear increases in the volume of signal hyperintensities are observed in cortical and subcortical regions. The methods described may be used to provide an age-adjusted <b>index</b> <b>of</b> morphologic <b>abnormality</b> for each subject on any of the measures.

40|$|The "mean QRS {{electrical}} axis " {{has been}} defined by Ziegler (1951) as the average direction in which the excitatory process spreads throughout the ventricular myocardium. This mean axis or vector in the frontal plane may be calculated from the standard limb leads and used as an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> cardiac <b>abnormality.</b> In biometrics the term "deviation " is usually used to indicate the departure of a measurement from an established normal value. Thus in electrocardiography right or left axis deviation denotes departure of the electrical forces from the normal toward one or {{other side of the}} body. Accurate interpretation of such deviation is dependent upon well-established normal standards, and several authorities (Johnston, 1961; Ezra, 1961; Milnor, 1962) have indicated that those values currently available for older children and adolescents are inadequate.

Most studies used semiquantitative measures to determine {{the presence or absence}} <b>of</b> LB <b>abnormalities.</b> Objective: To determine the clinical consequences <b>of</b> LB <b>abnormalities</b> in the setting of AD. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Three outpatient research and treatment centers. Participants: Fourteen autopsy cases with a pathologic diagnosis <b>of</b> AD <b>abnormalities</b> and concomitant LBs followed semiannually for up to 8 years (mean age at intake, 72 years; mean age at death, 77 years; mean education, 15 years; 12 women). Main Outcome Measures: The modified Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess cognitive function. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale was used to rate extrapyramidal motor signs. Hallucinations were evaluated using the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease. Time from the first evaluation in which diagnostic criteria for probable AD were met to death was used to determine illness duration. Quantitative measures <b>of</b> LB <b>abnormalities</b> were obtained for the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Results: Independent-samples t tests were used to assess whether the degree <b>of</b> LB <b>abnormality</b> varied {{as a function of the}} presence or absence of hallucinations and extrapyramidal signs. Pearson r correlations were run to examine whether there was a relation among LB abnormalities, cognitive function, and illness duration. There was no relation between quantitative neuropathologic <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> LB <b>abnormalities</b> and clinical outcome.

40|$|We prospectively studied renal tubular {{function}} during 11 consecutive exacerbations of proliferative glomerulonephritis in 8 {{patients with}} {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). We found {{a rise in the}} fractional excretion of beta- 2 -microglobulin (p less-than-or-equal-to 0. 05) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; p less-than-or-equal-to 0. 02) during the exacerbations. These changes coincided with a fall in the glomerular filtration rate (p less-than-or-equal-to 0. 02). Since fractional excretion of beta- 2 -microglobulin and DMSA can be considered as markers for tubular function, their rise during exacerbation and their fall (p less-than-or-equal-to 0. 01) to control values during remission indicate that tubular dysfunction frequently occurs during active proliferative glomerulonephritis in SLE and can be influenced by immunosuppressive treatment. As no correlation was found between the different tubular function studies and the activity <b>index</b> <b>of</b> tubulointerstitial <b>abnormalities</b> in the renal biopsy, it is suggested that tubular function studies are probably a more sensitive indicator of tubulointerstitial disease than this activity index...|$|R
40|$|Left atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} reported as common findings in hypertension; however, their relationships with atrial anatomy are still uncertain. In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs <b>of</b> left atrial <b>abnormality</b> to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160. 5 +/- 21. 5 / 104. 7 +/- 13. 5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12 -lead ECG and a PW Doppler study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria <b>of</b> left atrial <b>abnormality</b> were: P wave wider than 0. 12 (or 0. 10) second or higher than 0. 25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1. 6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V 1 equal to or more negative than 0. 04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign <b>of</b> atrial <b>abnormality</b> was present in 34 patients (64 %); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG <b>index</b> <b>of</b> atrial <b>abnormality</b> (31 patients...|$|R
40|$|Aims/hypothesis: The use of HbA 1 c for the {{diagnosis}} of diabetes is now widely advocated despite caveats to its use. Anaemia is cited as a major confounder to this use; however, the effect <b>of</b> erythrocyte <b>indices</b> and to what degree anaemia influences HbA 1 c levels is not known. Methods: A systematic electronic database search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library was conducted for relevant articles published between January 1990 and May 2014. Included studies {{had at least one}} measurement of HbA 1 c and glucose, and a least one <b>index</b> <b>of</b> haematinic deficiency, involving non-pregnant adults, not known to have diabetes. Results: A total of 12 articles from 544 were included. The majority of studies focused on iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and, in general, demonstrated that the presence of iron deficiency with or without anaemia led to an increase in HbA 1 c values compared with controls, with no concomitant rise in glucose indices. Data on the effects <b>of</b> other <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> erythrocyte <b>abnormalities</b> on HbA 1 c are limited but show a possible decrease in HbA 1 c values with non-iron deficiency forms of anaemia. Conclusions/interpretation: HbA 1 c is likely to be affected by iron deficiency and IDA with a spurious increase in HbA 1 c values; conversely, non-IDA may lead to a decreased HbA 1 c value. This may lead to confusion when diagnosing diabetes using HbA 1 c. This review clearly identifies the need for more evidence, especially in identifying the types and degrees of anaemia likely to have significant impact on the reliability of HbA 1 c...|$|R
40|$|Using {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging and morphometric techniques, groups {{of patients with}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) were compared with {{a large group of}} normal control subjects. Measures of volume loss in specific subcortical nuclei and eight cortical regions as well as an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> white matter <b>abnormality</b> were obtained. Results indicated expected widespread cortical volume reductions in AD, which were especially severe in mesial cortices; but comparable reductions were present in subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus. In HD, the greatest reductions were present in striatal structures, but significant abnormalities were also detected in the thalamus and inferior cortical areas, especially in mesial temporal lobe structures. Significant degeneration in white matter was present in both groups, but was more dramatic in the HD patients. The significant diencephalic reduction in AD may make an important contribution to early memory deficits in the disorder, which are usually attributed to hippocampal damage. Similarly, damage to both the thalamus and mesial temporal lobe structures {{may play a role in}} the memory deficits of HD. Â© 1991...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNumerous drugs show {{significant}} behavioral, developmental, teratogenic and mutagenic effects. This study {{investigates the}} cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of two doses (20 and 40 mg/kg body weight) of the antimalarial drug mefloquine (MQ), in male mice. The parameters included the assessment of: mitotic index, cell cycle kinetics, {{and frequency of}} chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells, translocation frequency in spermatocytes and head and tail abnormalities in sperm. A high dose of mefloquine resulted in a decreased mitotic index, suggesting a doseâresponse correlation. A notable recovery in mitotic activity was observed during {{the first and third}} week post treatment, which approached the mitotic <b>index</b> <b>of</b> control. Chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> including gaps, breaks, and fragments also increased with the higher dose of mefloquine. Spermatids and secondary spermatocytes were moderately sensitive to the drug; whereas primary spermatocytes were more sensitive, and spermatogonia were highly sensitive to both doses of MQ. ConclusionMefloquine (MQ) at the doses used can be considered as a drug with a potential mutagenic effect. The results obtained from the spermatocyte diakinesis-metaphase 1 test and sperm abnormalities suggest that MQ may contribute to high incidence of birth defects and congenital abnormalities...|$|R
