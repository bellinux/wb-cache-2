AMI-tv broadcasts a selection of general entertainment programming with accommodations {{for those who are}} visually or <b>hearing</b> <b>impaired,</b> with audio descriptions on the primary audio track and closed captioning available across all programming. Along with acquired content, AMI-tv also broadcasts original series on accessibility- and disability-related topics, and has occasionally broadcast simulcasts of news and sporting events in its open described video format—including, since 2012, the Paralympic Games, an offshoot of the Olympic Games for athletes with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{provided}} five-and-a-half {{hours of}} coverage in total, and no live coverage. Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows on 4, 5, 6 and 11 September while NBC broadcast a special recapping the Games on 16 September – a week following their conclusion. The United States Olympic Committee provided additional coverage through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its {{decision not to}} broadcast any {{live coverage of the}} Games, continuing the broadcaster's trend of providing minimal coverage for the Paralympics. In Canada, rights were held by Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The coverage was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations for those who are visually or <b>hearing</b> <b>impaired.</b> AMI-tv also broadcast supplemental programming, such as a daily news program from London and a documentary series focusing on Canadian athletes at the Paralympics.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{increasing}} attention has focused on inclusive education {{and how it can}} contribute to improved teaching and learning experiences and thus to the attainment of better learning outcomes for all learners, including those with special educational needs. Initially, attention centred on inclusion in primary and secondary schools, but increasing interest is now being shown to students with special educational needs and their inclusion in tertiary institutions of learning as well. Research on the inclusion of students with special educational needs has largely focused on either one particular group of students, such as students with a particular disability, or on students with disabilities in general, such that these findings are often either only applicable to a specific group or are too general. Not many studies have attempted to compare the experiences of students with different educational needs without being too general. This study explores issues related to the experiences of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students in relation to their inclusion in three Rwandan universities. Inclusive education as an educational policy has a very young history in Rwanda and there is insufficient empirical evidence about its implementation. This study therefore adds to the little knowledge there is about this subject. The study addressed the following questions: what are the experiences of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students in Rwandan universities in terms of educational access and social inclusion in the university environment? What are the similarities and differences between the experiences of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students? What are the underlying causes of these experiences? In what ways do these experiences, either negative or positive, influence the academic performance of these students? How do these experiences influence these students’ perspectives, expectations and hopes for the future? How do the attitudes of students and lecturers in universities with deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students concerning inclusion influence the interaction between these students and lecturers {{on the one hand and}} the deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students on the other? The study was conducted using the mixed methods research approach. Triangulation was the research design employed. Data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were completed by 220 students who were neither deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> nor visually <b>impaired</b> and 55 lecturers without disabilities from three of the five Rwandan universities with deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students. Interviews were conducted with six deaf/hard of hearing students, nine visually impaired students, and three lecturers from the same universities. The study found that deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students had both positive and negative experiences in their inclusion in Rwandan universities. There were, however, major differences between the perceptions of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students concerning their inclusion in these universities. There were also differences between the deaf students and hard of hearing student about the level of their inclusion. Finally, there were significant differences between the efforts of the three universities to meet the needs of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students. This work concludes by making some recommendations for improving the inclusion of deaf/hard of <b>hearing</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> students in Rwandan universities, recommendations which could be useful to other higher institutions of learning as well in their efforts to include students with special educational needs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{identify}} the main {{delay in the}} provision of hearing aids for people with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> and identify possible problems and short-comings caused by a community based hearing aid dispensing service. DESIGN [...] Prospective cohort analysis based on data collected from patients on the duration of hearing impairment, from the referral letters in respect of the general practitioners' findings on otoscopy, and from the ear, nose, and throat assessment in the clinic with respect to the outcome of specialist otoscopy and management of the hearing impairment. SETTING [...] General ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinic. PATIENTS [...] 100 Consecutive patients aged 19 - 94 referred by general practitioners for the provision of hearing aids or for assessment and treatment of <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing.</b> RESULTS [...] Most patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> did not seek medical advice for at least a year. The time from referral by the general practitioner to the provision of a hearing aid was under two months. General practitioners consistently recognised normality on otoscopy but failed to recognise abnormality in eight of 45 cases. Seven patients required further investigation to exclude serious disease and nine had conditions amenable to surgery. CONCLUSIONS [...] The main cause of delay in treating <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> is failure by patients to seek help promptly. Specialist assessment of patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> is preferable and does not necessarily cause delay in providing hearing aids. The provision of hearing aids should remain a hospital based service...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} five {{children}} and adolescents with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> and 19 with impaired vision underwent in vitro tests (lymphocyte responsiveness and serum antibody to rubella) for retrospective diagnosis of intrauterine rubella. Tests yielded results consistent with intrauterine rubella in 30 (29 %) of the patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> but only one (5 %) of those with impaired vision. In addition, the reported incidence (10. 8 %) of rubella {{as a cause of}} deafness was obtained by questioning parents before the tests. Of 27 patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> of unknown aetiology but reported rubella contact during the pregnancy, seven (26 %) had test results consistent with intrauterine rubella. The incidence of intrauterine rubella as a cause of deafness is probably underestimated when the diagnosis is based on the presence of several classic features...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the link between the nature of {{attributions}} made by partners about behaviours modulated by hearing loss, and overall relationship satisfaction. Forty-three hearing-impaired males and 23 hearing-impaired females together with their partners, each rated the hearing-impaired person 2 ̆ 7 s hearing ability, their own relationship satisfaction, and their attributions for hypothetical behaviours typically associated with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing.</b> Attributions covered perceived causes of behaviour and perceived responsibility. The extent to which the behaviours typically associated with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing,</b> were attributed to personal causes and responsibilities was inversely correlated with relationship satisfaction. Female partners (more than male partners, or females with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing)</b> made attributions that accentuated the unpleasant implications of behaviour. Where attributions and ratings of degree of hearing loss were greater in partners than in the person with the loss, relationship satisfaction was lower. Implications for rehabilitation counselling are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} people with <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> is increasing; knowing its {{magnitude}} is essential for public health. ObjectiveTo study the prevalence and determinants of <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> in Itajaí/SC. MethodsA population-based survey based on a World Health Organization protocol. Field research was carried out from July 2008 to 2011. Procedures for evaluating hearing in households: questionnaire, measurement of noise, otoscopy, pure tone audiometry at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes: individuals above 4 years; children under 4 years: evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAE), cocleo-palpebral reflex(CPR), tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes. In the elderly population a questionnaire of perception of hearing loss was applied. ResultsThe study sample consisted of 379 individuals – 45. 38 % were males and 54. 62 % were females. Age-range: 11. 34 % up to 10 years; 64. 39 % 10 to 60 years, 24. 27 % over 60 years. Evaluation of the best hearing ear showed that 74. 1 % of residents had normal hearing, 18. 9 % had mild hearing loss, 5. 1 % had moderate hearing loss, 1. 9 % had severe <b>hearing</b> loss. Disabling <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> was detected in 26 subjects: one child (otitis media); four adults (one otitis, one noise-induced, two idiopathic); 21 elderlies (presbyacusis). Of eight children under 4 years all presented CPR, three were normal examinations, two had absent OAE bilaterally, one had absent OAE in the right ear and one in the left ear. ConclusionThe prevalence of disabling <b>impaired</b> <b>hearing</b> in Itajaí was 7 %; the highest prevalence was in the 50 -year and above age group – the main cause was presbyacusis...|$|R
