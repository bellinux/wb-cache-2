50|$|The LVS was fielded in 1985 as the Marine Corps heavy {{tactical}} vehicle system. It {{was designed}} and manufactured by the Oshkosh Corporation. The United States Army does not use the LVS, it uses the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). The key {{differences between the two}} is the LVS's ability to interchange Front Power <b>Units</b> with Rear <b>Body</b> <b>Units.</b> The LVS also steers through both standard wheel pivoting (as on a typical automobile) and hydraulic yaw steering (by articulating the Front Power Unit against the Rear <b>Body</b> <b>Unit).</b> This enabled the LVS to meet the turning radius requirements of the U.S. Marines. LVS is rated to haul up to 22.5 t on highways.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} a semi-autonomous robot for rescue operations, nicknamed RAPOSA (FOX in English). The robot {{was designed and}} built to operate in outdoor environments hostile to the human presence, such as debris resulting from the collapse of built structures, and is targeted to the tele-operated detection of potential survivors using a set of specic sensors whose information is transmitted to a remote human operator. RAPOSA's mechanical structure is composed of a main <b>body</b> and a <b>front</b> <b>body,</b> whose locomotion is supported on tracked wheels, allowing motion even when the robot is upside down. The <b>front</b> <b>body</b> has variable tilting capabilities, providing means to overcome edges higher than the robot main body (e. g., when climbing a stair) and is also useful to grab the lower ground when only the main body has ground contact. This <b>front</b> <b>body</b> has one thermal camera and two webcameras installed. Additional sensors include gas, temperature and humidity sensors, web cams, light diodes, microphone and loudspeaker. The robot uses wireless communications, with an option for tethered operation. The tether carries both power and communications, with an access point on its end, and {{can also be used}} to suspend the robot inside a deep hole. Docking and undocking the robot to the tether is accomplished remotely by the operator with the help of a camera located inside the robot, and represents the most innovative feature of RAPOSA.

The Tg500 used the Kabinenroller's <b>unit</b> <b>body,</b> <b>front</b> bodywork, front suspension, and steering system, but the rear subframe and bodywork were completely different.|$|R
