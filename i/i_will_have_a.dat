500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
500|$|In a Playboy {{interview}} with David Sheff {{shortly before his}} death, Lennon said, [...] "Sean was a planned child, {{and therein lies the}} difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will." [...] He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, [...] "Julian and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relationship in the future." [...] After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera. This way I can let [...] know if any extra coverage is needed", he explained. [...] "Often I’ll get word to the 1st [...] and he’ll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we’ll stop and address it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was because}} I longed for another taste of liberty, Davy," [...] he laughed. [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> old-fashioned time here together,--a deal of talk, {{and perhaps a}} little piquet,--who knows?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding her {{intake of}} food, Jasmuheen is quoted by the Correx Archives as saying: [...] "Generally not much at all. Maybe a few {{cups of tea}} {{and a glass of}} water, but now and then if I feel a bit bored and I want some flavour, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mouthful of {{whatever}} it is I'm wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that." [...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
2500|$|Hatton fought Manny Pacquiao on 2 May 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing. At the moment I don't have any fire in the belly for a fight or to get myself to a gym." [...] However, Hatton also added: [...] "But it has been only 13 months and I am only 31, so never count me out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be off at once, you ugly Troll,' said he; 'do {{you think}} that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> towel that has been touched by your dirty fingers?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little sweetheart, dear, it 's so cunning," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Shaw. And Maud announced {{soon after}} that she was engaged to [...] "Fweddy, 'cause Hawry slapped her" [...] when she proposed the match.|$|R
6000|$|Some day, thought <b>I,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{inscription}} {{standing there}} {{right in the}} midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world within knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would become! ...|$|R
60|$|JACK. It {{was pure}} sport. I don't know how I got the thing. Of course <b>I</b> <b>'d</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{bit of a}} row--I {{did n't know what}} I was doing--I was--I Was--well, you know--I suppose I must have pulled the bag out of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must go back}} to Buston, {{among the}} Bustonians, or he and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{stand-up}} fight of it. I rather like a stand-up fight." ...|$|E
60|$|I'd {{sooner you}} didn't write {{to her at}} all. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> message {{conveyed}} which you may be sure will save you from any humiliation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} your leg, if I can reach it," [...] {{retorted}} Keo; {{and then he}} laughed at his own joke: [...] "Guk-uk-uk-uk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, at the worst, my dear," [...] he went on, {{seeing that}} his wife still looked pale, [...] "they could burn down a tick or two, on a windy night in winter and, to satisfy you, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> extra sharp lookout kept in that direction, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{watchdog}} chained up near them.|$|R
6000|$|But Maud clapped hers, {{and gave}} a joyful bounce, as she cried, [...] "Now I can learn to cook! I love so to beat eggs! <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> apron, with a bib to it, like Polly's, and a feather duster, and sweep the stairs, maybe, with my head tied up, like Katy. Oh, what fun!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> try, anyhow,” Joyce said; “there can’t be {{anything}} special about a Malay {{that he can}} make fire more than a white man.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{chat with}} him, {{one of these}} days. And you are all quite {{sure that there is}} no {{possible}} path up, from below?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Prism. I think, dear Doctor, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stroll with you. I find I have a {{headache}} after all, and a walk might do it good.|$|E

6000|$|Ashley, laughing: [...] "May I {{change my}} mind? One talks better." [...] He lights a cigarette. [...] "And, Miss Ramsey, I believe <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cocktail, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{think what}} weeks of it you have before you?" [...] Helen explained, {{clapping}} her hands. [...] "Philippa and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{new interest in}} life--to make you fat." ...|$|E

I wish you {{to tell him that}} I want to know what his {{intentions}} are. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to demand as much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are two; {{then that}} piqu, is all right, {{if you cut}} the tail off the jacket and change the {{trimming}} a bit. The muslins only need mending and doing up to look as well as ever; you ought not to put them away torn and soiled, my child. The two black silks will be good stand-bys for years.

6000|$|... "By all means," [...] Lord Ashleigh agreed, {{touching}} a bell. [...] "We have {{several hours before}} we change for dinner. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> car round and {{take you to the}} spot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Desmond; and, at {{any rate}} for the present, I will put my {{intention}} aside; but should he ever cross my path, assuredly <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reckoning with him.|$|E
60|$|BUILDER. A film face! Good God! Now, look here! <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{daughter}} of mine {{mixed up with}} the stage. I've spent goodness knows what on your education--both of you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha! art avised of that?"
