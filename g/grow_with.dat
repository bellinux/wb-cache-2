5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> time while others decay with time. Among those that <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli can <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The {{larger the}} difference in midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to <b>grow,</b> <b>with</b> Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E

5|$|Powerball is {{a drawing}} {{game in which}} players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins the jackpot. Jackpot amounts begin at $40 million and <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> each drawing in which the jackpot is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. The jackpot is pari-mutuel, meaning that if {{multiple}} tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E

5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, Valve Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters {{a year in the}} pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to <b>grow,</b> <b>with</b> fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was bombed}} twice during the Second World War, but {{remained}} mostly unharmed. One of the bombs, in around 1940, {{was reported to}} have killed a giraffe. Nevertheless, Edinburgh was, like all zoos in Britain, affected by the war. Since bombs could fall at any time, it was not considered safe to keep dangerous animals that might escape if their enclosures were damaged. In 1941 the recently born wolves had therefore to be euthanized, along with a collection of dangerous snakes, to guard against any possible danger to the public. Despite the war the zoo continued to <b>grow,</b> <b>with</b> land to the east being purchased in 1942 and construction of a lake beginning soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence's fame {{continued}} to <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> her starring role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games film series (2012–2015), which established {{her as the}} highest-grossing action heroine of all time. She went on to earn various accolades for her collaborations with director David O. Russell. Her performance as a depressed and bipolar widow in the romance film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest winner of the award. Lawrence subsequently won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing a troubled wife in the black comedy American Hustle (2013). She also received Golden Globe Awards for her roles {{in each of these}} films, and for her performance as Joy Mangano in the biopic Joy (2015).|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always <b>grow</b> <b>with</b> Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} to tell the difference between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
