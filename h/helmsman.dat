Bienvenue arrived at Lorient on 2 January 1792, where Surcouf {{discovered}} the political changes France had undergone {{in the wake}} of the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{stage of the}} voyage to Antarctica from Buenos Aires, he was kept busy {{with a number of}} routine tasks. He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the <b>helmsman.</b> He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the <b>helmsman</b> directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{decides that}} they need to know what {{happened}} to the Valiant, and the Enterprise crosses the edge of the galaxy where it encounters a strange barrier which damages the ship's systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crewmembers are killed and both <b>helmsman</b> Gary Mitchell and ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner are knocked unconscious by the barrier's effect. When he awakens, Mitchell's eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the <b>helmsman</b> in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper {{was intended as a}} regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E
5|$|Once aboard, the Vendorian renders Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) unconscious, {{takes his}} form and orders the <b>helmsman,</b> Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) {{to steer the}} Enterprise into the Neutral Zone, where Romulan warbirds lie in wait. When the real Kirk {{eventually}} regains consciousness, he orders the Enterprise {{to get out of}} the Neutral Zone at Warp 8. The Vendorian who has been shapeshifting himself into other members of the Enterprises crew eventually reveals itself to Lieutenant Anne Nored (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), Carter Winston's fiancee who serves as a security officer aboard the Enterprise; the alien further states that the real Winston is dead but, because it has absorbed Carter's feelings for her, it can love her.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief <b>helmsman.</b> Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian <b>helmsman</b> of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the <b>helmsman</b> of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's spars, but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear {{the wreckage of the}} mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E
5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and {{her crew}} learn they have {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her <b>helmsman,</b> Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E

5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal <b>helmsman</b> Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E
25|$|Clear and exact {{communication}} between the <b>helmsman</b> and officer on the bridge is essential to safe navigation and ship handling. Subsequently, a set of standard steering commands, responses by the <b>helmsman,</b> and acknowledgment by the conning officer are widely recognized in the maritime industry. The <b>helmsman</b> repeats any verbal commands {{to demonstrate that the}} command is heard and understood. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) requires that a <b>helmsman</b> be able to understand and respond to helm orders in English.|$|E

25|$|Steering a ship {{effectively}} requires skills {{gained through}} training and experience. An expert <b>helmsman</b> has {{a keen sense}} of how a particular ship will respond to the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a <b>helmsman</b> the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled <b>helmsman</b> will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.|$|E
