500|$|The album's {{production}} was handled {{primarily by the}} Bass Brothers, Dr Dre, and Eminem. [...] The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that [...] "The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow <b>Em</b> <b>to</b> play." [...] According to the staff at IGN, [...] "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] is backed by the [...] "lulling serenity of a super silky groove". [...] "Cum on Everybody"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while [...] "My Name Is", which is built around a piano sample from British musician Labi Siffre's [...] "I Got The", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. [...] "I'm Shady" [...] was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield's [...] "Pusherman" [...] in Ice-T's song [...] "I'm Your Pusher", Eminem {{decided it would be}} more fitting to use [...] "Pusherman".|$|E

40|$|We compare three {{approaches}} to learning numerical parameters of Bayesian networks from continuous data streams: (1) the <b>EM</b> algorithm applied <b>to</b> all data, (2) the <b>EM</b> algorithm applied <b>to</b> data increments, and (3) the online EM algorithm. Our {{results show that}} learning from all data at each step, whenever feasible, leads to the highest parameter accuracy and model classification accuracy. When facing computational limitations, incremental learning approaches are a reasonable alternative. Of these, online EM is reasonably fast, and similar <b>to</b> the incremental <b>EM</b> algorithm in terms of accuracy. For small data sets, incremental <b>EM</b> seems <b>to</b> lead to better accuracy. When the data size gets large, online <b>EM</b> tends <b>to</b> be more accurate.

2500|$|The Nehemiah Memorial, {{chapters}} 1–7 and 11–13, {{may have}} circulated {{as an independent}} work before being combined with the Ezra material to form Ezra–Nehemiah. Determining {{the composition of the}} Memorial depends on the dates of Nehemiah's mission: It is commonly accepted that [...] "Artaxerxes" [...] was Artaxerxes I (there were two later kings of the same name), and that Nehemiah's first period in Jerusalem was therefore 445–433BC; allowing for his return to Susa and second journey to Jerusalem, the end of the 5th century BC is therefore the earliest possible date for the Memorial. The Nehemiah Memorial is interrupted by chapters 8–10, which concern Ezra. These have sometimes been identified as another, separate work, the Ezra Memorial (EM), but other scholars believe the <b>EM</b> <b>to</b> be fictional and heavily altered by later editors. Both the Nehemiah and Ezra material are combined with numerous lists, Censuses and other material.|$|E

I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave <b>em</b> <b>to</b> us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E
