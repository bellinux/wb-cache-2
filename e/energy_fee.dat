40|$|Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice is {{a company}} whose {{businesses}} cope with building construction and related services. The local office of Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice in Gävle has been studied in this project. The local office locates in Näringen 20 : 4, which was constructed in 1989.   The aim of this project {{is to make a}} diagnosis of the current situation; find out the most applicable way of optimizing the operation of the facility {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption, to study costs and possible savings and provide assistance with future energy management.       Firstly, a study of Energy Balance was conducted. The transmission losses was 57761 KWh; mechanical ventilation losses 3855 KWh; hot tap water heat losses 9579 KWh; natural transmission and infiltration 6897 KWh. On the other hand, heat gain from internal heat was 12707 KWh; solar radiation 8521 KWh; and supply heat 56806 KWh.   Secondly, the energy costs have been checked out. 29655 KWh of electricity was consumed in 2008. 5948 KWh was used by 20 fuses electricity and 23707 KWh was for 25 fuses. Lighting, electrical equipment and machine composed the electricity consumption. Lighting consumes 13278 KWh; equipment consumes 6452 KWh; and machine consumes 9925 KWh. Lighting electricity was composed by office lighting and workshop lighting with 4798 KWh and 8480 KWh respectively.   Electricity cost is very complicated and flexible in Sweden according to effect and consumption. The total cost of electricity consists of electricity commerce fee and electricity transmission net. Electricity commerce fee includes annual fixed fee, electricity fee, energy certificate and tax. Electricity transmission fee includes annual fixed transmission fee, grid fee and tax. Tax plays vital important role which results in huge total cost. The local office spent 43356 kr on electricity in 2008. 4798 kr was spent on office lighting, and 8480 kr was spent on workshop lighting.   On the other hand district heating fee is composed by annual fixed fee, effect fee, <b>energy</b> <b>fee</b> and tax. The local office spent 37142 kr on 56. 806 MWh of district heating in 2008. Thus, the local office purchased 86461 KWh of energies and spent 80498 kr in total in 2008.   Thirdly, to assist its energy traces and management, three tables were designed. One table is for annual energy consumption and cost in each month with all information of sub-terms on costs. One table is for annual electricity consumption for each electrical equipment and cost in accordance. Another table is for district heating consumption and cost.     At last, energy saving possibilities was explored. One way is applying improvements or maintenance of the office construction. The result of Energy Balance shows that transmission losses were 57761 KWh which occupies 74 % of the total losses, and it is the biggest bite. As the office was constructed in 1989, if improvements and maintenance can be applied to the insulation of floor, roof and walls, or change the windows, the heat losses can be reduced.   However, the other solution might be much more applicable and financial sound. Just go to Clas Ohlson to buy LED 1 W and 3 W lamps to replace the current bulbs. Spending 3009 kr to buy 51 LED incandescent bulbs of 1 W effect, and 3576 kr on 24 LED fluorescent of 3 W effect, will save 12057 kr every year. The lighting electricity consumption will be reduced from 13278 KWh / year to 264 KWh / year. Instead of spending 16017 kr on lighting, 98 % will be reduced, and only 318 kr will be paid. Moreover, the payback is really nice, only 0. 42 year. Action! The sooner the better! 20 % of energy cost will be saved...|$|E

The model was able to capture variations in reported energy demands of selected mining sites (FEE: 0. 07 to 0. 84 MJ-eq/kg ore) with deviations of 1 to 30 %. Applying the model to a database containing global mine production data resulted in energy demand median values of around 50 MJ/kg Cu irrespective of the processing route, even though median values of ore demands varied between processing routes from ca. 35 (underground, conventional processing) to 200 kg ore/kg Cu (open pit, solvent-extraction, and electrowinning), as high specific ore demands are typically associated with less energy intensive extraction technologies and vice versa.

Nevertheless, the relations of the fasting-induced changes in energy related hormones and metabolites with fasting <b>energy</b> expenditure (<b>FEE)</b> under extended fasting condition have received little attention so far. Objectives: It {{is not clear how}} energy status related hormones coordinate to cope with feed deprivation under extended fasting time conditions and how quickly these hormones re-bound to fed-state values in response to re-feeding. Thus the objectives of this study were: 1) {{to determine the effects of}} extended fasting on {{plasma concentration}} of leptin, IGF- 1, insulin, glucose, NEFA, 3 -β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and urea; and 2) to study the relations of energy status related hormones with FEE and substrate oxidations under extended fasting conditions. Materials and Methods: Eighteen six-month-old growing lambs (9 females and 9 males) were fasted for three days. Blood samples were taken one hour before (- 1 H) and 48 and 72 hours after fasting (48 H and 72 H) and two hours after re-feeding (+ 2 H) from jugular vein. During the last 22 hours of fasting, gas exchange (CO 2 production and O 2 consumption) were measured using an open-circuit indirect calorimeter.

40|$|The {{emission}} of pollutants from energy use has effects on both local air quality and the global climate, but the price of energy does not reflect these externalities. This study aims to analyze the effect that internalizing these externalities {{in the cost of}} energy would have on the US energy system, emissions, and human health. In this study, we model different policy scenarios in which fees are added to emissions related to generation and use of <b>energy.</b> The <b>fees</b> are based on values of damages estimated in the literature and are applied to upstream and combustion emissions related to electricity generation, industrial energy use, transportation energy use, residential energy use, and commercial energy use. The energy sources and emissions are modeled through 2055 in five-year time steps. The emissions in 2045 are incorporated into a continental-scale atmospheric chemistry and transport model, CMAQ, to determine the change in air quality due to different emissions reduction scenarios. A benefit analysis tool, BenMAP, is used with the air quality results to determine the monetary benefit of emissions reductions related to the improved air quality. We apply fees to emissions associated with health impacts, climate change, and a combination of both. We find that the fees we consider lead to reductions in targeted emissions as well as co-reducing non-targeted emissions. For fees on the electric sector alone, health impacting pollutant (HIP) emissions reductions are achieved mainly through control devices while Greenhouse Gas (GHG) fees are addressed through changes in generation technologies. When sector specific fees are added, reductions come mainly from the industrial and electricity generation sectors, and are achieved through a mix of energy efficiency, increased use of renewables, and control devices. Air quality is improved in almost all areas of the country with fees, including when only GHG fees are applied.

In 1959, ORSORT accepted its first international enrollments. Applications to enroll required strict clearance from the Atomic <b>Energy</b> Commission. Tuition <b>fees</b> partially offset school operating costs. Courses listed in their 1965 curricula included Analysis, Chemical Technology, Economics of Nuclear Power, Engineering Science, Experimental Physics, Nuclear Systems Laboratory, Hazards Study, Health Physics, Instrumentation and Controls, Materials, Mathematics, Meteorology, Physics, Reactor Operating Experience and Shielding. Scientific and engineering graduates of the one-year program earned certificates of completion and were awarded the degree of Doctor of Pile Engineering (D.O.P.E.). ORSORT turned out up to 100 graduates a year, many of whom became leaders in the nuclear industry, such as a former Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins. The total number of ORSORT graduates was 976. In addition to 19 US students from the Atomic Energy Commission, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and US utilities, the last graduating class of 1965 included engineering and scientific personnel sponsored by their governments in Australia, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa.|$|R
40|$|The Run IIa {{integrated}} calorimetry {{environment of}} CDF II comprises: sampling scintillator calorimeters, e. m. preshower and shower-maximum detectors (gas {{based in the}} central, scintillator based in the forward), crack-filler detectors, radioactive source calibration systems, light pulse calibration systems, dedicated triggers for critical low <b>energy</b> calibrations, new <b>FEE,</b> a Windows NT slow control system, the master online-offline Oracle Database and an online data validation framework, distilled over the previous years of CDF data taking (now based on the CERN Root). The preexisting central calorimeters are the bridge between the energy and time measurement {{of the past and}} current physics runs. New forward calorimeters (the "plugs"), built with the modern scintillating tile-fiber technique, replaced the old gas calorimeters. Together they form an integrated, general-purpose calorimetry system which has been successfully commissioned with the 2000 - 2001 collider data. The time measurement, before present only in the central hadron, has now been extended the plug hadron calorimeter. To complete the integration in Run IIb (> 2004), the central gas preshower will be replaced with a tile-fiber detector and the time information will be added also to the e. m. calorimeters. Select jet energy topics are described which show how the CDF II calorimetry has the capability to improve the measurement of the W and the top-quark masses, and to enhance the search for dijet mass peaks in conjunction with b-tagging.

40|$|Behavioral activiti es and predatory {{behavior}} of 18 American Kestrels (Falco sparverius, 9 males and 9 females) were observed for 350 + hours during 3 seasons (nonbreeding = Jan-Feb, breeding = mid-~lar-Apr, and postbreeding = late-Aug-Sept) in northern Utah. Daily energy expenditure (DEE) {{of male and}} female kestrels was estimated with a model that incorporated flight activity data from free-living birds and laboratory measurements on daytime and nighttime metabolic rates and energy costs of tissue production derived from captive kestrels. Production costs were included in the DEE for breeding and postbreeding kestrels. The energy cost of gonadal growth for males (0. 02 kcal/day) and females (0. 20 kcal/day) was added to the DEE of breeding kestrels. Breeding females expended an estimated 10. 13 kcal/day for producing an average clutch of 4. 5 eggs. The energy costs of fat deposition (2. 27 and 4. 39 kcal / day for males and females, respectively) and molt (2. 38 and 2. 72 kcal/day for males and females, respectively) were added to the DEE of postbreeding kestrels. In addition to the DEE, the model predicted nonflight energy expenditure (NFEE) and flight <b>energy</b> expenditure (<b>FEE)</b> during the day, and energy expenditure during the night (NEE). DEE of nonbreeding birds is generally higher (47. 71 kcal/day) than those from the breeding (44. 89 kcal / day) and postbreeding (42. 42 kcal / day) seasons. DEE of females (48. 69 kcal/day) is higher than males (41. 31 kcal/day) primarily because females averaged 15. 5 % heavier than males during all 3 seasons, and females have higher costs of production. Kestrels are heaviest during the nonbreeding season and the amount of metabolizable energy available is highest. DEE is lower during the breeding and postbreeding seasons because thermoregulatory demands have decreased which may allow energy to be metabolized for production. NFEE accounts for most (48. 5 %) of the DEE. Flight costs are relatively small because kestrels allocate an average 3 % of the photoperiod (25. 6 min/day) to flight activities. Egg production accounts for 20 % of the DEE of breeding females. The energy cost of fat deposition and molt accounts for 11. 6 and 15. 9 % of the DEE for postbreeding males and females, respectively. These reproductive and tissue production costs may also elevate the DEE of breeding and postbreeding females to that of nonbreeding females...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Many {{rural areas}} in Africa still lack {{adequate}} electricity supply. This {{has been identified}} as a major obstacle to development in many African nations. The high costs associated with providing electricity through national grid systems prevent many governments from delivering electricity to remote rural areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to define a strategic architecture and business model that can be used to provide solar energy to Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) in Africa. The desired outcome is a sustainable business model for solar energy provision that can be implemented in the African context. This study uses the strategic architecture framework developed by Ungerer, Pretorius and Herholdt (2011) to achieve this. Primary data was collected through interviews with industry experts and this was supplemented with a comprehensive review of current literature. An analysis of the PV market shows that solar PV has grown significantly over the past decade and the industry is already extremely competitive. The highest competitive pressures include substitute products, high buyer bargaining because of low product differentiation, and the threat of new entrants. The industry has a clearly defined value chain starting with the manufacturing of PV panels and other systems components, but goes as far as providing financing to customers. The profit potential in the industrial and commercial segments is highest and key competitors in this segment offer similar products and services. The customer analysis showed that small businesses vary considerably in the products and services they offer and that their energy needs also differ. Services that can be offered to these customers include energy efficiency assessments, system design, pre-project services, financing, system installation and system monitoring, operation and maintenance. The organisation that will implement the strategy is a company called Solshare. The organisation identified its vision and mission, and core values and defined the domain it will participate in. The commercial and industrial segments are regarded as the most appealing segments and the core product offering is energy efficiency assessments and solar installations. This will be offered through an innovative shared-solar model that also includes system financing, system monitoring and system optimisation, and will be implemented by carefully selected partners to minimise cost. Solshare’s objective is to develop a distinctive competence in financing and implementing shared-solar projects through strategic partnerships, while providing excellent customer service. It will employ is a focused low-cost strategy by providing solar energy to small businesses at the lowest cost possible, through a shared resource approach. Costs will be managed by focusing on a core set of activities and outsourcing non-core activities. The key value proposition is the development, installation and servicing of quality shared-solar solutions at the lowest cost. The cost drivers include the costs of solar system components procured from suppliers, the installation costs, salaries, marketing costs, system maintenance, and legal fees to draw up contracts and lease agreements. Income streams include <b>energy</b> assessments, <b>fees</b> charged for site selection and procurement, the installation of systems, and the monitoring and maintenance of installed systems. The capital mix consists of 30 % equity and 70 % debt and organisation aims to optimise resource velocity through completing new installations within a four month period and by employing a core team of professional sales and technical staff, while outsourcing non-core processes...|$|R
