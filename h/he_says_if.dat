6000|$|... "Yes, he can," [...] replied Dorothy; [...] "he {{talks with}} his tail, and I know {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> you could wag your tail, Billina, you wouldn't need words to talk with." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{she came}} into the small business-section she {{inspected}} a broad-beamed grocer in an alpaca coat who was bending over the apples and celery on a slanted platform in front of his store.

60|$|Philip {{wondered}} what <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew how {{the report was}} treated. It arrived at breakfast, Mr. Carey glanced at it indifferently, and passed it over to Philip.|$|R

'You will understand, I dare say, {{without my}} telling you, {{that my brother}} has come home to find my dear father's will, and to take {{possession}} of his property. <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> there is a will, he is sure I shall be left rich; {{and if there is}} none, that he will make me so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{here you}} are! We {{could not think}} {{what had become of}} you.

6000|$|... "That's a {{good deal}} so," [...] said Fulkerson, {{disordering}} his hair.
