40|$|In China <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> {{enter into}} a rapid {{development}} period now, however for many Chinese <b>dry</b> <b>ports,</b> the operation faces difficulties duo to inefficient logistics networks and cooperation relationship between <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> and seaports. Focusing on the concession cooperation mechanism of seaports and <b>dry</b> <b>ports,</b> and the environmental constraints (carbon emissions and congestion cost), a bi-objective location-allocation MILP model for the sustainable hinterland-dry ports-seaports logistics network optimization is formulated, aiming at the system logistics costs and carbon emissions to be minimized. Moreover, for the cooperation mechanism of seaports to <b>dry</b> <b>ports,</b> a parameter called cooperation cost concession coefficient is proposed for the optimization model, and a new evaluation method based on the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator is used to evaluate it. Then a location-allocation decision-making framework for the hinterland-dry port-seaport logistics network is proposed. The innovative aspect of the model {{is that it can}} proposes a effective and environment friendly <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> location strategic and also give insights into the connective cooperation relationships, and cargo flows of the network.

40|$|In recent years, {{container}} {{security at}} nodes {{in the international}} supply chains such as inland <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> {{has become a major}} concern on the international maritime agenda. If security measures and initiatives are not carefully designed and effectively implemented, they can negatively impact the entire maritime transport chain. Yet, there are limited studies conducted on this subject. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by devising a framework for measuring the quality of container security at <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> by conducting an empirical study to verify the quality of container security at 26 Indian <b>dry</b> <b>ports.</b> The study was conducted by using the triangulation of both mail survey and in-depth interview techniques. It was evident from this study that the standards of container security at the said <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> left much to be desired. The paper also analyses the reasons for such abysmal level of container security at the <b>dry</b> <b>ports.</b> Statistical analysis employed in this paper reveal that there is a clear consensus amongst all the respondents that quality of container security at <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> is a construct consisting of five dimensions, namely, equipment, personnel, policy and planning, drills and training, and security audit. In the context of Indian <b>dry</b> <b>ports,</b> the quality gaps of container security service are currently related to policy and planning, as well as security equipment. The paper also argues that the positive outcomes of container security at <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> could be realized only if the <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> employ effective container secwity management stmtegies.

25|$|After {{inauguration of}} the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) found itself to have {{accumulated}} an uncomfortable {{amount of debt}} – almost {{one third of the}} annual state budget of Ethiopia – resulting in difficulties to pay back loans. There is almost no option to provide additional funding for much-needed dry ports, storage facilities, trunk lines and access roads to have the railway integration in place to generate much-needed revenues to balance the debt. Nevertheless, mandatory trunk lines are now being built, such as the new Dire Dawa <b>Dry</b> <b>Port,</b> which alone took 12 months to negotiate and which costs per km of rails roughly 10 times that of the main Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway – Ethiopian authorities consider the costs being very high.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} trial service {{began on}} the railway after inauguration in October 2016. At that time, the railway was still not fully operational. Due to issues with the electric service in particular in the section between Mieso and Dembele, trains had to use both electrical and diesel locomotives {{to be able to}} move forward. On 9 May 2017 it was possible to perform a first thorough stress test with more than 30 trains on the line at the same time. Passenger trains ran between Furi-Labu and Dire Dawa, while freight services started in both directions between the Port of Doraleh and the Modjo <b>Dry</b> <b>Port</b> near Mojo railway station. This first test failed, which was attributed to electrical supply shortages between urban and rural areas along the line.|$|E

40|$|Globalization of the world’s economy, containerization, intermodalism and {{specialization}} have reshaped {{transport systems}} and the industries that are considered crucial for the international distribution of goods such as the port industry. Simultaneously, economies of location, economies of scope, economies of scale, optimization of production factors, and clustering of industries have triggered port regionalization and inland integration of port services especially those provided by container terminals. In this integration <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> have emerged as a vital intermodal platform for the effective and efficient distribution of containerized cargo. <b>Dry</b> <b>ports</b> have enabled port and hinterland expansion increasing the competitiveness of container terminals at seaports. In consequence, container terminals and <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> are establishing formal and informal relationships to strengthen the competitiveness of their hinterlands and to improve {{their role in the}} physical distribution of goods. This study assesses the characteristics of relationships between container terminals and <b>dry</b> <b>ports.</b> Such assessment is conducted based on a set of relationship characteristics proposed in a relationship assessment model for customer/supplier, in which <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> are given the role of suppliers of port services to container terminals. In addition, the research assesses the impact of the relationships between container terminals and <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> on inter-port competition. The main findings of the research led to conclude relationships between container terminals and <b>dry</b> <b>ports</b> are characterized by medium mutuality, low particularity, low co-operation, low conflict, low intensity, low interpersonal inconsistency, high power/dependence and medium trust. Additionally, it was concluded that such relationship characteristics impact inter-port competition in two main ways. In one hand by driving container terminals to maximize the utilization of <b>dry</b> <b>port’s</b> capabilities such as container transport/delivery, container storage, customs clearance, information systems and intermodal connections to industrial clusters. On the other hand, by constructing channels of interaction through which <b>dry</b> <b>port’s</b> benefits for hinterlands such as increase of container terminal capacity, reduction of road congestion, increase of modal shift and hinterland expansion are used as leverage in competition for containerized cargo...|$|R

60|$|But {{he had no}} more frivolity to {{complain}} of. We finished our stage {{and came to the}} inn-door with decorum, to find the house still alight and in a bustle with many late arrivals; to give our orders with a prompt severity which ensured obedience, and to be served soon after at a side-table, close to the fire and in a blaze of candle-light, with such a meal as I had been dreaming of for days past. For days, you are to remember, I had been skulking in the covered cart, a prey to cold, hunger, and an accumulation of discomforts that might have daunted the most brave; and the white table napery, the bright crystal, the reverberation of the fire, the red curtains, the Turkey carpet, the portraits on the coffee-room wall, the placid faces of the two or three late guests who were silently prolonging the pleasures of digestion, and (last, but not by any means least) a glass of an excellent light <b>dry</b> <b>port,</b> put me in a humour only to be described as heavenly. The thought of the Colonel, of how he would have enjoyed this snug room and roaring fire, and of his cold grave in the wood by Market Bosworth, lingered on my palate, amari aliquid, like an after-taste, but was not able--I say it with shame--entirely to dispel my self-complacency. After all, in this world every dog hangs by its own tail. I was a free adventurer, who had just brought to a successful end--or, at least, within view of it--an adventure very difficult and alarming; and I looked across at Mr. Dudgeon, as the port rose to his cheeks, and a smile, that was semi-confidential and a trifle foolish, began to play upon his leathery features, not only with composure, but with a suspicion of kindness. The rascal had been brave, a quality for which I would value the devil; and if he had been pertinacious in the beginning, he had more than made up for it before the end.|$|E
