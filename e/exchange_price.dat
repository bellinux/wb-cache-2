25|$|The sudden jump in {{the price}} of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the {{significant}} prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market <b>exchange</b> <b>price</b> versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35 per troy ounce (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|This {{agreement}} did {{not affect}} the independent global or regional markets in which gold was traded as a precious metal commodity. There was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain effective, the fix of the dollar to gold would have to be adjustable, or the free market price of gold would have to be maintained near the $35 official foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>price.</b> The larger the gap, known as the gold window, between free market gold price and the foreign exchange rate, the more tempting it was for nations to deal with internal economic crises by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it in the gold markets.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{contract}} for a miner is denominated against the London Metal <b>Exchange</b> <b>price,</b> minus the TC-RCs and any applicable penalties or credits. Penalties may be assessed against copper concentrates {{according to the}} level of deleterious elements such as arsenic, bismuth, lead or tungsten. Because a large portion of copper sulfide ore bodies contain silver or gold in appreciable amounts, a credit can be paid to the miner for these metals if their concentration within the concentrate is above a certain amount. Usually the refiner or smelter charges the miner a fee based on the concentration; a typical contract will specify that a credit is due for every ounce of the metal in the concentrate above a certain concentration; below that, if it is recovered, the smelter will keep the metal and sell it to defray costs.|$|E

On November 13, Brent crude reached $107.12 and was $13.24 higher than West Texas Intermediate, the largest difference since April, due to trouble in Libya and sanctions against Iran. On November 25, Benchmark crude decreased to $93.92 while Brent crude reached $110.41 after the agreement regarding Iran's nuclear program. On December 16, Benchmark crude rose to $97.44 and Brent crude reached $110.53 with good economic news from Europe and more Libya trouble. Gas was $3.23, three cents higher than a month earlier. On December 27, due to a better economy in the United States leading to higher demand, oil closed about $100 for the first time since October. Gas was $3.27, two cents below a year earlier.|$|E

This model uses the familiar constant elasticity of variance {{form for the}} volatility of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) in a continuous market.

This paper derives analytic real-world prices for zero-coupon bonds, instantaneous forward rates and options on the GOP that are both theoretically revealing and computationally efficient. In addition, the paper examines options on <b>exchange</b> <b>prices</b> and options on zero-coupon bonds under the MCEV model. The semi-analytic prices derived for options on zero-coupon bonds can subsequently be used to price interest rate caps and floors.

40|$|When cargo {{carriers}} form an alliance, {{a key issue}} to resolve is how to provide incentive for carriers to make decisions that are optimal for the alliance as a whole. We propose a mechanism that utilizes capacity <b>exchange</b> <b>prices</b> to influence carrier behavior, and analyze two approaches to modeling {{the impact of these}} prices on the behavior of an individual carrier. We find that the model used can significantly impact alliance recommendations; one proposed model always finds capacity <b>exchange</b> <b>prices</b> that yield an allocation that is budget-balanced and stable, yet cannot guarantee centralized feasibility. The second model uses more realistic control parameters and does in fact guarantee centralized feasibility. Finally, experimental results for two and three-carrier alliances are analyzed; it is determined that the benefit associated with collaborating increases with network size and fleet capacity, and depending on the characteristics of demand, fleet capacity is a more important factor. ...|$|R
