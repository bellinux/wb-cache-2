5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At {{the end of the}} match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking their weapons and valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs, took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They told the American POWs {{that they would be}} sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E

After the arrest, Nhung and Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa sat with Diệm and Nhu inside the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.|$|E
25|$|When Johnson went {{to use the}} bathroom, after {{forty minutes}} of discussion, Moore {{followed}} and discovered Johnson was a trans woman. Moore became upset, and then asked Ward to get some wire. They used the wire to bind Coleman's and Johnson's <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs. Moore put Johnson and Coleman {{in the back seat}} of their vehicle, and told Ward to follow him.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Anita {{developed}} the Body Shop's most successful campaign ever, creating Ruby, the size 16 doll, who {{was thought to}} bear a passing resemblance to Barbie. The campaign evolved from a new strategic positioning developed by ethical communications consultancy Host Universal, who created {{the image of the}} naked red-haired doll, <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> her head and wind in her hair, that became the embodiment of the campaign. The photographer was Steve Perry.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the media}} {{reported}} that several witnesses had told police {{they had seen}} Helen Scott and Christine Eadie sitting near the public telephone in the bar, talking with two men. Neither of these men have been traced or since presented themselves to police. Speculation that the killings had been the work of two men was heightened when {{it was revealed that}} the knots used to tie the girls' <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs were of different types.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him {{face down on the}} ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Jones {{retained}} {{his title}} by knocking out Australian boxer Glen Kelly in seven rounds via knockout. Jones put both <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back.

Jones landed 124 of 249 punches (50%) and Kelly connected on 42 of 171 (25%). Before this bout, Jones was controversially awarded The Ring Championship belt, despite Dariusz Michalczewski still being regarded as the Lineal champion in the same weight class.|$|E

25|$|According to Ronald Rychlak {{the clergy}} prisoners were treated {{marginally}} {{better than other}} prisoners, however treatment worsened {{in the wake of}} Papal or episcopal announcements critical of the Nazi regime, such as Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address. One Easter, the guards marked Good Friday by torturing 60 priests. Tying their <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs, chaining their wrists, and hoisting them up by the chains – tearing joints apart and killing and disabling several of the priests. The threat of further torture was used to keep the priests obedient. Food was so lacking, that prisoners would retrieve scraps from the compost pile.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Bonin's mother {{placed her}} sons in an orphanage {{in an effort}} to protect her {{children}} from their father's physical violence. This establishment was known to severely discipline the children it housed for both minor and major breaches of conduct, with the punishments administered including severe beatings, enduring various stress positions, and partial drowning in sinks filled with water. Although Bonin later freely discussed many aspects of his childhood and adolescence, he refused to discuss his memories of being housed within this establishment beyond divulging that he consented to sexual advances from older males only if his abuser would first tie his (Bonin's) <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back. He was to remain at this orphanage until the age of 9, when he returned to live with his parents in the town of Mansfield.|$|E
25|$|Bolgia 7 – Thieves: Dante and Virgil {{leave the}} bolgia of the Hypocrites by {{climbing}} the ruined rocks of a bridge {{destroyed by the}} great earthquake, after which they cross {{the bridge of the}} Seventh Bolgia to the far side to observe the next chasm. The pit is filled with monstrous reptiles: the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards, who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs. The full horror of the thieves' punishment is revealed gradually: just as they stole other people's substance in life, their very identity becomes subject to theft here. One sinner, who reluctantly identifies himself as Vanni Fucci, is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein, bursts into flames, and is re-formed from the ashes like a phoenix. Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante.|$|E

25|$|Mirren says {{transforming}} {{herself into}} the Queen came almost naturally after the wig and glasses, since she shares a default facial expression—a slightly downturned mouth – with the monarch. She regularly reviewed film and video footage of Elizabeth and kept photographs in her trailer during production. She also undertook extensive voice coaching, faithfully reproducing the Queen's delivery of her televised speech to the world. Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, {{by the end of}} production, crew members who had been accustomed to slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing straight up and respectfully folding their <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs. Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.|$|E
25|$|Post {{punishment}} {{would become}} the symbol of this detention. The principle was simple: the prisoner was attached to a post, a tree or against a wall, <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and had to remain in this position, which prevented him from moving, for {{a certain amount of}} time, without eating or drinking. Several variations on this punishment were invented, such as one where the prisoner was raised onto bricks while being attached and once he was solidly attached, the bricks were removed, rendering the punishment even more painful. The Hague Convention specified that “Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations, and orders in force in the army of the State in whose power they are. Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity as may be considered necessary”. Post punishment was applied in the German Army until its abolition on 18 May 1917; for prisoners, abolition came at the end of 1916 after a complaint by France.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 1789, {{the royal}} family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly {{composed}} of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent {{the next three years}} as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to {{the royal family}}; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children. The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in {{what is known as the}} Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he was stunned to see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times, murdering an {{unidentified}} woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> {{her back and}} stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.|$|E
25|$|Many of the victims' bodies bore {{evidence}} of mutilation {{to the eye}} sockets. Pathologists concluded the injuries were caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out {{the eyes of his}} victims. Chikatilo's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim, such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
