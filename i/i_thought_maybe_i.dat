[...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early.

Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Wow, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story."
