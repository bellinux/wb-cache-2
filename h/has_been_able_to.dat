5|$|The Scottish Challenge Cup {{has been}} {{sponsored}} several times {{since it was}} introduced in 1990. The sponsor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the name of the}} competition. There have been four sponsors since the competition's formation as well as several name changes within the duration of each sponsorship. The competition relies on revenue earned from sponsorship although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run without a sponsor over two periods but had to be suspended for one season in 1998–99 as a consequence.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{reciprocity}} may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> utilized by {{one member of}} the community to gain control over others. For instance, if an individual farmer might have had an overly abundant crop one season, that farmer might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use the excess food to hold a community feast, in which he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> persuade others subconsciously, using the theory of reciprocity, to obtain from them labor or goods that the farmer than may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use to slowly gain an economic advantage over his peers.|$|R

5|$|Gas bubbles with a radius {{greater than}} 1 micron should float {{to the surface}} of a {{standing}} liquid, whereas smaller ones should dissolve rapidly due to surface tension. The Tiny Bubble Group <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> resolve this apparent paradox by developing and experimentally verifying a new model for stable gas nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called {{on more than one}} occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.|$|E

Under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act, the network <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> introduce, {{in partnership with}} other stations, additional digital-only Network Ten affiliates. These have included Tasmanian Digital Television, launched in late 2003 in partnership with Southern Cross Broadcasting, and Mildura Digital Television in January 2006, with Prime Television Limited.|$|E

5|$|Without the {{financial}} backing he had enjoyed {{during his time}} in Formula Ford, Webber and his team struggled to find the money to fund their 1997 championship campaign. He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain significant financial and personal support from Australian rugby union legend David Campese, which helped him to complete the year. Mark has since stated he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pay back the money Campese gave him.|$|E
5|$|An {{aviation}} centre {{was constructed}} {{at the airport}} in 1976, which included a 12-unit motel, flight training school, and aircraft overhaul shop; the latter is no longer maintained. Later, a helicopter flight and training club was established. In September2007, Pacific Coastal Airlines began offering daily flights from this airfield to the Vancouver International Airport and Calgary International Airport for a period of twelve months. During this time, the airline served an 22,000passengers at the airport. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> support emergency Boeing 747landings since the 1970s, but this capability has never been tested; the runway has been used by Airbus 320s, Boeing 727-200s, Boeing 737-400s, Boeing 737-700s, and Cessna 150s.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, Hoffman has {{replaced}} the heating elements for the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover {{the rest of his}} grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in 1948, Bradman had made twenty-nine centuries in eighty innings. These centuries, with which he had accumulated 5,393 of his 6,996 Test runs, were scored with a 36.25% ratio of centuries per innings played. This allowed him to maintain a career batting average of 99.94, while no other batsman <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach 61. He would have retired with an average of 100 had he scored four more runs in his final innings.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Labcabincalifornia, member Fatlip split from The Pharcyde, and the group did not return until 2000, {{releasing}} the album Plain Rap to mediocre reviews. Though the album marked the first collaboration between the group and J-Swift, Bootie Brown and Imani had a falling out with SlimKid (now known by his birth name Tre Hardson), before the album was released, turning the group into a duo. In 2004, Imani and Bootie released the group's fourth album, Humboldt Beginnings, receiving little attention and harsh reviews. Tre and Fatlip have both since released solo albums, but no project released by the group or its members since their debut <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach the acclaim of Bizarre Ride.|$|E
5|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, {{journalist}} Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), {{co-owner of}} Millennium magazine, {{has lost a}} libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing {{a list of names}} and numbers that no one <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> decipher.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, hominid intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, photosynthesis, homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> communicate.

Most of this was {{during a period of}} six and half years from 1995 and 2001, which ended when Labor gained a 14.1% swing at the polls. In contrast to the state elections, Labor has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.|$|E
5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device {{to be able to do}} so.

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
