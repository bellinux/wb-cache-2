Every job gained within a state from an apportionment change is taken from another state. This externality suggests that the U.

The paper also shows that because the payroll component of the tax is administered on top of the existing payroll tax, the deadweight loss from this component of state corporate income taxation may be significant, despite the low tax rates. ...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{investments}} in a Member State increase the capital and, therefore, trigger higher taxes in this country. Regarding immobile factors, <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> {{works like a}} property tax. Consequently, the group experiences an incentive to locate capital in low tax countries. However, the net benefit is relevant as the group will {{take into account the}} taxes and the public goods provided by a Member State.|$|E
50|$|In principle, {{the profit}} tax becomes {{a tax on}} the factors {{included}} into the formula, i.e., capital, sales and labour. This means that the tax bill increases {{in the country where}} one of the factors rises. Thus, tax planning is still possible as companies have an incentive to shift the tax base to low-tax jurisdictions by means of transferring the formula factors, e.g., capital (i.e., assets) could be transferred from Germany to the Slovak Republic. However, tax planning under separate accounting focuses on tax base shifting whereas tax planning under <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> focuses on the location of investments.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the study are to present a comprehensive summary of the historical, legal, and political aspects of state corporate taxation and to conduct an empirical analysis of formulary apportionment. The empirical section of the study addresses the issue of <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> fairness. Five research questions are investigated [...] {{using a variety of}} multiple regression and descriptive statistics techniques [...] by observing the reported values of income, receipts, property, and payroll for 252 large corporations, operating in widely diverse industries, for the period 1977 through 1981. The study reports the following results: (1) The standard UDITPA factors of property, payroll, and receipts, taken as a set, significantly reflect income-generating processes. The explanatory power of each individual factor is highly significant, but the multicollinearity among the factors results in considerable redundancy when the factors are viewed simultaneously. (2) These factors are very stable over time. (3) The relative importance of these factors is disparate. An optimal weighting of the factors, based on the multiple regression results, would assign approximately equal weight to the property and receipts factors and a negative weighting to the payroll factor. (4) The factors, although stable over time, are not stable across industries. The income functions of different industries vary considerably, both in terms of factor dependency and factor weighting. (5) Of the eleven practical alternative <b>apportionment</b> <b>formulas</b> tested, the most appropriate, in terms of the least degree of misapportionment, varied from industry to industry. (6) Three-factor <b>apportionment</b> <b>formulas</b> generally outperformed single-factor and two-factor <b>formulas.</b> (7) <b>Apportionment</b> <b>formulas</b> which double-weighted the receipts factor consistently resulted in a higher degree of misapportionment than those formulas which equally weighted this factor. (8) Formulas which measured the property factor as undepreciated historical cost consistently outperformed those formulas which measured this factor in terms of depreciated value. (9) Formulas which measured the payroll factor in number of employees consistently outperformed alternate formulas which measured this factor in dollars of compensation. ...|$|R
40|$|First, {{this paper}} gives an {{overview}} of the progress Europe has made in its development of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Second, we use firm level data from a listed multinational to investigate how several designs for the CCCTB <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> could affect the allocation of the consolidated tax base. The design is relevant in the light of member states’ concern for protecting their tax revenues, {{as well as for the}} multinational companies’ tax minimizing possibilities. Moreover, it plays an important role in achieving an efficient and simple tax system. Simulating different <b>apportionment</b> <b>formulas,</b> the results show that including more factors and using more equal weights distributes the common tax base more equally, which could reduce the incentive to shift factors from high to low tax countries. The results also indicate that simplifying the factor definitions, leads to rather minor changes in the allocation. Using unpublished data, this study allows to investigate the consequences of different formulas in detail, which contributes to the current discussion on corporate tax harmonization in the EU.

50|$|All {{proposals}} eliminate {{profit shifting}} {{by means of}} transfer pricing or financing. Basically, <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> works like a tax on each factor included in the formula. Since the Commission {{does not want to}} question the Member States' right to set the tax rate, there is still room for tax competition via the tax rates. Due to the common tax base across the EU, it is no longer possible for Member States to compensate high-tax rates with a narrow tax base or vice versa. The Member States compete rather for real investments than for tax bases. The Commission's proposal of a CCCTB could be {{a solution to the problem}} of international corporate tax planning within the EU. In particular, the CCCTB eliminates the incentive to shift profits to low-tax countries via transfer pricing or financing. However, there is still room for tax competition between Member States as long as the tax rates are not harmonised within the EU. Moreover, the existing problems of the arm's length principle continue to exist with respect to third countries. Effectively, the CCCTB introduces a new system of <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> in addition to the system of arm's length. Thus, at present, the introduction of the CCCTB does not seem realistic on a political level, because the harmonisation requirements are high: a common tax base, a European profit allocation formula and common consolidation and anti-abuse rules would have to be introduced.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{location}} where the parent of the EU group resides, the corresponding Member State is responsible for assessing the group's tax base. Thus, the corporate income tax rate {{will be determined by}} each individual Member State. Correlated, the overall profit of the group needs to be allocated to the individual Member States to be taxed there. This allocation has to be regulated by the terms of a formula the participating Member States have previously agreed upon. The so-called <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> (FA) usually employs factors like capital, sales and labour on which the allocation is based. Prior to the allocation, these factors need to be weighted. Finally, every allocated share of profit is taxed in the respective Member State with the relevant corporate tax rate.|$|E
50|$|Each {{eligible}} {{group would}} only {{have to deal with}} one tax administration and would be subject to a single set of tax rules. All Member States which wish to adopt the new tax code {{would be able to do}} so without amending their existing tax code since CCCTB would only be another tax code in addition to the already existing 27 national tax codes. Furthermore, each Member State would have the right to set its own tax rate, thereby keeping up fiscal sovereignty and maintaining the possibility of tax competition. Also, tax planning opportunities within the EU would be eliminated to a great extent. However, the <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> creates new incentives for tax planning.

40|$|The {{draft for}} a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Directive in the European Union {{includes}} the suggestion for an <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> which allocates taxable group profits to group member corporations. These allocated profits shall then be taxed in the respective Member States. The draft directive delegates {{the right to}} define one factor of the <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula,</b> the term "Employee" to the Member States, who are therefore free to choose a narrow or a broad definition, the latter including also atypical employment schemes. Using a game-theoretic approach the paper shows that the individually rational strategy of any Member State to define "Employee" broadly so as to maximize {{the volume of the}} apportionment factor and thus maximize the allocated share of taxable income is only the best solution when tax rate differences and differences in the volume of atypical employment schemes are disregarded. If such differentials and the corporate groups' reactions to different Member States' definitions are included in modelling the game's pay-offs a narrow definition of "Employee" yields the highest individual pay-offs to the Member States involved. This change of dominant strategies is triggered by the corporate group's shifting of the employment factor from high-tax to low-tax Member States. Our paper differs from previous research on the economic effects of the CCCTB <b>apportionment</b> <b>formula</b> as it is the first paper identifying and analysing the employment factor and its distorting effects. The paper discusses possible tax minimizing strategies for corporate groups by shifting workforce and develops a model to quantify these potential relocations. Furthermore the paper presents advice to policy makers in their "Employee" definition decision and shows how Member States could use this definition to both minimize outward factor shifting and maximize inward factor shifting.

40|$|Would the {{introduction}} of a corporate tax system with consolidated tax base and <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> lead to socially wasteful mergers and acquisitions across borders? This paper analyzes a two-country model with an international investor considering acquisitions of already existing target firms in a high-tax country and a low-tax country. The investor is able to shift profits from one location to another for tax saving purposes. Two systems of corporate taxation are compared, a system with separate accounting and a system with tax base consolidation and <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment.</b> It is shown that, under separate accounting, the number of acquisitions is inefficiently ciently high in both the high tax and the low tax country.

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a general}} multi-country {{equilibrium}} {{model with a}} multinational enterprise, this paper investigates the efficiency properties of separate accounting and <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment.</b> If governments are large, i. e. {{take into account the}} effect of their statutory tax rate on the interest rate, and maximize tax revenues, tax rates under separate accounting may be inefficiently high while tax rates under <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> turn out to be inefficiently low. In case of separate accounting the tendency toward inefficiently high tax rates traces back to a negative tax base externality. In case of <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> the race to the bottom is caused by positive formula and tax base externalities. This is in contrast to previous studies ignoring interest rate effects and arguing that under separate accounting there is a race to the bottom and that under <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> there is a tendency toward inefficiently high tax rates due to a negative tax base externality.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relevance of}} firm losses for tax revenues and welfare when switching from separate accounting {{to a system of}} tax base consolidation with <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment.</b> We find that a system change unambiguously decreases tax revenues in the short run, in which neither firms nor governments can adjust their behavior, due to the cross-border loss offset inherent to <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment.</b> In the medium run, in which only firms can adjust their strategies, tax revenues are still lower under <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> if the probability of incurring losses or the costs of profit shifting are sufficiently small. However, in the long run, where both firms and governments are able to adjust their behavior after the system change, a switch from separate accounting to <b>formula</b> <b>apportionment</b> is beneficial under the aforementioned conditions.
