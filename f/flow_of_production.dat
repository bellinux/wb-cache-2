500|$|Coordination {{failure is}} another {{potential}} explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle {{even though there}} are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear {{to be the result of}} coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John (1988) expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's (1982) coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a [...] "thick-market externality" [...] that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions.|$|E

5000|$|The Soho Foundry {{was planned}} {{with a degree}} of sophistication {{unprecedented}} for a factory of its time. Its products were produced out of standardised interchangeable parts, reducing the need to supervise work as it was executed, simplifying stock control and enabling more efficient repair of faults for customers. Production processes were broken down into small tasks, enabling an extremely high degree of specialisation among workers - one document from 1801, for example, describes how a team of four specific workers was [...] "to be constantly employed in fitting nozzles". These tasks took place in a series of workshops spatially located along the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> minimising the expense and time-wastage of the movement of materials through the works.|$|E

In extreme circumstances, films are sometimes finished by the completion guarantor company (this infamously occurred during production of The Thief and the Cobbler)—an event that is traumatic for the crew and cast, and can be disastrous for a film's creative and commercial ambitions.

50|$|Milyutin's {{concept of}} city {{development}} outlined in his 1930 book, Sotsgorod (Socialist City), was superficially similar {{to an earlier}} de-urbanist concept of a linear city put forward by Mikhail Okhitovich. Unlike Okhitovich, whose linear city was terminated with industrial hubs and thus limited in growth, Milyutin's concept allowed for practically unrestricted linear growth. Milyutin as an economist was very well aware of construction costs and shortage of funds {{in the period of}} rapid industrialisation, and carefully weighed costs and benefits of available growth scenarios. His concept was based on decentralisation of industry, which needed to be spread in a thin line along a mainline railroad route, ideally - according to the natural <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> from raw supplies to finished goods (Milyutin concentrated on gigantic mass production plants like the GAZ or the STZ). The housing zone, separated from the industrial zone by a park strip, would develop concurrently, and ideally residents will be settled directly across their employers, eliminating the need for private or public transportation. In another departure from linear city, he did not insist on building housing in a continuous strip; on the contrary, Milyutin proposed a less expensive model of initially isolated housing hubs spread along the main line which might, eventually, merge into a continuous housing belt.|$|E
