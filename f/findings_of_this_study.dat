25|$|Research {{findings}} from 1998–2015 from the University of Virginia, Michigan State University, Florida State University, the University of Amsterdam, the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Stanford University, the University of California-San Francisco, the University of California-Los Angeles, Tufts University, Boston Medical Center, the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health and independent researchers also support the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> may be {{applicable}} to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to}} be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that IHM suture exhibited better UFL compared with Kakiuchi suture.|$|R
30|$|The {{essential}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that the}} diameter of aortic root is a significant factor to increase the catheter placement time (Tables 2 and 3).|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that repairs performed with non-absorbable braided sutures resulted in less separation than with absorbable monofilament sutures when {{subjected to a}} loading protocol.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{research}} within the last decade outlining some studies that {{have looked at the}} effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children. There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally. One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.|$|E
25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that {{structured}} exercise training improves autonomic {{function in}} women with early stage invasive BC {{at high risk of}} recurrence because of metabolic or endocrine milieu.|$|R
30|$|The main <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that PERCIST 1.0 {{provides}} a higher overall agreement between observers than {{when using the}} qualitative approach in categorizing early treatment response in NSCLC patients with FDG-PET/CT.|$|R
30|$|The primary <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{was that}} {{augmented}} EMG activity was observed during VH exercise, which {{was accompanied by}} muscle deoxygenation. These finding supports our hypothesis that VH during exercise enhances EMG responses.|$|R
500|$|On {{the basis}} of the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an {{international}} system should be derived from six base units to provide for the measurement of temperature and optical radiation in addition to mechanical and electromagnetic quantities. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units, abbreviated SI from the French name, [...] The BIPM has also described SI as [...] "the modern metric system". The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.|$|E
2500|$|In conclusion, the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> provide {{evidence}} of the efficacy and safety of Paxil {{in the treatment of}} adolescent depression. Here's another example of GlaxoSmithKline's commitment to Psychiatry by bringing forth 'cutting edge' scientific data. Paxil is truly a REMARKABLE product that continues to demonstrate efficacy, even in this understudied population." ...|$|E
2500|$|The article concluded: [...] "Paroxetine is {{generally}} well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents." [...] McCafferty's paragraph about worsening depression and emotional lability possibly being {{related to the}} treatment had been removed. The only SAE attributed to paroxetine in the JAACAP article was in one patient who had reported headache. The article continued: [...] "Because these serious adverse events were judged by the investigator {{to be related to}} treatment in only 4 patients (paroxetine, 1; imipramine, 2; placebo, 1), causality cannot be determined conclusively." [...] It concluded: [...] "The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of the SSRI, paroxetine, in the treatment of adolescent depression." ...|$|E
30|$|The <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{reveals that}} the model {{developed}} using the AHP and LR has good ability to determine and analyze the parameters for the degree of injury from VeR based on experts’ opinion.|$|R
30|$|The most {{significant}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{was that the}} lever sign test is a new test with higher sensitivity than the Lachman test which can be applied easily both under anaesthesia and without anaesthesia.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{is that a}} combined lesion of ACL and Segond’s fracture resulted in {{a significant increase in}} ATR when compared both to the intact knee and ACL deficient knee in static and dynamic measurements.|$|R
2500|$|March 26, 2005. Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, {{but says}} [...] "the key public-health <b>{{findings}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, {{making it the}} main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths.... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as {{the main cause of}} death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts." ...|$|E

50|$|Even in {{comparison}} with acute toxicity, chronic toxicity is poorly researched. Only the post-mortem study did little investigation on this subject. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> only showed that hair of the deceased victims contained methedrone, however, no conclusions were made regarding these findings.|$|E
50|$|A {{military}} {{study conducted}} in 2012 found that teaching individuals with lower leg chronic exertional compartment syndrome {{to change their}} running stride to a forefoot running technique abated symptoms.

50|$|A UN-sponsored study coauthored by Jewkes on male {{violence}} against women in Asia and the Pacific reported that {{a high number of}} men admitted to sexual violence. Survey researchers have questioned the plausibility of some of the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> In 2013 Jewkes also published on depressive symptoms after sexual assault, the epidemiology of child homicides and intimate femicide-suicide.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that net {{ultrafiltration}} decreased EVLWI by a {{small but}} statistically significant amount in <b>this</b> sample <b>of</b> critically ill patients, without excessively reducing cardiac preload, as measured by GEDVI, and this also resulted in a modest but significant decrease in IAP.|$|R
30|$|The main <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that the}} {{developed}} visual QC score system showed robustness within and between raters.
