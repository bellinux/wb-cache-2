30|$|This iCATHe {{technique}} {{was performed in}} an ovine ECMO model under controlled experimental conditions. The question remains: can this research be translated to the <b>human</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>environment?</b> Whilst {{the results of this}} feasibility study suggest that assessment of return cannulae positioning is significantly improved using iCATHe compared to ICE, there would be several clinical barriers that would limit or prevent clinical introduction of this technique. A major limitation to this would be the perceived risk of having an ‘open-ended’ cannula, potentially exposing the patient's circulation to air entrainment or significant bleeding. However, utilising the preventative measures employed in this study ensured that neither of these two complications occurred. Compounding this would be the requirement for meticulous sterility techniques to minimise any infection risk with an open technique. In our ovine study, no data was collected involving microbiological cultures or any control group used, so no conclusions can be drawn regarding the risk of systemic infection by using the iCATHe technique. Additionally, there may be a significant economic cost of intracardiac echocardiographic probes, and in some countries or institutions, as these may be single-use only, further increasing the cost of this technique.|$|E
3000|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} progress {{in the use of}} non-invasive imaging technologies in <b>human</b> (<b>clinical)</b> and animal (pre-clinical) research, using positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to being used in the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> on <b>human</b> patients, such as for diagnosing and tracking disease, CT and MRI have been used extensively in small animal research for visualization of normal and abnormal anatomical structures. On the other hand, PET imaging provides functional imaging of the biologic processes being studied, such as for the measurement of the inflammatory response in the lungs to an infectious disease or for quantifying the severity of a cancerous tumor via the radio-labeled glucose analog, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) [...]...|$|R

40|$|MCur, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Nursing {{students}} in South Africa {{are exposed to}} various <b>clinical</b> <b>environments</b> {{as part of the}} prescribed curriculum (SANC, 2008). These <b>clinical</b> <b>environments</b> not only positively or negatively influence nursing students but also greatly influence their decisions regarding future specialization. This relationship between the influence of the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> and the decision to apply at a specific hospital was established by Andrews et al. (2005 : 147), but little is known about how it affects the decision of nursing students to specialize in a specific area. According to the South African Nursing Council‟s statistical data, an additional qualification in operational theatre is one of the least qualifications applied for (SANC, 2012 b). This indicates that not many nursing students choose, for example, the theatre as a specialization area when their studies are completed. In light of this evidence, this study aimed to explore the influence that the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> has on the decision of nursing students to specialize in a specific area. An explorative and descriptive design, which is qualitative in nature, was followed to conduct this study. The data collection was conducted in two phases. Phase one: Nursing students‟ experiences after exposure to theatre as a <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> were explored by means of reflective essays. Data was analysed according to the principles of Tesch as described in Creswell (1994 : 154). Meetings between the researcher and an experienced co-coder resulted in consensus regarding the findings. Three main themes and eleven sub themes were identified and provided clarity on the influence of the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> on nursing students. Phase two, consisting of two focus group discussions facilitated by an expert in focus group facilitation, was completed to validate the findings from the reflective essay. This data was transcribed, analysed and the findings validated by the existing data from phase one. Conclusions drawn from this study were that the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> does influence the students‟ decision to specialize in operating theatre, but many choose not to specialize in theatre due to personal preferences.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, many {{wireless}} sensor network systems have been deployed in various real-life environments {{with the goal of}} remotely collecting data from the physical world. Such low-power wireless systems, when combined with low-power medical sensors, provide the potential to alleviate many of the manual routine tasks in the healthcare domain as well. In turn, such automation techniques in the patient monitoring process can help increase the quality of patient care at many of the busy <b>clinical</b> <b>environments</b> and disaster scenes. In this dissertation, we present MEDiSN, a {{wireless sensor network}} system for monitoring the physiological data of patients in <b>clinical</b> <b>environments</b> or victims in disaster sites. MEDiSN consists of mobile patient monitoring devices that collect physiological data and connect to a self-configuring wireless backbone network to relay their data to a gateway. As a preparation step for our deployments, we experimentally analyze the wireless channel environment at our target <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> and finally, evaluate the performance of MEDiSN in a real <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> using multiple pilot studies. Furthermore, based on the development and deployment experiences of MEDiSN, this dissertation identifies several factors that can assist wireless sensing systems to expand their horizons to new applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{component of}} undergraduate clinical {{education is a}} critical area in nursing programs. Faculty shortages have made recruitment of clinical faculty and clinical teaching more challenging. As such, alternate models of clinical faculty assignments are being explored to address faculty shortages. This article contains an extensive literature review conducted to survey models of clinical education and student satisfaction with the <b>clinical</b> <b>environment.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine student satisfaction in the <b>clinical</b> learning <b>environment</b> using articles employing the <b>Clinical</b> Learning <b>Environment</b> Inventory (CLEI) along with examining the use of alternate clinical staffing models in differing levels of undergraduate nursing students. A literature search focusing on studies published between 2002 and 2015 was conducted from 5 electronic databases. Thirty-five articles were reviewed and 22 were selected for this literature review. The studies reviewed concluded that students favored a more positive and favorable <b>clinical</b> <b>environment</b> than they perceived as being actually present. A supportive <b>clinical</b> learning <b>environment</b> is of paramount importance in securing positive teaching learning outcomes. Nurse educators can apply the results of this review in order to develop and maintain quality clinical teaching and to promote a positive, student-centric, <b>clinical</b> learning <b>environment...</b>|$|R
