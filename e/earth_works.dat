5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces {{successfully}} besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with <b>earth</b> <b>works</b> to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished {{and the top of}} the motte landscaped to its current form.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other <b>earth</b> <b>works</b> and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E

Two programs which calculate cut and fill volumes were analyzed. The first by Mark Lindult: 1980, and the second by E. Bruce MacDougal: 1981. Points of weakness were carefully studied and taken into consideration while developing the CATE program. CATE program (Calculating And Teaching <b>Earth</b> <b>Work)</b> has two major purposes. The first is to teach the grid method for calculating <b>earth</b> <b>work.</b> The second is to calculate cut and fill volumes using this method.

From the results of laboratory testing of EPS Ash, optimum mix proportion and curing time for light-weight fill and subgrade were determined...|$|R

To clarify the effect of such working conditions on the properties of the field after consolidation, investigations are made of the number of times of pass of bulldozer, soil moisture and density, corn index, and settlement of the field. The results that obtained are : a) There are considerable variations of the properties of field soil in one lot after consolidation. b) The soil moisture conditions at the <b>earth</b> <b>work</b> so significantly affect the properties of soil as to show such variable conditions. c) Non-uniformity of soil density and bearing characteristic, and large pores in subsoil cause heterogenious settlement of the field, and partial subsidence.

2500|$|Globally, {{forests are}} well known for having greater {{biodiversity}} than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations {{can be considered a}} positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees. [...] These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. <b>Earth</b> <b>works</b> and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas.

6000|$|The things {{said most}} {{confidently}} by advanced persons to crowded audiences are generally those quite opposite to the fact; {{it is actually}} our truisms that are untrue. Here is a case. There is a phrase of facile liberality uttered again and again at ethical societies and parliaments of religion: [...] "the religions of the earth differ in rites and forms, {{but they are the}} same in what they teach." [...] It is false; it is the opposite of the fact. The religions of the earth do not greatly differ in rites and forms; they do greatly differ in what they teach. It is as if a man were to say, [...] "Do not be misled {{by the fact that the}} CHURCH TIMES and the FREETHINKER look utterly different, that one is painted on vellum and the other carved on marble, that one is triangular and the other hectagonal; read them and you will see that they say the same thing." [...] The truth is, of course, that they are alike in everything except in the fact that they don't say the same thing. An atheist stockbroker in Surbiton looks exactly like a Swedenborgian stockbroker in Wimbledon. You may walk round and round them and subject them to the most personal and offensive study without seeing anything Swedenborgian in the hat or anything particularly godless in the umbrella. It is exactly in their souls that they are divided. So the truth is that the difficulty of all the creeds of the earth is not as alleged in this cheap maxim: that they agree in meaning, but differ in machinery. It is exactly the opposite. They agree in machinery; almost every great religion on <b>earth</b> <b>works</b> with the same external methods, with priests, scriptures, altars, sworn brotherhoods, special feasts. They agree in the mode of teaching; what they differ about is the thing to be taught. Pagan optimists and Eastern pessimists would both have temples, just as Liberals and Tories would both have newspapers. Creeds that exist to destroy each other both have scriptures, just as armies that exist to destroy each other both have guns.|$|E

40|$|Lined canal {{with free}} board reduces the {{friction}} slopes, which enables the canal {{to be laid}} on a flatter bed slope. This increases the command area of canal, on other hand, as the lining permits higher average velocities, the canal can be laid on steeper slope to save the cost of <b>earth</b> <b>work</b> in formation. As the lining provide rigid boundary, it ensures protection against bed bank erosion. This paper presents design equation for minimizing {{the total cost of}} canal lining and excavation with free board. This can be overcome by using manning equation. It involve lining cost, cost of <b>earth</b> <b>work</b> which varies with the excavation depth, on account of complexities of analysis. The optimal cost equation along with the corresponding section shape coefficient is useful during the planning of canal project. A network of canal represent a major cost item in an irrigation project and economy of the canal network is vital. The maximum economy is achieved by minimizing the cost of lining of canal and excavation with free board. This technique is developed by taking illustration numerical example...|$|R
