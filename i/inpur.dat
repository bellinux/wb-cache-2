40|$|An {{original}} {{method for}} {{the identification of}} Reduced Models (RM) of non linear diffusive thermal systems is proposed in this numerical study. This method derives from the Modal Identification Method developed for linear systems in previous works. Starting from a Detailed Model (DM) under matrix form, a RM structure is denined. RM's matrices are then identified through the minimization of a squared reisdues functional built with the discrepancy between system responses (DM outputs in this study) {{on the one hand}} and RM outputs on the other hand, when a specific <b>inpur</b> signal is applied. A tridimensional example with thermal conductivity depending linearly on temperature illustrates the method. In comparison with DM, computing time is drastically reduced (division by a factor greater than 1000 in the proposed example) without significant loss of accuracy...|$|E

As a result the new high effective munerical-analytical method for the solution of integral equations of dipole aerials has been suggested. The structure of exact integral equations of cylindrical, belt vibrators and also a belt vibrator near a screen has been investigated. The integral equations obtained have been reduced to infinite systems of algebraic equations of the second kind. The numerical-analytical method has been suggested for the solution of these equations. The system of integral-differential equations has been obtained. Singular operators of the non-axially symmetric excitation have been investigated. Algorithms and programs have been developed on the base of the base of the numerical-analytical method suggested.

40|$|Introduction Thermal {{processing}} has a {{huge impact}} on the textural attribute of the final food product and texture is a major factor contributing the overall quality of food. Ohmic heating is an advanced thermal processing method in which heat is internally generated within foods by passing an alternating electric current through them. Ohmic heating can volumetrically heat the entire mass of a food system, resulting in faster heating, better quality and less energy consumption than conventional thermal processing. Gradient voltage and electrode type have high effect on ohmic heating system. Materials and Methods In this study, the effect of voltage gradient and electrode type on moisture reduction time, a/b, ΔE color indexes and energy consumption were studied. For this purpose, four levels of voltage gradients (5, 7, 9 and 11 V cm- 1) and four electrode types (Aluminum, Stainless steel, Brass and Graphite) was investigated by ohmic heating in tomato paste processing. Tomato used in this study was purchased from a local market. The whole tomatoes were washed, crushed and mixed in a way that a red less-viscous liquid obtained (Fig. 1). This liquid was considered as tomato samples in the remainder of the article. Ohmic cooking experiments were conducted in laboratory scale ohmic heating system consists of a power supply, a variable transformer, power analyzer, a microcomputer, digital scale (GF- 6000) and thermometer (Dual <b>inpur</b> RTD 804 U) (Fig. 3). The ohmic cell had a PTF cylinder with an inner diameter of 0. 05 m, a length of 0. 10 m and two electrodes on both side of the cell. A hole with 3 mm diameter to insert the thermocouple was created and two holes with 5 mm diameter was created on surface of cell. One of them was used for pouring tomato puree and other for exiting steam from cell. Temperature uniformity was checked during previous heating experiments by measuring the temperatures at different locations in the test cell. Ohmic heating was accomplished till the moisture content of the tomato samples reduced from initial moisture content of as 91 (wet basis) to a safer level of 70 (wet basis). Moisture reduction time, a/b and ΔE color indexes, temperature and energy consumption were measured. Results and Discussion The results of the nonlinear mathematical model showed that the effect of different voltage gradient levels on moisture reduction time, ΔE parameters and energy consumption had a good agreement (α≤ 0. 01) as well as voltage gradient had a significant effect on a/b color index (α≤ 0. 05). Electrode type had significant effect on processing time, ΔE (α≤ 0. 01), on energy consumption and a/b index (α≤ 0. 05). Interaction of voltage gradient and electrode type was significant on processing time, energy consumption, a/b and ΔE (α≤ 0. 05). In all electrodes by increasing the voltage gradient, processing time and energy consumption were reduced. For example by increasing the voltage gradient from 5 to 11 V cm- 1, processing time and energy consumption were decreased on average 38...|$|E
