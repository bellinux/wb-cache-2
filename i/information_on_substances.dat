40|$|Britain, the law places {{duties on}} {{employers}} and suppliers {{to provide information}} to ensure {{health and safety of}} employees, so far as is reasonably practicable, and there are regulations for the appointment of employees ' safety representatives which employers are required to consult. A recent survey by HSE has shown that suppliers are the most important source of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances.</b> However, the flow of information is often obstructed by barriers between the suppliers and the companies, and within organisations. Safety representatives, where they exist, are often better informed than employers, and in companies with safety representatives accident rates are lower. Information from suppliers can be inappropriate for the end use, and the goal-setting approach which has dominated in recent years may not help the non-expert employer.

40|$|Severe {{accidents}} {{were caused}} by the unforeseen formation of hazardous substances {{in the loss of}} control of chemical systems. Several studies performed in recent years evidenced that a range of experimental techniques and of different operating conditions is available to obtain <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> that may be formed in “out of control” conditions. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the experimental devices as well as the operating conditions of experimental runs often result in important differences in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the products formed in experimental runs. Thus, the development of specific experimental strategies for the simulation of the accidental scenarios of interest is of fundamental importance in order to obtain reliable and reproducible reference data on the products that may be formed in the loss of control of an industrial chemical process. An approach to the problem is presented. The results were applied to the study of products formed in the loss of control of two chemical systems of industrial interest...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials under REACH Nanosilver as a {{case study}} Some {{adjustments}} are needed in the European chemicals legislation REACH to assess and control the risks of nanomaterials. The <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> to be provided under REACH is not sufficient to determine the specific properties of nanomaterials, nor to assess how these properties affect their behaviour and effects in humans and the environment. RIVM concluded this following research into the suitability of REACH for nanomaterials. RIVM therefore proposes an adapted set of minimum information requirements, to be applied to all nanomaterials to be registered under REACH, independent of their volume of production and import. These requirements allow a risk assessment of nanomaterials. Over the last years the use of nanomaterials has strongly increased. As yet, nanomaterials are defined as substances of which the discrete parts have at least one dimension smaller than one hundred nanometres. Due to their nanosize they have specific properties. Legislation should focus on controlling the potential hazards and risks of these nanomaterials...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} health literacy and its association with substance use among young men. METHODS: The present study was part of the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors that included 11, 930 Swiss males participating in initial screening from August 2010 to July 2011. Self-completed questionnaires covered use of three substances and three components of health literacy. RESULTS: Roughly 22  % reported having searched the Internet for health information and 16  % for <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> over the past 12  months. At-risk and not at-risk users of alcohol (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)  =  2. 50 and 1. 46), tobacco (AOR =  2. 51 and 1. 79) and cannabis (AOR =  4. 86 and 3. 53) searched for information about substances significantly more often via the Internet than abstainers. Furthermore, at-risk users reported better knowledge of risks associated with substance use and a marginally better ability to understand health information than abstainers. CONCLUSIONS: Substance users appear to be more informed and knowledgeable about the risks of substance use than non-users. Consequently, interventions that focus only on information provision may be of limited benefit for preventing substance use...|$|E
40|$|Media {{reports on}} {{research}} results by scientists at Frankfurt University concerning samples of mineral water with hormone-like effects have disconcerted consumers. In the study, such effects were determined in 12 out of 20 mineral waters tested. The scientists {{assume that this}} oestrogen-like effect originates from substances in plastic bottles that contain the mineral water. The position of the Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR) is that mineral water essentially should have no hormone-like effects. Substances such as the plasticiser DEHP, bisphenol A or nonylphenol are known to exhibit hormone-like characteristics that may have negative effects on offspring. The BfR’s assessment of the study, however, {{has led to the}} conclusion that the results do not allow any assumption on the origin of such hormonally acting substances from plastic bottles. Both tests allow no conclusion concerning the substances that cause a hormone-like effect in water. The BfR does not advise consumers to avoid the consumption of mineral water from plastic bottles as a result of Frankfurt University’s study results. The BfR has no <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> used in plastic bottle production with such hormonal effects that could migrate into the mineral water.

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of a company's {{innovation}} process (e. g. orientation and generation of ideas), sustainability concerns are only taken into account in the form of strategic guidelines. In contrast, many different methods, tools for design and impact assessment support the decision makers {{at the end of the}} innovation process (e. g. in the phases of realization and product development). An approach for environmental impact estimation of product ideas based on the guiding barrier concept by Fichter and Paech (2003) is presented. The approach uses the stage gate methodology by Cooper (2001) and action strategies for the reduction of environmental impacts of a product by Brezet/van Hemel (1997, 139). These action strategies are attributed to the different phases of the stage gate process and are supported by practical questions. The approach thereby makes use of the widespread assumption that there is a high degree of influence on product properties and corresponding environmental impacts at the early phases of the innovation process. The estimation of the environmental impact in the early phases of the innovation process is based on <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances,</b> materials and processes.

I have decided to investigate the subject and offer the results so that the fireman units could be properly trained. The paper is divided into several sections. The first aims to find out to what extent the units of the South Bohemian Fire Rescue Service are equipped with detection devices; the second examines the options of protection available to the firefighters in action; and the third section pays attention to the current standards of training given to the firefighting units deployed in the regional Service. The fourth section contains a comprehensive chapter on the noxious {{products of}} combustion, presenting available <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> most often released in their burning. The next section provides a questionnaire survey designed to map the knowledgeability of firefighters and, to permit comparisons, also the awareness that the general public has of the substances and the toxicity of their combustion products. The chapter included to present evaluations and analyses starts with a description of materials to be ignited. The products of their burning were gathered using the Tenax tubes to be later analyzed in the laboratory. The lab analysis results are presented together with the major effects that the substances may have on human body. With the questionnaire survey evaluated, it became obvious that the firefighters were considerably better informed than the general public in all areas thus surveyed. Still, the incorrect answers returned by the freighters testify to a great deal of deficiencies that the system of training should address and regular training sessions of units should remedy. Excellent results were obtained for firefighters in action, since in most cases their level of protection was found higher than what was actually necessary. The level of knowledge encountered in the general public respondents proved to be below the average. Their awareness of hazards that the combustion products may pose for humans should be heightened (e. g. through a campaign able to provide information on the subject) since the products may be detrimental to the health of just anybody...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{response}} to new psychoactive substances within the European Union (EU), the Council Decision 2005 / 387 /JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances (hereafter 'the Council Decision') established a mechanism for the rapid exchange of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> that may pose public health and social threats, including the involvement of organised crime. This provides a legal basis for {{the institutions of the}} EU and the Member States to monitor all new narcotic and psychotropic substances that appear on the European drug scene. Where necessary, the Council Decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances, so that control measures deriving from Member States' obligations to the United Nations drug control conventions (1) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances. Under Article 4 of the Council Decision, the EMCDDA and Europol, in close collaboration with their respective expert networks, the Reitox National Focal Points and Europol National Units, are assigned a central role in detecting, notifying and monitoring new psychoactive substances. The information exchange element of the Council Decision has been implemented by the EMCDDA and Europol as the European Union Early Warning System on New Psychoactive Substances (hereafter ‘Early Warning System'). In addition, where necessary, and in cooperation with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the EMCDDA and Europol may collect, analyse and present information on a new psychoactive substance {{in the form of a}} Joint Report (Article 5). This report provides evidence to the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on the need to request a risk assessment on a new psychoactive substance. Such a risk assessment examines the health and social risks posed by a new substance including: the use of, manufacture of, and, traffic in, a new psychoactive substance; the involvement of organised crime; and, the possible consequences of control measures. In order to conduct the risk assessment, the EMCDDA convenes a special meeting under the auspices of its Scientific Committee, extended with additional experts as necessary (Article 6). To ensure transparency in the implementation of the Council Decision, Article 10 stipulates that: 'The EMCDDA and Europol shall report annually to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the implementation of this Decision. The report will take into account all aspects required for an assessment of the efficacy and achievements of the system created by this Decision. The report shall, in particular, include experience relating to coordination between the system set out in this Decision and the Pharmacovigilance system'. ’ In compliance with Article 10, the EMCDDA and Europol herewith present the eighth such annual report which covers the period 1 January to 31 December 2013. The report outlines the results of the implementation, describes key issues arising from accumulated experiences, and also serves as a monitoring tool. In order to facilitate the reading of the report, the reader is referred to the full text of the Council Decision (2). The report is written as a standalone document. Annex provides the list of new psychoactive substances notified for the first time in 2013. This includes the systematic chemical name, the reporting country, and date of notification for each substance. Further information on these substances is available from the EMCDDA and Europol...|$|E
40|$|Background: Substance {{abuse and}} {{dependency}} are most common during adolescence. Adolescents {{are in a}} transitional phase, confusion can sometimes make them susceptible to taking up unfavourable habits. Attitude shaping by parents and knowledge of harmfulness of substance abuse can indirectly motivate the user {{to give up the}} habit. Substance abuse control programmes, focusing on youth, are essential, to reduce the burden of related diseases. Objectives: It was aimed to assess the level of knowledge of adolescents regarding substance abuse, to find the effectiveness of role play <b>on</b> knowledge regarding <b>substance</b> abuse among adolescents, to find out the association of knowledge scores of adolescents regarding substance abuse with selected socio demographic variables. Material and Methods: A quasi experimental, one group pre-test post-test design with evaluative approach was adopted for this study. The study was conducted at Krishna Charitable Trust’s English Medium School and Junior College, Karad, Maharashtra, India. Simple random sampling with lottery method was used for selecting the 60 subjects from VIIIth, IXth and Xth class. On the 1 st day a structured knowledge questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse and role play was conducted followed by post test on the 7 thday. Data was analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: The mean and standard deviation of the knowledge scores of the subjects in pre test was 11. 51 + 3. 55 which increased in post test after role play to 17. 5 + 2. 89. The paired ‘t’ test value were 15. 363 (p < 0. 0001) showing a significant increase in knowledge regarding substance abuse. There was an association between type of family and general <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, education of father with commonly abused substances and the total score <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, education of mother with commonly abused substances and prevention and management of substance abuse and number of children in the family was associated with general <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> abuse after role play.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether providers’ medical history-taking {{of substance use}} varies with their patients’ race or ethnicity. Design/Setting/Participants: The medical records of 1083 low-income women who delivered at an urban teaching hospital over a 12 -month period were reviewed and data were abstracted. The frequency with which {{the presence or absence}} of substance use was documented was compared among Black, Hispanic, and White women. Multivariate models predicting documentation of data <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> use were also built. Results: <b>Information</b> <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> use was more often documented in the medical records of Black and Hispanic women than in those of White women. For example, 74 % of Black women, 78 % of Hispanic women, and 60 % of White women had data on cocaine use documented in their medical records (P 5. 0001). Multivariate analyses found that, after controlling for other factors, Black (odds ratio [OR] 4. 1) and Hispanic (OR 5. 3) non-clinic patients were more likely than White non-clinic patients to have documented data <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> use history in their medical records. No racial/ ethnic disparities were found among clinic patients. Among White women, clinic patients were more likely than non-clinic patients to have documented data <b>on</b> <b>substance</b> use.
