5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{following}} season, Motherwell lost only one match in their first six making them joint leaders of the Scottish Premier League, which led to McCall being named the Clydesdale Bank Premier League manager of the month for July and August. Well continued their good form, with McCall winning the award again in October, alongside player of the month Keith Lasley, in a month when the side went unbeaten. Motherwell's <b>final</b> <b>position</b> in the Premier League was in 3rd, allowing them into the Champions League {{for the first time in}} the club's history.|$|E
5|$|In both corpora {{there were}} many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a {{relatively}} small number of such forms are very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui, which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and <b>final</b> <b>position</b> within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sporting}} {{links with}} the suburb include Caversham Football Club, one of Dunedin's most successful football teams. Caversham has reached the semi-finals of the national knockout competition (the Chatham Cup) on three occasions, {{and was a member}} of the former New Zealand National Soccer League for several seasons in the 1970s with a highest <b>final</b> <b>position</b> of fourth in 1975. They also played in the competition's final season (2003).

5|$|Péraud's {{position}} {{held steady}} {{for the next}} three days, in stages won by sprinters and breakaways. In stage 18, which finished at the Col du Galibier, Péraud finished a modest 16th, but this result moved him into the top ten overall. He dropped back out of the top ten the next day on Alpe d'Huez by finishing 12th and sufficiently behind Pierre Rolland that the younger Frenchman took his place, but regained tenth overall the next day in Grenoble thanks to his super time trial skills. He held tenth the next day to finish as the team's best-placed rider. Roche's <b>final</b> <b>position</b> was 26th.|$|E
5|$|Senna had {{qualified}} on pole position, having not set a {{lap time}} following Ratzenberger's death. He was joined {{on the front}} row by Schumacher and Berger qualified in 3rd. Damon Hill was able to improve on his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and <b>final</b> <b>position</b> on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E

5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his <b>final</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|After sacking Scottish coach Graeme Souness, Benfica {{appointed}} UEFA Champions League-winning manager Jupp Heynckes. Limited by ongoing financial difficulties, {{the club}} signings consisted of players {{either on the}} books, free transfers or loans, such as with the Spaniards Chano and Tote, the former on a free deal, and the latter on loan. Tote arrived to replace Rushfeldt, who signed and practised with the team, before being recalled back by Rosenborg with disagreements over his transfer. Benfica started their campaign with a six-game winning streak in their first seven league games, topping the league until December; when a record-setting loss to Celta de Vigo, the greatest in its history, negatively affected the team mentality, causing them to drop to third place in Matchday 19, which would become their <b>final</b> <b>position,</b> finishing eight points behind Sporting, but securing {{a position in the}} upcoming season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{finished}} in fourth place, taking the <b>final</b> <b>position</b> in the finals, and were drawn against first-place Mumbai in the semi-finals. They hosted a 3–2 {{win in the}} first leg, with all goals in the first half, including two by Hume, and advanced with a goalless draw in the second leg. In the final, away to Kerala on 18 December, Kolkata fell behind to a goal by their former player Mohammed Rafi, and equalised before half-time with a header by defender Henrique Sereno. The game went to penalties, with Hume having Atlético's first attempt saved by Graham Stack, but Elhadji Ndoye missed for Kerala and Debjit Majumder saved from Cédric Hengbart to win Kolkata the title.|$|E

5|$|Kessiakoff {{moved into}} his highest overall {{position}} after stage 12, occupying third overall just nine seconds behind the race leader. Kessiakoff at last cracked on stage 14, finishing 21st two minutes off the pace on La Farrapona. He had such time in {{hand over the}} bulk of the field, however, that he slipped only to sixth overall. Kessiakoff badly cracked in the next stage, losing almost 22 minutes and falling to 26th overall. Kiserlovski then became the team's top overall rider. He took ninth on stage 18 into Noja, part of a breakaway that took over seven minutes against the race's top riders. The result installed him into 16th place overall. He ended the Vuelta in 18th, as Astana's best-placed rider. Kessiakoff's <b>final</b> <b>position</b> was 34th, and Kashechkin was 89th.|$|E
5|$|On Canada's Top Albums/CDs chart {{conducted}} by RPM, the record debuted at number 76 {{during the week}} of February 23, 1974.

It dropped to number nine the succeeding week and spent a total of twenty-three weeks in that country, with its <b>final</b> <b>position</b> being number 91 {{during the week of}} August 3. Music Canada reported in 1978 that the record had sold over 100,000 copies in their country, prompting it to become certified Platinum. In Australia and Japan, The Way We Were peaked at positions 7 and 73, respectively. It was later certified gold in the former country after selling approximately 35,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their <b>final</b> <b>position</b> level with the eyes.|$|E

5|$|Allison J. Waldman {{predicted}} that the commercial success of the soundtrack was due to Streisand's previous role and performance in the original film, Funny Girl. In the United States, the album debuted at number 75 on the Billboard 200 chart for the week ending March 29, 1975. It continued to climb the chart in that country for several weeks before peaking at number six on May 10. It spent four weeks within the top ten of chart, {{and a total of}} 25 weeks altogether. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the soundtrack Gold for shipments upwards of 500,000 sales on September 8, 1975. On Canada's Top Albums chart conducted and published by RPM, the record debuted at number 90 during the week of April 12, 1975. Similar to its progress in the United States, it soared up the charts for several weeks before peaking at number 17 on May 17 of the same year. It spent a total of 12 consecutive weeks charting in Canada, with its <b>final</b> <b>position</b> being number 56 on June 28. It also charted in Australia, where it peaked at number 50 according to the Kent Music Report.|$|E
5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took back a little time against some of the other riders in the field in stages 17 and 20, to improve his <b>final</b> <b>position</b> to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E
