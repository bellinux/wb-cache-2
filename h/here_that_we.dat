For example, if W is a well-ordering in the nonstandard model (we suppose <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> use Kuratowski pairs so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of urelements {{in the construction of the}} model), and W has type α in NFU, then j(W) will be a well-ordering of type T(α) in NFU.|$|E
25|$|The domed {{architectural}} style evolved from Bursa and Edirne. The Ulu Cami (Holy Mosque) in Bursa {{was the first}} Seljuk mosque to be converted into a domed one. Edirne (Adrianople) was the Ottoman capital between 1365 and 1453, when Istanbul (Constantinople) became the new capital, and it is <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> witness the final stages in the architectural development which culminated {{in the construction of}} the great mosques of Istanbul. The buildings constructed in Istanbul during the period between the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453 and the construction of the Istanbul Bayezid II Mosque are also considered works of the early period. Among these are the Fatih Mosque (1470), Mahmut Paşa Mosque, the tiled palace and Topkapı Palace. The Ottomans integrated mosques into the community and added soup kitchens, theological schools, hospitals, Turkish baths and tombs.|$|E
500|$|Indestructible {{took the}} longest {{amount of time}} to title when {{compared}} to Disturbed's previous records, according to Wengren. The band had originally wanted to title the record The Night, {{because it was the first}} track to be completed, and it defined the musical direction the band wanted to use with Indestructible. The record had a song whose working title was [...] "Defend", but it eventually was re-titled [...] "Indestructible". When the title was changed, the band felt the title had, as Donegan reasoned, [...] "made a bigger statement". Draiman said they titled the record Indestructible because the title [...] "...kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking <b>here,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, ISMB was jointly {{held with}} the European Conference on Computational Biology {{for the first}} time. The conference was also {{co-located}} with the Genes, Proteins and Computers conference. This meeting, held in Glasgow, UK, was the largest bioinformatics conference ever held, attended by 2,136 delegates, submitting 496 scientific papers. Alfonso Valencia considers ISMB/ECCB 2004 {{to be an important}} milestone in the history of ISMB: [...] "it was the first one where the balance between Europe and the States became {{an important part of the}} conference. It was <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> established the rules and the ways and the spirit of collaboration between the Americans and the Europeans." [...] The success of the joint conference paved the way for future European ISMB meetings to be held jointly with ECCB.|$|E

[...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". The song exhibits Ocean as an [...] "openly fun character", opening the song with the line [...] "I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden." [...] According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always [...] "quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs". Pitchfork called [...] "Nature Feel" [...] an [...] "MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode".|$|E

In addition, Murray stated that Clouston was hurt by Heatley's remarks.

[...] "We brought in a guy the results we were very happy with. The team started {{to look like a}} real team again.

2500|$|The Doppelwegstruktur principle, {{meaning a}} double-path structure, is usually present in Arthurian novels. In the first track, the hero fights, obtains a {{reputation}} and gets married. Once his reputation is established, he [...] "rests on his laurels"; {{he is so}} satisfied with his achievements that he makes no effort to improve until a moral dilemma arises, as it happened to Erec in [...] "Erec and Enide". Erec stops caring about his knighthood duties, and focuses all his attention on his romantic life. A rumour about him being a mediocre knight spreads. It is <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> see the plot's second path: the hero regains his status {{and is able to}} balance his private life with his responsibilities as a knight.|$|E

[...] From here the story moves on to an elite school; 'Royal Heritage', in the state capital. [...] It is <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> meet the protagonist of the film, Hari Sadu; a Cricket Fanatic who believes that gully Cricket is to be played with a similar commitment as any other level of Cricket. [...] His new job is to coach the Royal Heritage team to win their sixth state championship, but he faces a stiff opposition to his coaching methods by the headstrong and arrogant members of the school team who are more impressed with Sachin’s Ferrari than his batting skills and hard work behind it.|$|E
2500|$|A 1947 {{report by}} an {{official}} inspector {{who visited the}} Home says {{some of the children}} were suffering from malnutrition, and 12 out of 31 infants examined were described as being [...] "emaciated and not thriving". It also says that the Home was overcrowded, with 271 children and 61 mothers living there. Death rates were extraordinarily high: 34 per cent of children died in the home in 1943; 25 per cent died in 1944; [...] 23 per cent died in 1945; 27 per cent died in 1946. [...] The report states [...] "The death rate amongst infants is high... The death rate had appeared to be on the decrease but has now begun to rise again. It is time to enquire into the possible cause before the death rate mounts higher." [...] The report went on to say, [...] "the care given to infants in the Home is good, the Sisters are careful and attentive; diets are excellent. It is not <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must look for cause of the death rate".|$|E
2500|$|Loudoun's {{progress}} {{towards the}} goal of capturing Louisbourg {{appears to have been}} too cautious for Hay's liking. The French had sent heavy naval reinforcements, and the attack was called off. Hay had arrived at Halifax on 9 July and was dismayed at the inaction of his superiors. Colonel John Forbes overheard him criticising the conduct of the campaign, commenting while their troops exercised in a sham attack that [...] "by God, difficult as it may be, I shall find a method of letting the mother country know what is doing <b>here,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are taken up in building sham forts and making approaches to them, when we should be employed in real attacks. The fleet should sail up the bason, and have a sham fight there; and then we might write home that we had a sea fight and taken a fort." [...] He was also said to have commented that [...] "the general was keeping the courage of his majesty's troops at bay, and expending the nation's wealth in making sham sieges and planting cabbages when he ought to have been fighting." [...] The news reached Loudoun, who had Hay arrested in July for [...] "uttering various opprobrious and disrespectful speeches". He did not press a charge though, instead suggesting that [...] "the voyage, climate and season of the year have been prejudicial to his Lordship’s health." [...] The implication was that Hay had gone mad, or suffered a breakdown, and he was closely confined for seven months while awaiting passage back to England. He volunteered for service aboard the 74-gun , which had arrived in Halifax in May 1758 under the command of Captain George Brydges Rodney, carrying Major-General Jeffery Amherst. Hay observed the successful siege and capture of Louisbourg from the Dublin, before his return to England aboard [...]|$|E
