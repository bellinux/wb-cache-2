50|$|<b>Isoxicam</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{that was}} taken or applied to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic reducing pain in certain conditions. The drug was introduced in 1983 by the Warner-Lambert Company. <b>Isoxicam</b> is a chemical analog of piroxicam (Feldene) which has a pyridine ring in lieu of an isoxazole ring. In 1985 <b>Isoxicam</b> was withdrawn from the French market, due to adverse effects, namely Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) resulting in death. Although these serious side affects were observed only in France, the drug was withdrawn worldwide.|$|E

Five days later enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 650 mg four times daily was started and continued for 10 days producing steady state trough plasma salicylate of 83 mg/l (range 21 - 133). A second 200 mg <b>isoxicam</b> dose was given 5 days after starting ASA and the plasma concentration time-curve again followed. After ASA, {{there was no}} change in lag time (0. 54 vs 0. 51 h), time to peak concentration (10 vs 10 h), or disappearance t 1 / 2 (28. 7 vs 31. 0 h) however the peak <b>isoxicam</b> concentration and AUC were reduced 18 and 22 % respectively (P less than 0. 01). Plasma protein binding of <b>isoxicam</b> studied by equilibrium dialysis was 96 +/- 1 % in the absence and 86 +/- 5 % {{in the presence of}} ASA. The reduction in binding was unrelated to plasma SA concentrations achieved or observed reductions in AUC for plasma <b>isoxicam.</b> ASA decreased plasma <b>isoxicam</b> binding, peak plasma <b>isoxicam</b> concentrations and AUC without altering the apparent disappearance half-life of total plasma <b>isoxicam</b> after a single oral dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} eight oxicam {{structures were}} studied using theoretical methods, (DFT), and the Gaussian 09 {{program in the}} gaseous and aqueous phases: 4 -meloxicam, droxicam, <b>isoxicam,</b> lornoxicam, meloxicam, normeloxicam, piroxicam, and tenoxicam. More specifically, the thermodynamic parameters, polarizability, and dipole moments of each molecule were studied. Molecules with higher amounts of unsaturated bonds and phenyl groups in their structures show increased electron delocalization, thereby increasing the diffusion of the electron clouds. 4 -meloxicam, <b>isoxicam,</b> meloxicam, piroxicam,and normeloxicam presented µ values that equaled 2. 8965, 3. 2664, 2. 1138, 2. 6692, and 3. 9705 Debye, respectively, {{and all of them}} share a formation of hydrogen bridges and lower values due to the dispersion of their charges as demonstrated by an increase in polarizability values. Furthermore, we observed that with an increasing solvent dielectric constant, the dipole moment of the molecules under study, both of which do not form hydrogen bonds, also increases. These increments are mainly seen in protic solvents...|$|E

40|$|A single-dose {{pharmacokinetic}} {{study to determine}} the effect of age on the disposition of <b>isoxicam</b> and piroxicam was carried out on a group of old and a group of young subjects Although {{there was no significant difference}} with either drug in the mean elimination half-time between the group of young and the group of old subjects, there was considerable individual variation. Steady-state levels were calculated to be three times as high in subjects with slow clearance as in those with more rapid clearance. Three weeks would be required with either drug to achieve steady-state drug levels in those subjects with slow drug-clearance KEY WORDS: Pharmacokinetics; Nonsteroidal drugs; Elderly OVER 12 % of people aged 65 years and over take prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs (1). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with a long half-life, and thus once-a-day dosage, have considerable appeal and are likely to be widely used. It is therefore important to ensure that elimination of the drug is not so prolonged in elderly subjects that dangerous accumulation occurs.

40|$|Six oxicams, sudoxicam, <b>isoxicam,</b> piroxicam, tenoxicam, {{meloxicam}} and lornoxicam, {{were compared}} {{in an attempt}} to understand why, despite close chemical structures, two of them were associated with an increased risk of toxicity in patients. Different factors have been revealed which may explain these differences. A weak association constant to human serum albumin (HSA), together with a high plasma concentration, favours a rapid increase in unbound concentration (C-u) when total plasma concentration rises (peak of absorption). Pathological states may enhance this increase when both HSA plasma concentration is decreased and free fatty acid concentrations are increased. However, the main cause of toxicity may be the existence in some subjects of HSA natural mutants whose ability to bind oxicams is markedly lower than norma...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a description of}} the temporal dynamics of myelination in zebrafish larvae, demonstrating that oligodendrocytes are present in zebrafish larvae from ld. p. f. and myelination commences by 3 d. p. f. The regulation of myelination is dependent on the growth of axons and not on their absolute size. Zebrafish larvae proved an accessible myelination model. A medium throughput in vivo reprofiling screen was consequently set up for pro-myelination compounds. Changes in oligodendrocyte lineage cell number in response to different compound treatments were assessed using the olig 2 : EGFP transgenic line of zebrafish larvae. As well as patentable compounds such as <b>isoxicam,</b> unknown for its effect on myelination, several compounds were identified that were known to affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and/or myelination, such as the sex steroid precursor, pregnenolone and the PPAR agonist, bezafibrate. The identification of these compounds therefore validated the screening techniques used. Analysis of mbp mRNA transcript levels by qPCR identified 3 compounds that decreased transcript levels, one of which was PP 2. The effect of PP 2 was specific to src kinase inhibition, confirming the importance of this known pathway in regulating myelination and again validating the screen. However, {{it was not possible to}} increase mbp levels with any of the compounds screened and there was no apparent correlation between the number of olig 2 + cells and mbp transcript levels. Preliminary further analysis of some of the compounds identified in the olig 2 + cell counting screen, such as <b>isoxicam,</b> also illustrated that the effects on olig 2 + cell number were not always specific to oligodendrocytes. Compounds with potential pro-myelination effects should now be analysed further for their specificity of effect, both in zebrafish models of myelination and in remyelination models.

40|$|Based {{on their}} hepatic {{extraction}} ratio and unbound fraction in plasma or blood drugs {{can be categorized}} as being restrictively ol non-restrictively eliminated The general perception is that drugs with very small plasma clearances and extensive plasma protein binding, such as warfarin, are eliminated restrictively. However, based on literature data for 18 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with low plasma clearances (< 60 mll min), we have shown {{that most of these}} low-extraction compounds are non-restrictively eliminated ie. their hepatic extraction ratio exceeds their unbound action in plasma. For 4 NSAIDs considered in this survey, ie. phenylbutazone and the oxicams piroxicam, <b>isoxicam</b> and tenoxicam, the hepatic extraction ratio is smaller than their unbound fraction in plasma, and their hepatic elimination, therefore, is restrictive. Our conclusion that most low-clearance NSAIDs are non-restrictively extracted is based an a number of realistic assumptions concerning their pharmacokinetic characteristics. 1. their elimination is exclusively hepatic, 2. bioavailability of their oral dosage form is complete, and 3. they do not undergo extensive reversible biotransformation enterohepatic circulation...|$|E

Fiber coated with PDMS/DVB was used for microextraction. <b>Isoxicam</b> was chosen as an internal standard. The sample of plasma was adjusted to pH 2, 5. Microextraction was composed of 20 minutes sorption and 20 minutes desorption into 200 μl of methanol. Column with reversed phase C 18 was used for separation. A solution of water and acetonitrile (60 : 40 v/v) {{was used as the}} mobile phase. Its pH was adjusted to 2, 5 using formic acid.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} influence of binding to plasma proteins and to serum on the brain extraction of four antiinflammatory oxicams. METHODS: The brain extraction of <b>isoxicam,</b> tenoxicam, meloxicam and piroxicam was investigated in rats using the carotid injection technique. Blood protein binding parameters were determined by equilibrium dialysis using human serum, human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha-l-acid glycoprotein (AAG) solutions at various concentrations. RESULTS: All oxicams had low values of brain extraction, between 19 % and 39 % when dissolved in serum, i. e. under physiological conditions. Brain efflux rate constants calculated from the wash-out curves were the same in the absence or presence of serum. Brain efflux was inversely related to the polarity of the oxicams, such that the higher their H-bonding capacity, the lower their brain efflux. The free dialyzable drug fraction was inversely related to protein concentration. However, rat brain extraction was always higher than expected from in vitro measurements of the dialyzable fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Except for piroxicam whose brain extraction was partially decreased in the presence of proteins, the serum unbound and initially bound fractions of oxicams both seem available for transfer into the brain. Modest affinities for AAG rule out any related effect. More surprising is the apparent lack of effect on brain transfer of the high-affinity binding to HSA and serum. The enhanced brain uptake of meloxicam in the presence of AAG could be a result of interactions between this globular protein and the endothelial wall...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Coxs (cyclo-oxygenases) to inhibition {{is known to}} be highly dependent on assay conditions. In the present study, the inhibitor sensitivities of purified Cox- 1 and - 2 were determined in a colorimetric assay using the reducing agent N, N, N ', N '-tetramethyl- p -phenylenediamine. With the detergent genapol X- 100 (2 mM) present, the potencies of nimesulide, ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid and naproxen were increased over 100 -fold against Cox- 2 and titration curve shapes changed, so that maximal inhibition now approached 100 %. Indomethacin, diclofenac and flosulide were not changed in potency. Similar effects of genapol were observed with inhibitors of Cox- 1. DuP- 697 and two analogues became more than 10 -fold less potent against Cox- 2 with genapol present. Tween- 20, Triton X- 100 and phosphatidylcholine, but not octylglucoside, gave qualitatively similar effects as genapol. Similar detergent-dependent changes in inhibitor potency were also observed using a [(14) C]arachidonic acid HPLC assay. The increases in potency of ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, <b>isoxicam</b> and niflumic acid towards Cox- 2 and ibuprofen towards Cox- 1 were accompanied by a change from time-independent to time-dependent inhibition. The interactions of Cox inhibitors has been described in terms of multiple binding step mechanisms. The genapol-dependent increase in inhibitor potency for ketoprofen was associated with an increase in the rate constant for the conversion of the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex to a second, more tightly bound form. The loss of potency for some inhibitors is probably due to inhibitor partitioning into detergent micelles. The present study identifies detergents as another factor that must be considered when determining inhibitor potencies against both Cox isoforms...|$|E

Delivery studies for 5 and 6 from vinyl hydrogel based on L-phenylalanine (pH 6. 5, 25 degrees C) show that concentrations of complexes ranging between 2. 5 and 5 mu M can be reached after a day. Compounds 5 and 6 show strong anti-proliferative effects on CH 1 cells (ovarian carcinoma, human) in vitro. IC(50) values being 0. 60 and 0. 37 mu M, respectively (0. 16 mu M for reference, cis-diamminodichloridoplatinum(II), cisplatin). ESI-MS measurements clearly documented that both 5 and 6 form adducts with the three model proteins ubiquitin (UBI), cytochrome c (CYT C) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the HISO(-) complex being significantly {{more effective than the}} HMEL(-) one.
