5|$|Tillman {{raised his}} profile in state {{politics}} by attending the 1876 state Democratic convention, which nominated Hampton as the party's candidate for governor. While Hampton presented a fatherly image, urging support from South Carolinians, black and white, Tillman led fifty men to Ellenton, intending to join over one thousand rifle club members who slaughtered thirty militiamen, with the survivors saved {{only by the}} arrival of federal authorities. Although Tillman and his men arrived too late to participate in those killings, two of his men murdered Simon Coker, a black state senator who had come to investigate reports of violence. They shot him as <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> in final prayer.|$|E
5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
25|$|In May 1970, Norris—on bail for {{his latest}} offense—attacked a female student {{whom he had}} been {{stalking}} {{on the grounds of}} the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees, before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.|$|E

25|$|Cao Cao died {{in early}} 220 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Cao Pi. Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and {{established}} the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor. Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi in 221 and sent Yu Jin back to Wei in autumn. By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking {{old man with a}} head full of grey hair. <b>He</b> <b>knelt</b> down, kowtowed and cried when he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Pacifies the Borders (安遠將軍).|$|E
25|$|In chapter 68, {{in another}} battle after Xiaoyao Ford, when Ling Tong was duelling with Yue Jin, Cao Xiu fired an arrow which hit Ling's horse, causing Ling {{to be thrown}} to the ground. Just as Yue Jin was moving in for the kill, he was {{suddenly}} hit by an arrow in the face. Both sides immediately rushed forth to rescue their respective generals and withdrew their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong was surprised to hear from Sun Quan that it was Gan Ning who saved him, and <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> down and thanked the latter. Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E
25|$|Nilsen {{confirmed}} that on four occasions, he had removed the accumulated bodies from beneath his floorboards and dissected the remains, and on {{three of these}} occasions, he had then disposed of the accumulated remains upon an assembled bonfire. On more than one occasion, he had removed the internal organs from the victims' bodies and placed them in bags, which he then typically dumped behind a fence to be eaten by wildlife. All {{the bodies of the}} victims killed at Melrose Avenue would be dismembered after several weeks or months of internment beneath the floorboards and Nilsen recalled that the putrefaction of these victims' bodies would make this task exceedingly vile; he recalled having to fortify his nerves with whisky and his having to grab handfuls of salt with which to brush aside maggots from the remains. Often, he would vomit as he dissected the bodies, before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims' bodies, Nilsen would engage in masturbation as <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> or sat alongside the corpse. This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of saying goodbye to his victims.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{great and}} awful oath, and he dreaded {{to think that he}} had taken it. <b>He</b> still <b>knelt,</b> put both hands over his face, and whispered, [...] "O God, my Father, help me to keep it." ...|$|R

500|$|Accounts {{suggest that}} List had a happy childhood. Developing a {{preference}} for rural areas rather than urban ones, he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of Lower Austria and Moravia, and [...] encouraged by his father [...] he began to sketch and paint the castles, prehistoric monuments, and natural scenery of these areas. According to his later account, he developed an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Austria, coming {{to believe that the}} catacombs beneath St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a pagan deity. He claimed that on an 1862 visit to the catacombs with his father, <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> before a ruined altar and swore that when an adult he would construct a temple to the ancient god Wotan.|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|After Bowie married Iman in {{a private}} {{ceremony}} in 1992, he said they knew that their [...] "real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence". Earlier that year, <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience of up to one billion people. In 1993, Bowie said he had an [...] "undying" [...] belief in the [...] "unquestionable" [...] existence of God. Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists [...] "is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give {{me a couple of}} months.... I've nearly got it right. In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali [...] "in accordance with the Buddhist rituals".|$|E

500|$|The {{day before}} their executions Guildford asked Jane {{for a last}} meeting, which she refused, {{explaining}} it [...] "would only ... increase their misery and pain, {{it was better to}} put it off ... as they would meet shortly elsewhere, and live bound by indissoluble ties." [...] Around ten o'clock in the morning of 12 February Guildford was led towards Tower Hill, where [...] "many ... gentlemen" [...] waited to shake hands with him. Guildford made a short speech to the assembled crowd, as was customary. [...] "Having no ghostly father with him", <b>he</b> <b>knelt,</b> prayed, and asked the people to pray for him, [...] "holding up his eyes and hands to God many times". He was killed with one stroke of the axe, after which his body was conveyed on a cart to the Tower chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Watching the scene from her window, Jane exclaimed: [...] "Oh, Guildford, Guildford!" [...] He was buried in the chapel with Jane who was dead within the hour.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, the Duke of Braganza met and befriended Gilbert du Motier, Marquis of Lafayette, {{a veteran}} of the American Revolutionary War who became one of his staunchest supporters. Pedro bade {{farewell}} to his family, Lafayette and around two hundred well-wishers on 25 January 1832. <b>He</b> <b>knelt</b> before MariaII and said: [...] "My lady, here is a Portuguese general who will uphold your rights and restore your crown." [...] In tears, his daughter embraced him. Pedro sailed to the Atlantic archipelago of the Azores, the only Portuguese territory that had remained loyal to his daughter. After a few months of final preparations he embarked for mainland Portugal, entering the city of Porto unopposed on 9 July. He came {{at the head of a}} small army composed of Portuguese liberals, such as Almeida Garrett and Alexandre Herculano, as well as foreign mercenaries and volunteers such as Lafayette's grandson, Adrien Jules de Lasteyrie.|$|E
500|$|Hensley was {{initially}} content following his {{experience at the}} Church of God, but he began to question whether he was living a sufficiently righteous life. He became fixated on a passage in the Gospel of Mark (Mark 16:17–18, KJV: [...] "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name... They shall take up serpents" [...] which suggested that Christians might take up [...] "serpents" [...] without injury. Psychologists Ralph W. Hood and W. Paul Williamson, {{as well as one}} of Hensley's children, have proposed that his preoccupation with this verse arose from a childhood memory of witnessing snake handling in Virginia. Hensley later recalled that he began to doubt his salvation and withdrew to a nearby hill to pray and seek God's will. In a 1947 newspaper interview, he claimed to have seen a snake while walking on the hill. He said that <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> in prayer, took hold of it, then brought it to his church and told the congregation to also prove their salvation by holding the snake.|$|E

500|$|The first {{noteworthy}} {{game for}} Bomar was a 14–0 {{loss to the}} Frankford Yellow Jackets. [...] After the Giants' poor first half, the Yellow Jackets led by 14 points. During the second half the Giants recovered somewhat, with good passes from Jack McBride to Bomar but no chance of a comeback. In a 13–0 victory over the Rochester Jeffersons, McBride threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. A 13–12 win over the Providence Steam Roller had a 24-yard touchdown pass from McBride to Bomar and an interesting ending. The Giants were backed up near their end zone, faced with a fourth down and leading 13–10. Providence was set for a blitz on the punter, but when he caught the ball <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> {{in the end zone}} for a safety (not enough for Providence to win). Against the Kansas City Cowboys, several passes from McBride to Bomar netted 24 yards in a 67-yard touchdown drive for a 9–3 victory. Bomar had possibly his best day in a 23–0 victory over the Dayton Triangles before a crowd of 18,000. Six of McBride's completed passes that day were to Bomar, including a 45-yarder for the Giants' first touchdown. Bomar was selected to NFL president Joseph Carr's all-star team.|$|E
500|$|The {{derivation}} of the Latin narcissus (...) is unknown. It {{may be a}} loanword {{from another}} language, for instance {{it is said to}} be related to the Sanskrit word nark, meaning 'hell'. It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> and gazed into a pool of water, he fell into the water and drowned. In some variations, he died of starvation and thirst. In both versions, the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation, and the person's name may have come from the flower's name. The Poet's Narcissus (N. poeticus), which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating. Again, this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited. Pliny wrote that the plant ‘narce narcissum dictum, non a fabuloso puero’ (named narcissus from narce, not from the legendary youth), i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( [...] narkao, [...] "I grow numb" [...] in Greek), not from the legend. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing, such as in the legend of Persephone, long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water.|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E

2500|$|He {{said his}} prayer was {{interrupted}} by a [...] "being from the unseen world". Smith said the being caused his tongue to swell in his mouth so that he could not speak. One account said he heard a noise behind him like someone walking towards him and then, when he tried to pray again, the noise grew louder, causing him to spring to his feet and look around, but he saw no one. In some of the accounts, he described being covered with a thick darkness and thinking that he would be destroyed. At his darkest moment, <b>he</b> <b>knelt</b> a third time to pray and, as he summoned all his power to pray, he felt ready to sink into oblivion. At that moment, he said his tongue was loosed and he saw a vision.|$|E
