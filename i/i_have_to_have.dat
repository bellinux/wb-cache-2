Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at the moment <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him.

Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: [...] "The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible." [...] On another occasion he said, [...] "When I have to read economic documents <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself." [...] He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home's premiership, the abolition of resale price maintenance.|$|E

By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his {{technique was}} [...] "working from the outside in"; he said, [...] "I can never act as myself, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else." [...] Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier [...] "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, [...] "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round." ...|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E

Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And we give them plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better?

In an interview in 2005, Arneil said, [...] "I did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> beat everyone <b>I</b> fought, that would <b>have</b> been ridiculous! <b>I</b> just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep going, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the spirit not <b>to</b> give up, no matter what they threw at me."

2500|$|Although {{their work}} is {{visually}} impressive and often controversial {{as a result of}} its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a [...] "revelation through concealment." [...] To his critics Christo replies, [...] "I am an artist, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> courage... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist?

2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. You figure it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, {{and you just have to}} grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the big dog ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E
