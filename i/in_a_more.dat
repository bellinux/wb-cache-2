5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program.

Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> central position, as a main striker.|$|E
