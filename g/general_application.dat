5|$|A <b>general</b> <b>application</b> of {{matrices}} {{in physics}} {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

25|$|Turbomachinery analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In <b>general</b> <b>application,</b> the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.|$|E

500|$|However, in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010) the Court of Appeal {{appeared}} to reject {{such an approach}} by declining to require that procedural laws must be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] {{before they can be}} regarded as law for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it [...] "too vague a test of constitutionality" [...] and said: [...] "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making." [...] On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature. It held, obiter, that law might not encompass [...] legislation (that is, bills of attainder – legislation purporting to be of <b>general</b> <b>application</b> but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation [...] "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".|$|E

[...] Most programs require between 6–7 years of study, and all offer a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. In some cases the school also allows for a second degree to be studied for {{at the same time}} (this is chosen by the student, though most students end up needing to do alternate semesters between their degrees, and mostly in careers like microbiology or biomedical engineering). For example, the Universidad de los Andes has a program whereby the medical student could graduate with both an MD and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, or an MD and a master's degree in public health. Admission to medical school varies with the school, but is usually dependent on a combination of a <b>general</b> <b>application</b> to the university, an entrance exam, a personal statement or interview, and secondary (high) school performance mostly as reflected on the ICFES score (the grade received on the state exam in the final year of secondary/high school).|$|E
