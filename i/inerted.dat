50|$|Unlike the {{inerting}} {{systems on}} military aircraft, this inerting system would run continuously to reduce fuel vapor flammability whenever the aircraft's engines are running; and its {{goal is to}} reduce oxygen content within the fuel tank to 12%, lower than normal atmospheric oxygen content of 21%, but {{higher than that of}} <b>inerted</b> military aircraft fuel tanks, which is a target of 9% oxygen. This is accomplished by ventilating fuel vapor laden ullage gas out of the tank and into the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|An {{altitude}} {{facility is}} much more complex than a sea level facility. The rocket is installed inside an enclosed chamber which is evacuated to a minimum pressure level before rocket firing. A typical chamber operating pressure of 0.16 psia (equivalent to an altitude of 100,000 feet) is established inside the chamber by some form of mechanical pumping. Mechanical pumping is typically provided by steam ejector/diffusers. If the products of combustion from the rocket firing include flammable or explosive materials, the chamber must be <b>inerted,</b> typically with gaseous nitrogen (GN2). The inerting process prevents build-up of potentially explosive materials inside the chamber or exhaust ducting.|$|E
50|$|Gas tankers {{and product}} {{carriers}} cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O2 content of 1% or less) and so use inert gas generators instead. The inert gas generator {{consists of a}} combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools the gas. A drier in series with the system removes moisture from the gas before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not <b>inerted,</b> but the hold space around them is. This arrangement allows the tanks to be kept cool using a small heel of cargo while the vessel is in ballast while retaining the explosion protection provided by the inert gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{compounds}} {{are made}} up of two main types of ingredients: active, which control pests, and <b>inert,</b> which improve performance of the pesticides. For example, some <b>inert</b> ingredients are responsible for increasing the shelf life while other <b>inert</b> ingredients act as solvents for the active ingredients. It is important to know that not all <b>inert</b> ingredients are safe. In fact, adding <b>inert</b> ingredients to pesticides requires permission from the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. EPA is {{authorized}} by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA) to register pesticide products. Pesticide products consist {{of one or more}} active ingredients, and may contain one or more <b>inert</b> ingredients (<b>inerts).</b> An <b>inert</b> ingredient is any substance, other than an active ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product. <b>Inerts</b> may be added to improve plant uptake, extend shelf-life, enhance water solubility/dispersion, make application easier, etc. Just as with pesticide active ingredients, <b>inerts</b> are evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that there will be reasonable certainty of no harm to human health or the environment if used according to the label. For its evaluation of <b>inerts</b> EPA requires the same minimal data set that it requires for active ingredients. Data requirements (at 40 CFR 158) include residue chemistry, product chemistry, toxicology for human health risk assessment, ecotoxicology, and environmental fate. Under the List Category Policy of 1987, EPA categorized <b>inerts</b> into four groups, or lists, based on toxicity.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of an <b>inert</b> confiner by a steady detonation wave in an adjacent explosive is investigated for {{cases where the}} confiner is suciently strong (or the explosive suciently weak) such that the overall change in the sound speed of the <b>inert</b> is small. A coupling condition which relates the pressure to the deflection angle along the explosive-inert interface is determined. This includes its dependence on {{the thickness of the}} <b>inert,</b> for cases where the initial sound speed of the <b>inert</b> is less than or greater than the detonation speed in the explosive (supersonic and subsonic <b>inert</b> ows, respectively). The {{deformation of}} the <b>inert</b> is then solved by prescribing the pressure along the interface. In the supersonic case, the detonation drives a shock into the <b>inert,</b> subsequent to which the ow in the <b>inert</b> consists of alternating regions of compression and tension. In this case reverberations or `ringing' occurs along both the deflected interface and outer edge of the <b>inert.</b> For the subsonic case, the flow in the interior of the <b>inert</b> is smooth and shockless. The detonation in the explosive initially defl ects the smooth interface towards the explosive. For sufficiently thick <b>inerts</b> in such cases, it appears that the deflection of the confiner would either drive the detonation speed in the explosive up to the sound speed of the <b>inert</b> or drive a precursor wave ahead of the detonation in the explosive. Transonic cases, where the <b>inert</b> sound speed is close to the detonation speed, are also considered. It is shown that the confinement affect of the <b>inert</b> on the detonation is enhanced as sonic conditions are approached from either side...|$|R
5000|$|Oil tankers {{fill the}} empty space above the oil cargo with inert gas to prevent fire or {{explosion}} of hydrocarbon vapors. Oil vapors cannot burn in air with less than 11% oxygen content. The inert gas may be supplied by cooling and scrubbing the flue gas produced by the ship's boilers. Where diesel engines are used, the exhaust gas {{may not have a}} low enough oxygen content so fuel-burning inert gas generators may be installed. One-way valves are installed in process piping to the tanker spaces to prevent volatile hydrocarbon vapors or mist from entering other equipment. [...] Inert gas systems have been required on oil tankers since the SOLAS regulations of 1974. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) publishes technical standard IMO-860 describing the requirements for inert gas systems. Other types of cargo such as bulk chemicals may also be carried in <b>inerted</b> tanks, but the inerting gas must be compatible with the chemicals used.|$|E
5000|$|MS Berge Istra was, {{like its}} sister ship [...] which {{disappeared}} under similar circumstances four years later, an ore-bulk-oil carrier - a ship which could transport both oil and iron ore. Even 30 years later, the shipping company maintained secrecy {{with regards to}} the cause of the accident. During an interview in Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet in January 2011, the retired Bergesen captain Johnny Eilers gave his view on what happened: The inert (neutral gas) systems were often unreliable those days, and many officers lacked education in how to measure gas levels. Berge Istra was loaded with ore in the main holds. But the wingtanks were not cleaned after the previous cargo of oil, thus producing oil vapor. Also the deck water seal was unreliable in heavy seas, allowing this vapor to enter the inert gas system and generator. That generator would be started on their way east, as Japan demanded <b>inerted</b> wingtanks on arrival. Starting the generator would then cause the “whole deck to open up”, just as the two survivors had explained it did. Thus the Berge Istra and Berge Vanga disasters.|$|E

40|$|During 1997 two {{different}} types of coal mine inertisation equipment were trialed in separate underground coal mines in Queensland. In April 1997 tests of the Polish developed GAG- 3 A inert gas generator were carried out at the Collinsville No 2 Coal Mine. These demonstrations indicated that the GAG- 3 A device was applicable in underground coal mines and that with respect to inertisation rate the device outperformed all other currently available techniques. The unit was assembled rapidly and operated safely during surface and underground trials and no mechanical problems were encountered with the device. The GAG- 3 A is not suitable for every fIre scenario particularly if large volumes of fresh air are being drawn into the mine(where multiple units may be required), but with respect to the selection criteria developed by the Moura Implementation Process Task Group 5 criteria, the unit performed up to the specifications required. In May 1997 tests were carried out at the Cook and Laleham Collieries using a Tomlinson diesel boiler. These demonstrations indicated that a low volume generator, such as the boiler, can proactively inert a large goaf area effectively. At Cook a volume of approximately 700 000 mJ was <b>inerted</b> over 10 days and at Laleham an area of approximately 70 000 m 3 was <b>inerted</b> over 2 days.
