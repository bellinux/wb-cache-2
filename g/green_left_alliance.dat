50|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the newspaper Kotimaa, on March 11, 2010, the parliament elected in Spring 2007 was split on the issue of gay marriage, with 54% opposing and 46% supporting a gender-neutral marriage law. However, four of the eight parties in the Parliament — the Social Democrats, the <b>Greens,</b> the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Swedish People's Party — had declared their support for same-sex marriage in their general position papers. The National Coalition put gay marriage on its agenda in its party congress in June 2010, though the vice-chairman of its parliament group Ben Zyskowicz did not believe gay marriage would be approved at least by the NCP during the upcoming four years, basing his view on the fact that majority of the current NCP MPs are against it. The Centre Party had no general position on gay marriage, though it opposes adoption rights for same-sex couples. The Christian Democrats and the True Finns took a negative stance on gay marriage on their platforms.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, the {{enlargement}} of the European Union {{led to the creation}} of the Nordic <b>Green</b> <b>Left</b> group of parties.

50|$|Currently, many Green Parties {{around the}} world, {{such as the}} Dutch Green Left Party (GroenLinks) , contain strong eco-socialist elements. Radical Red-green alliances have been formed in many {{countries}} by eco-socialists, radical Greens and other radical left groups. In Denmark, the Red-Green Alliance was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the European Parliament, a number of far-left parties from Northern Europe have organized themselves into the Nordic <b>Green</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance.</b> Red Greens feature heavily in the Green Party of Saskatchewan (in Canada but not necessarily affiliated to the Green Party of Canada) and then-recently GPUS that officially adopted ideology within party.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century there emerged anarcho-naturism as {{the fusion of}} anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France, Spain, Cuba and Portugal. Social ecology {{is closely related to}} the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and {{influenced}} by anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Bookchin's first book, Our Synthetic Environment, was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. His groundbreaking essay [...] "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" [...] introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics. In the 1970s, Barry Commoner, suggesting a left-wing response to the Limits to Growth model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulated that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures. The 1990s saw the socialist feminists Mary Mellor and Ariel Salleh address environmental issues within an eco-socialist paradigm. With the rising profile of the anti-globalisation movement in the Global South, an [...] "environmentalism of the poor", combining ecological awareness and social justice, has also become prominent. David Pepper also released his important work, Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice, in 1994, which critiques the current approach of many within Green politics, particularly deep ecologists. Currently, many Green Parties around the world, such as the Dutch Green Left Party (GroenLinks), contain strong eco-socialist elements. Radical Red-green alliances have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical Greens and other radical left groups. In Denmark, the Red-Green Alliance was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the European Parliament, a number of far-left parties from Northern Europe have organised themselves into the Nordic <b>Green</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SF is a Nordic <b>Green</b> <b>Left</b> party {{like the}} Swedish Left Party, the Norwegian Socialist Left Party, the Finnish <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> and the Icelandic Left-Green Movement.

50|$|Tennilä was {{internal}} {{critic of}} <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> politics and was dismissed in 1995 from <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance's</b> parliamentary group as he opposed joining the Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet. He returned {{to list of}} <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> in 1999 elections.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Marszałek {{was elected}} a city {{councilor}} representing Democratic <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance.</b> He was subsequently elected in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 representing Democratic <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> - Labour Union, Left and Democrats and Democratic <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> once again.|$|R
50|$|Some Green {{parties have}} been part of {{governing}} coalitions. The first one was the Finnish Green League that entered government in 1995. The Italian Federation of the Greens, the French Greens, the German Alliance '90/The Greens and both Belgian Green parties, the French-speaking Ecolo and the Dutch-speaking Agalev were part of government during the late 1990s. Most successful was the Latvian Green Party, who supplied the Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004. The Swedish Green party was a long term supporter of the social-democratic minority government until the election 2006 when the social-democratic party lost. The Irish Green Party were in government from 2007 until January 2011 when the party withdrew their support for the ruling coalition. During their period in office, the Irish Green Party held two Cabinet portfolios including Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.In Scandinavia, left-wing socialist parties have formed the Nordic <b>Green</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance.</b> These parties have the same ideals as European Greens. However, they do not cooperate with the Global Greens or European Greens, but instead form a combined parliamentary group with the Party of the European Left, which unites communists and post-communists. There is one exception, in 2004 the MEP for Danish Socialist People's Party has left the Nordic Green Left parliamentary group and has joined the Green parliamentary group in the European parliament. The Socialist People's Party is currently an observer at the European Green Party and the Global Greens. Outside of Scandinavia, in 2004, Latvia became the first country in the world to have a Green politician become Head of Government, but in 2006 the Green Party received only 16.71 percent of the vote. In the Estonia 2007 parliamentary elections, the Estonian Greens won 7.1 percent of the vote, and a mandate for six seats in the country's parliament, the Riigikogu. Other significant electoral results for European green parties include Germany's Alliance '90/The Greens in the 2002 federal election and France's Europe Ecology - The Greens in the 2012 legislative election, in which they both won more seats than any other third party. In some countries Greens have found it difficult to win any representation in the national parliament. Three reasons can be found for this. It includes countries with a first past the post electoral system, such as the United Kingdom. However, despite the first past the post system in the United Kingdom, the Green Party of England and Wales won their first seat in the House of Commons when Caroline Lucas won the seat of Brighton Pavilion in 2010. The Scottish Green Party has had success in the devolved Scottish Parliament and the Irish Green Party in Northern Ireland has had success in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly, where the first-past-the-post system is not used. In countries where a party with similar ideals is stronger, such as Norway and Denmark, Green parties tend to perform worse. In some Eastern European countries, like Romania and Poland, Green parties are {{still in the process of}} formation and have therefore not gained enough support. The Green Party of Bulgaria is a part of the left-wing Coalition for Bulgaria, currently in opposition. It has no parliamentary representation but it did supply one Deputy Minister in the government of Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev from 2005 to 2009.|$|E
