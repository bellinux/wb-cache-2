The inhabitants of this colony speak neither English nor German.|$|E
5000|$|The authors Rod Janzen and Max Stanton {{stated in}} their book The Hutterites in North America: [...] "The film ... {{provides}} a very inaccurate portrait of Hutterites". For example, levirate marriage does not exist among Hutterites. People have to dress in a moderate way, when they are at a Hutterite colony. It's only possible for baptized members of the <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> to marry at a colony.|$|E

50|$|Hutterite German (Hutterisch) is an Upper German dialect of the Bavarian {{variety of}} the German language, which is spoken by <b>Hutterite</b> <b>communities</b> in Canada and the United States. Hutterite is also called Tirolean, {{but this is an}} anachronism.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hutterite</b> <b>communities</b> in the United States and Canada speak Hutterite German, an Austro-Bavarian dialect.

50|$|The <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> {{responded by}} abandoning Dakota and moving 17 of the 18 {{existing}} American colonies to the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. With {{the passage of}} laws protecting conscientious objectors, however, some of the Schmiedeleut ultimately returned to the Dakotas beginning in the 1930s, where they built and inhabited new colonies. Some of the abandoned structures from the first wave still stand in South Dakota.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that MHC-related odor {{preferences}} and mate choice are demonstrated by humans. However, the role of MHC in human mate choice has been relatively controversial. One study conducted by Ober et al. examined HLA types from 400 couples in the <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> and found dramatically fewer HLA matches between husbands and wives than expected when considering the social structure of their community. On the other hand, {{there was no evidence}} of MHC-based mate choice in the same study of 200 couples from South Amerindian tribes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two other}} related groups. The Arnoldleut—also {{referred}} to as the Bruderhof Communities or presently, Church Communities International—is a group of more recent origin which, prior to 1990, were accepted by the Dariusleut and Lehrerleut groups {{as a part of the}} <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community.</b> The Schmiedeleut were divided over the issue. One group is called the 'oilers', because of an issue over an oil well. The other is the Prairieleut - Hutterites that lived in separate households rather than in colonies after settling on the American prairies. At the time of immigration the Prairieleut amounted to around 2/3 of the Hutterite immigrants. Most of the Prairieleut eventually united with the Mennonites.|$|E

50|$|Although the Hutterites once spoke Tirolean German, they {{no longer}} do.

It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as 40 mph. The bridge's decking and benches were put in place in 1993 by volunteers and members of the nearby <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> in the hamlet of Rifton.

50|$|A young couple, Havana & Peter (Patricia Arquette & Tate Donovan), rob {{a county}} fair of its daily {{receipts}} and escape to Canada to hide {{out in the}} <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> where Peter was raised. While there, they get married to satisfy the conservative elders in the community. Peter hides their loot in a secret hiding place, but then is {{killed in a car}} wreck. His much younger brother Zeke (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is called upon to replace his brother and marry Havana in a levirate marriage. Zeke already hates Havana because he believes that she influences his elder brother's behavior. She begins looking through everything that was Peter's, and Zeke rightly deduces that Peter hid something from her. He finds the money, along with a newspaper article that mentions Peter as the prime suspect in the robbery. Zeke initially uses the cash to trick his bride into doing housework. Later he shows it to the elders, who deem that it should be returned to its rightful owners. Zeke and Havana (who claims innocence of the source of the money) are sent on a quest back to the US to return the money. During this quest, the two eventually forget their initial animosity and grow protective of each other. When Havana kisses him goodbye, Zeke promises to return and give her a real kiss when he is older.|$|E
40|$|Manganese (Mn) {{and zinc}} (Zn) are {{essential}} divalent cations used by cells as protein cofactors; various human studies and animal models {{have demonstrated the}} importance of Mn and Zn for development. Here we describe an autosomal-recessive disorder in six individuals from the <b>Hutterite</b> <b>community</b> and in an unrelated Egyptian sibpair; the disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, strabismus, cerebellar atrophy, and variable short stature. Exome sequencing in one affected Hutterite individual and the Egyptian family identified the same homozygous variant, c. 112 G>C (p. Gly 38 Arg), affecting a conserved residue of SLC 39 A 8. The affected Hutterite and Egyptian individuals did not share an extended common haplotype, suggesting that the mutation arose independently. SLC 39 A 8 {{is a member of}} the solute carrier gene family known to import Mn, Zn, and other divalent cations across the plasma membrane. Evaluation of these two metal ions in the affected individuals revealed variably low levels of Mn and Zn in blood and elevated levels in urine, indicating renal wasting. Our findings identify a human Mn and Zn transporter deficiency syndrome linked to SLC 39 A 8, providing insight into the roles of Mn and Zn homeostasis in human health and development.

50|$|German {{populations have}} also been persecuted because they were {{perceived}} as lacking proper ties to {{the country in which}} they lived — this includes the persecution of ethnic German Mennonite, Amish and <b>Hutterite</b> <b>communities</b> in the United States, and of Tyrolean Germans in the province of South Tyrol. In the case of the South Tyrol, these hostilities hit the historically German population of an Austrian territory which had been annexed by Italy after World War I.|$|R

As a champion of religious liberty, he was instrumental in preserving and protecting fundamental religious rights of religious minorities, working in quiet and sensitive ways to build bridges of understanding and respect between Old Order communities and the larger world. One of his most enduring accomplishments was his ability to nurture and maintain the trust of leaders and members of Old Order communities.|$|R

50|$|Hutterite German is an Upper German dialect of the Austro-Bavarian {{variety of}} the German language, which is spoken by <b>Hutterite</b> <b>communities</b> in Canada and the United States. Hutterite is spoken in the U.S. states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Its {{speakers}} belong to some Schmiedleit, Lehrerleit, and Dariusleit Hutterite groups, {{but there are also}} speakers among the older generations of Prairieleit (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn to speak Hutterite German before learning English, the standard language of the surrounding areas, in school. Many of these children, though, continue with German Grammar School, in addition to public school, throughout a student's elementary education.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{a second}} Hutterite colony was {{formed as a}} branch of the Upland Hutterite Colony of Letcher, South Dakota, called Elmendorf Christian Community.

5000|$|Starting in 1999 three Hutterite colonies {{separated}} from their original [...] "Leut" [...] affiliation and became independent.

50|$|At age 37, he {{abandoned}} middle-class life. It was then, in 1920, that {{he moved with}} his wife and children to the village of Sannerz in central Germany, and founded the Bruderhof with seven adult members and five children. The community ethic was based on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and sought inspiration from the early Anabaptists. The community experienced both trouble and growth, but by the mid-1920s the Sannerz farm was too small. In 1926, they bought a farm in the Fulda district and established the Rhön Bruderhof. When Arnold discovered that <b>Hutterite</b> <b>communities</b> still existed in North America, he contacted them and engaged in a long period of correspondence. In 1930 he traveled to America and stayed for about a year, visiting all the communities of Hutterian brethren in the United States and Canada. In December of that year, he was commissioned by them as a missionary to Europe.|$|R
