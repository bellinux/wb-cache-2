40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{measurements}} of actual hot water consumption in residential building have been performed. It was established that distribution {{of hot water}} for domestic needs has random character and constitutes non-stationary process. It was proposed for hot water supply systems calculation to employ “rated mode of water consumption”. Rated mode is a simplified mathematical description of entire ordered collection of <b>hourly</b> <b>consumptions</b> anticipated during rated period of hot water supply system operation. Most precise description of water consumption rated mode may be obtained with coefficient of general hourly discontinuity at 98 % coverage. Selection of hot water metering devices for residential house requires that operating {{flow rate of water}} meter should correspond by maximum to residential building water consumption parameters.

40|$|Based on an {{extensive}} dataset containing aggregated <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumption</b> readings of residents during March 2011 and October 2012 in South Ontario, Canada, this paper estimates the energy consumption of circulating pumps of residential swimming pools (CPRSP) non-intrusively, and quantifies {{the impact of}} CPRSP on the power system. The main challenges are that, first, widely used non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) methods are not applicable to this work, due to the low sampling rate {{and the lack of}} the energy consumption pattern of CPRSP; second, temperature-based building energy disaggregation methods are not suitable for this work, as they highly depend on the accurate base load estimation and predefined parameters. To overcome these issues, in this paper, first it is found that, during the pool season, for homes with and without swimming pools, the ratio between their base loads is approximately equal to the ratio between their temperature-dependent energy consumptions, then a novel weighted difference change-point (WDCP) model has been proposed. The advantages of the WDCP model are that, on one hand, it doesn&# 39;t depend on the base load estimation and predefined parameters; on the other hand, it has no requirement on the data sampling rate and the prior information of energy consumption patterns of CPRSP. Based on the WDCP model it is shown that, the average <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumption</b> of CPRSP is 0. 7425 kW, and the minimum and the maximum <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumptions</b> are 0. 5274 kW at 9 : 00 and 0. 9612 kW at 17 : 00, respectively. At the peak hour 19 : 00, July 21, 2011, CPRSP contributes 20. 36 % energy consumption of homes with swimming pools, as well as 8. 48 % peak load of all neighborhoods. As a result, the peak load could be reduced by 8. 48 % if all CPRSP are stopped during the peak hour...|$|R
40|$|Elenia Oy is a forerunner in Finland in {{adopting}} the new {{automatic meter reading}} (AMR). By late 2008 most of Elenia’s customers were equipped with a new meter {{that is capable of}} recording and sending <b>hourly</b> <b>consumption</b> figures. Since then Elenia has been working on ways to utilize this new data. In recent years more attention has been given to network losses. Network losses are one of the largest items of expenditure for distribution system operators (DSO) and as such a good target for cost optimization. In addition the Energy Market Authority is contemplating on possible ways to include network loss costs into the regulation model. 	Network losses are formed whenever electric power is transmitted from a place of production to end-users. The losses are formed mainly in the resistances of lines and transformers which are heated up by the loss energy. There are two kinds of losses: no-load losses and load losses. No-load losses are relatively constant and do not depend on the load. Load losses are proportional to the square of the transferred power. Before the large-scale installation of AMR meters the <b>hourly</b> <b>consumption</b> figures were unobtaina-ble and as a consequence also the amount of losses was uncertain. 	The main goal of this thesis was to develop a usable Excel-based application for predicting hourly network losses. Loss forecasts can be utilized in procurement and hedging of losses. The application is based on <b>hourly</b> <b>consumption</b> figures acquired from the meter data management system (MDMS) and it formulates the predictive models with the use of multiple linear regression analysis. The application has separate regression models for each month and for the whole year. The main predictor variable is temperature and in addition there are calendar-based indicator variables. Separate mod-els are made for two response variables: network losses and network loss percent. 	A forecast was made for January 2013 with the application and the results were compared to the observed values. The results give some promise but also raise questions. In general the loss forecast follows the trend of the hourly losses fairly well but the predicted losses are a bit too high on average with an average error of 2. 1 MWh and mean absolute error of 2. 8 MWh. The mean absolute percent error is 7. 3 %. Some of the magnitude of the errors is attributed to data quality issues in the early 2012 data...|$|E
