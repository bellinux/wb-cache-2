40|$|Although Saudi Arabia {{has made}} great {{progress}} {{in almost all}} aspects of development, the availability of water has remained problematic. It is, therefore, important to study water resources, and also the increasing water demands in Saudi Arabia in general, and in Tihama Asir in particular. Climate is influenced to a limited extent by the relatively high altitude of the mountains, especially where rainfall is concerned, and an annual average between 30 mm and 300 mm is recorded. The rate of evaporation, however, is very high, because of the cloudless sky and high temperatures. Runoff occurs only after torrential and monsoon rain, when the wadis collect floodwaters from their many tributaries. Two hundred dams have been built {{in recent years in}} an attempt to increase underground water recharge, and to provide potable water in sufficient quantity and quality, and to provide for irrigation. The ground water resources, including the shallow aquifers of wadis and the deep aquifers, could be of greater benefit with the modification of their current use. A large number of desalination plants have been constructed along the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf to meet the increasing water demands of Saudi Arabia's increasing population. The utilization of treated sewage effluent should be increased to stop the threat of ground water contamination and to reduce the pressure exerted on available resources. Results indicate that modem irrigation methods reach high levels of average <b>field</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and traditional practices show the highest average levels of energetics performance. Based on water resources and water budget analysis the following recommendations are suggested to the Ministry of Agriculture and Water with regard to water uses in Saudi Arabia and Tihama Asir in particular. - Modernize traditional and intermediate irrigation methods on as many acres as feasible. - Introduce small green-houses on as many private farms as possible. - Develop water resources extension service programmes and training programmes that address fundamental aspects of improving domestic water use, and alternatives to natural and artificial supplies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The shallow aquifer in Northeast Malheur County, Oregon is {{polluted}} with Nitrates at concentrations exceeding federal {{drinking water}} standards. Efforts {{to solve the}} groundwater problems in this area have focused on developing farm management practices that will increase groundwater quality while maintaining agricultural production. Furrow irrigation is the dominant practice for irrigating row crops in this region. One potential way to improve water quality is to increase furrow irrigation performance on a regional scale. In this study a surface irrigation model, SRFR, was linked to a geographic information system (GIS) {{for the purpose of}} evaluating alternate furrow irrigation strategies in Malheur County, Oregon. SRFR is a physically based model that simulates water flow and distribution in irrigated furrows. The model accepts the management parameters that influence the outcome of an irrigation and in return provides measures of water application efficiency, amount of deep percolation, amount of surface run-off, and other performance indicators. The GIS, constructed using ARC/INFO software, contains the spatial data required to run SRFR on individual fields in the region. The data for the GIS were acquired using many different sources and techniques {{in order to meet the}} input resolution required by the irrigation model. The primary goal of this research was to develop a tool for evaluating irrigation practices on a regional scale, accounting for the diversity of physical circumstances and management practices that occur within a complex of several hundred farms. The particular application of this tool was for control of nitrate pollution of groundwater in the vicinity of Ontario, Oregon. The integrated system was used to estimate a base condition irrigation that is representative of current irrigation practices.

Irrigation demand is the quantity of water at the supply source necessary to satisfy crop water requirements, taking into account <b>irrigation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The Utah Lake drainage area was divided into hydrologic subareas and districts to facilitate analysis. The demand, surplus, and deficit quantities for each area was determined. The computations were made using constant mean quantities. Within a given area, the diverted water {{was assumed to be}} applied uniformly to satisfy agricultural crop demands, and the contribution of groundwater was neglected. The quantity of major interest is the surplus or deficit, which has been computed for present and potential future irrigation effiencies taking into account historical diversions and precipitation, and estimated root zone storage. The crop demand is not adequately met in the study area. There is a surplus in the Provo district (29, 000 acre-feet annually), while deficits occur in the Spanish Fork district (69, 000 acre-feet annually) and Northern Juab Valley subarea (38, 000 acre-feet annually). The common pattern is excessive diversions in May and insufficient diversions in July through September. The present mean <b>irrigation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 36 percent in the Utah Lake dra inage area results in an annual deficit of 111, 000 acre-feet, of which 69, 000 acre-feet occurs in Utah Valley.

Reductions in available water will clearly conserve water. The effects on farmer profits, however, vary with the type of crop, type of irrigation and location of the farm.
