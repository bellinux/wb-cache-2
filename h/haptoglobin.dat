5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The <b>haptoglobin</b> Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, {{possibly}} because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood <b>haptoglobin</b> and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein <b>haptoglobin</b> binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of <b>haptoglobin.</b> Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|Nineteen {{female and}} sixteen male {{patients}} who have had their heart valves replaced with Lillehei-Kaster valves were investigated for haemolysis four to 18 months after operation. Investigation included serum lactic dehydrogenase, serum <b>haptoglobins,</b> and urine haemosiderin. Red cells survival, using autologous red cells labelled with 51 Cr, was measured in 12 patients. No patient showed manifest anaemia. The serum lactic dehydrogenase levels were raised in 66 % of the mitral valve patients, 81 % of the aortic valve patients, and in all the double valve patients. The serum <b>haptoglobins</b> were decreased in 66 % of mitral patients, 68 % of aortic valve patients, and in 75 % of the double valve patients. All the 12 patients studied had lower than normal red cell survivals. No correlation {{was found between the}} incidence of haemolysis {{and the size of the}} valve. In isolated mitral valve replacement 66 % showed compensated haemolysis compared with 42 % in Björk-Shiley valves (p less than 0. 05), 85 % in Starr-Edwards valves (composite seat) (p less than 0. 01), and none in frame-mounted irradiated homografts (previous study) (p less than 0. 001) ...|$|R

Additionally, patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, and coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike typical HUS, aHUS {{does not}} follow STEC {{infection}} and is thought to result from one or several genetic mutations that cause chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement. This leads to platelet activation, endothelial cell damage, and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis, damage to multiple organs, and ultimately, death. Early signs of systemic complement-mediated TMA include thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000 or a decrease from baseline of at least 25%) [...] and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, which is characterized by elevated LDH levels, decreased <b>haptoglobin,</b> decreased hemoglobin, and/or the presence of schistocytes.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling <b>haptoglobins.</b> Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|R

At {{the same time he}} was promoted to the position of senior lecturer and became a reader in Biochemical Genetics in 1958. During that time Harris began two new major lines of research. The first in pharmacogenetics was concerned with the genetics and biochemistry of pseudocholinesterase. The second research focus was on gene product analysis, where he used starch gel electrophoresis to explore the genetic diversity of plasma proteins (such as <b>haptoglobins</b> and transferrins).|$|R
40|$|Almost all {{individuals}} (182) belonging to an Amazonian riverine population (Portuchuelo, RO, Brazil) were investigated for ascertaining data on epidemiological aspects of malaria. Thirteen genetic blood polymorphisms were investigated (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Kell, and Duffy systems, <b>haptoglobins,</b> hemoglobins, and the enzymes glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase, phosphoglucomutase, carbonic anhydrase, red cell acid phosphatase, and esterase D). The {{results indicated that}} the Duffy system is associated with susceptibility to malaria, as observed in other endemic areas. Moreover, suggestions also arose indicating that the EsD and Rh loci may be significantly associated with resistance to malaria. If statistical type II errors and sample stratification could be ruled out, hypotheses on the existence of a causal mechanism or an unknown closely linked locus involved in susceptibility to malaria infection may explain the present findings...|$|R
2500|$|Much of the {{resulting}} breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin. [...] The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin. [...] Almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they {{are old enough to}} hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called <b>haptoglobin,</b> which is not excreted by the kidney.|$|E
2500|$|Biopsy of {{affected}} {{lymph nodes}} or organs confirms the diagnosis, although a needle aspiration of an affected lymph node can increase suspicion of the disease. X-rays, ultrasound and bone marrow biopsy reveal other {{locations of the}} cancer. There are now a range of blood tests that can be utilised {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of lymphoma. Flow cytometry detects antibodies linked to tumour cell surface antigens in fluid samples or cell suspensions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) identifies circulating tumour cells based on unique genetic sequences. The canine Lymphoma Blood Test (cLBT) measures multiple circulating biomarkers and utilises a complex algorithm to diagnose lymphoma. This test utilises the acute phase proteins (C-Reactive Protein and <b>Haptoglobin).</b> In combination with basic clinical symptoms, it gives in differential diagnosis the sensitivity 83.5% [...] and specificity 77%. The TK canine cancer panel is an indicator of general neoplastic disease. The stage of the disease is important to treatment and prognosis. Certain blood tests have also been shown to be prognostic.|$|E
2500|$|Atypical HUS (aHUS) {{represents}} 5–10% of HUS {{cases and}} is {{largely due to}} one or several genetic mutations that cause chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement. This results in platelet activation endothelial cell damage, and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), damage to multiple organs, and ultimately death. Early signs of systemic complement-mediated TMA include thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000 or a decrease from baseline of at least 25%) and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, which is characterized by elevated LDH levels, decreased <b>haptoglobin,</b> decreased hemoglobin (the oxygen-containing component of blood), and/or the presence of schistocytes. Despite the use of supportive care, an estimated 33–40% of patients will die or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical manifestation of aHUS, and 65% of patients will die, require dialysis, or have permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI) therapy. Patients who survive the presenting signs and symptoms of aHUS endure a chronic thrombotic and inflammatory state, which puts them at lifelong elevated risk of sudden blood clotting, kidney [...] failure, other severe complications and premature death.|$|E
40|$|Pair-wise genetic {{distances}} {{based on}} six genetic systems (Rh, MNSs, Kidd, Duffy, Diego, and <b>haptoglobins)</b> are presented for seven villages of Makiritare Indians, seven villages of Yanomama Indians, and 12 Indian tribes of Central and South America. It is {{shown that the}} mean genetic distance between Indian villages is 85 - 90 per cent of the distance between tribes. Since in the past, the initial event {{in the formation of}} a new tribe was probably the breaking away of one or several related villages from an established tribe, it is clear that this initial event could have profound consequences for subsequent tribal gene frequencies. By the criterion of changes in gene frequency in polymorphic genetic systems, the maximal rate of evolution in the American Indian has been approximately 100 times more rapid than the mean rate suggested by calculations based on amino acid substitutions in certain polypeptides of a variety of organisms. The above-mentioned findings could account in part for this 100 -fold difference. Some other factors which might diminish the apparent difference between the results of these two types of calculations are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of fucose, sialic acid, and eight acute phase proteins were measured in single specimens from patients with cancer {{in order to}} determine whether the raised {{concentrations of}} protein bound sugars commonly found in cancer correlate with increased concentrations of the acute phase proteins. Strong positive correlations were found only with alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein, alpha 1 -antitrypsin, and <b>haptoglobins.</b> Changes in protein bound sugars and acute phase proteins were also examined in relation to patients' disease states. Serum fucose was raised more often in patients with advanced disease than in those in whom the spread of the tumour was more restricted; increased sialic acid concentrations, however, were found with a similar frequency in both these groups. Combined use of fucose and sialic acid values gave a high degree of marker positivity which could be only slightly improved on by including measurement of acute phase proteins. The combined use of serum fucose and sialic acid concentrations may have value in monitoring patients with cancer: the sialic acid provides an index of the acute phase response and the fucose a measure of the tumour spread...|$|R
40|$|As a hemoprotein, {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) can, in {{the presence}} of H 2 O 2, act as a peroxidase. In red blood cells, this activity is regulated by the reducing environment. For stroma-free Hb this regulation is lost, and the potential for Hb to become a peroxidase is high and further increased by inflammatory cells generating superoxide. The latter can be converted into H 2 O 2 and feed Hb peroxidase activity. <b>Haptoglobins</b> (Hp) bind with extracellular Hb and reportedly weaken Hb peroxidase activity. Here we demonstrate that: (i) Hb peroxidase activity is retained upon binding with Hp; (ii) {{in the presence}} of H 2 O 2, Hb·Hp peroxidase complexes undergo covalent cross-linking; (iii) peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp complexes and aggregates consumes reductants such as ascorbate and nitric oxide; (iv) cross-linked Hb·Hp aggregates are taken up by macrophages at rates exceeding those for noncovalently cross-linked Hb·Hp complexes; (v) the engulfed Hb·Hp aggregates activate superoxide production and induce intracellular oxidative stress (deplete endogenous glutathione and stimulate lipid peroxidation); (vi) Hb·Hp aggregates cause cytotoxicity to macrophages; and (vii) Hb·Hp aggregates are present in septic plasma. Overall, our data suggest that under conditions of severe inflammation and oxidative stress, peroxidase activity of Hb·Hp covalent aggregates may cause macrophage dysfunction and microvascular vasoconstriction, which are commonly seen in severe sepsis and hemolytic diseases...|$|R
2500|$|Clinical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of complement-mediated TMA can include abdominal pain, confusion, fatigue, edema (swelling), nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. [...] aHUS often presents with malaise and fatigue, as well as microangiopathic anemia. However, severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are unusual. [...] Laboratory tests may also reveal low levels of platelets (cells in the blood that aid in clotting), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage), decreased <b>haptoglobin</b> (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells), anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (indicative of kidney dysfunction), and proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury).

Failure of neurologic, cardiac, kidney, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression. For example, approximately 1 in 6 patients with aHUS initially will present with proteinuria or hematuria without acute kidney failure.

40|$|Abstract : Sérologie {{results of}} the 1969 mission in Ammassalik. The aim of this mission was to study {{individuals}} not having been tested before by any previous french or danish expedition (Gessain 1935, Skeller 1950, Tingsgaard 1962). Before {{the departure of the}} mission for Ammassalik in 1969 a list of these individuals, never serologica'lly determined, has been established by the C. R. A.; blood samples have been obtained from 130 individuals. This sample was only made to complete previous work; it is too small to allow any estimation of gene frequencies or any other form of statistic or genetic analysis. Results are given in the rough — phenotypes counting — especially because the necessity of completing an already very important sample made us collect an heterogeneous group of individuals some of which were relatives and the others were not. Definitely we must not look for another explanation to such facts as the high frequency of phenotype AB in our results. Results. Table I gives results concerning red cells typing. We must add that the 130 individuals were all Rhesus positive, Kell negative, vw negative and i positive; no red cells antigènes have been found in the Lewis system. Table II gives results concerning Gm and Inv. systems. The GmB factor corresponds to Gm 25 (described by Blanc et al.) of the international nomenclature. Table III gives results concerning <b>haptoglobins.</b> Hematimetric and cytoche- mical studies have been made on some samples. Hemoglobins have been found all normal.

40|$|For the S 1 A family, only {{sequences}} {{consisting of}} a single protease domain were included. Positions were truncated {{to the structure of}} rat trypsin (PDB 3 TGI), yielding a final alignment of 1470 sequences and 223 positions that includes the digestive enzymes (e. g. trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase), the immune cell proteases (tryptases, chymases, kallikreins, and granzymes), the coagulation enzymes (e. g. thrombin, factor X), the snake venom proteases, and the <b>haptoglobins,</b> non-catalytic members of the family that have evolved to bind free hemoglobin (Kurosky et al., 1980). Sequences were annotated with regard to catalytic specificity through examination of sequence file headers and literature survey, and {{for the purposes of this}} work, were binned into the following categories: “trypsin”, “chymotrypsin”, “kallikreins”, “tryptases”, “chymases”, and “granzymes”. The granzymes were further subdivided into the major types occurring in the alignment: “a”, “k”, “b”, and “m”. All sequences that did not unambiguously fall into these categories were declared “NA ” for not annotated. For the PDZ domain family, the alignment consisted of 240 sequences and 92 positions after truncation to the structure of the third PDZ domain of rat PSD 95 (PDB 1 BE 9). For the PAS family, the alignment consisted of 1104 sequences and 123 positions after truncation to the structure of A. sativa LOV 2 (PDB 2 V 0 W).

Positional conservation: The conservation of an amino acid a at position i in a multiple sequence alignment is defined by Di (a), the divergence (or relative entropy) of the observed frequency of a at i (fi (a)) from the background frequency of a in all proteins (q(a)) (Cover and Thomas, 2006) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{clinical}} settings, the haptoglobulin assay is used {{to screen}} for and monitor intravascular hemolytic anemia.

Conversely, in extravascular hemolysis the reticuloendothelial system, especially splenic monocytes, phagocytose the erythrocytes and hemoglobin is relatively not released into circulation; however, excess hemolysis can release some hemoglobin causing <b>haptoglobin</b> levels to be decreased. Therefore, <b>haptoglobin</b> is not a reliable way to differentiate between intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} HPR with haemoglobin allows TLF-1 binding and uptake via the trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (TbHpHbR). TLF-2 enters trypanosomes {{independently of}} TbHpHbR.

40|$|The hexosamines are a {{class of}} amino sugars in which the {{hydroxyl}} radicle attached to the second carbon atom of the hexose molecule is replaced by an amino group. The most important representatives in man of this class-of compounds are glucosamine and galactosamine. Hexosamines play an important structural role in the body, being present in the ground substance of all connective tissues as components of mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins (Meyer, 1938; Meyer and Rapport, 1951; Consden, Glynn and Stanier, 1953). They {{are present in the}} blood plasma, where the majority of the hexosamine content is covalently bound in protein. In normal individuals hexosamines constitute about 10 % by weight of the total plasma protein and the ratio of glucosamine to galactosamine is approximately 10 to 1. All known glycoproteins contain hexosamines, which thus occur in a, /?, and y-globulins, macroglobulins, fibrinogen, orosomucoid, <b>haptoglobins,</b> and numerous other fractions including the blood-group substances (Putnam), 1965. The level of serum hexosamines is an approximate index of the total serum glycoprotein content (Winzler, 1960). Hexosamine values in serum can readily be estimated by a colorimetric technique first described by Elson and Morgan (1933). Several studies of serum hexosamine levels in normal individuals have been made but many of these were based on small numbers of subjects. In a survey of 80 healthy volunteers (Spiers and Malone, in preparation) we found a mean hexosamine level of 83 - 9 mg. / 100 ml. {{with a standard deviation of}} ± 8 - 4 mg. /lOOml. and a 95 O % range of 67 d 1 - 100 - 7 mg. /lOOml. The serum hexosamine values found were compatible with a curve of normal distribution. Serial studies in normal individuals showed that hexosamine levels remain within narrow limits over periods of many months.
