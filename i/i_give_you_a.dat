Even this knot can be untied... I will free you from your marital ties. After this, {{if you wish to}} complete your Pakeezah, I would be the most happy to do so. This is my request, that Pakeezah on which the fortune of many people depends, and which had the good wishes of so many people, should not be left uncompleted if possible. You have better means. You have box office appeal, and most of all Pakeezah needs you personally... Pakeezah that is like a sinking ship will reach a shore under your care." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose you}} won't {{consider}} yourself quite disgraced, Bella, if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> kiss? Well! And {{how do you}} do, Bella? And how are your Boffins?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are that}} careless, man!" [...] the woman admonished him placidly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lanthorn and all for {{to look after}} your 'orzes properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--yes.... With you again! Isn't it glorious? But, oh! <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> shock. <b>You</b> {{frightened me}} so. Neale, are you well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hundred guineas," [...] {{said the}} innkeeper, {{repressing}} his passion by a mighty effort, [...] "you {{would not be}} satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may {{be called}} a {{compliment}} to your reasonableness. You perhaps remember that <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hint of it the other day at Frascati." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{your eyes}} never be opened?" [...] Mr. Travers began, irritably, then gave it up. [...] "Well, {{so much the}} better then. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> free hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, not if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> famous one--like a real one, with a {{stock and}} barrel?' said Gilbert, anxious {{to be freed}} from the tokens of his ebullition.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} you speak of unappreciated poets, Yoomy," [...] said Babbalanja, [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> piece of my mind?" [...] "Do," [...] said Mohi, {{stroking}} his beard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> {{remember}} how <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> bagful of gold?" [...] says Beppo the Foolish. [...] "Won't {{you remember me}} now in my time of need?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> unwelcome reply, but I must be true, and so regretfully {{refuse the}} honor you do me," [...] she said sorrowfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Clavering, my going--I mean my instant going--is {{a matter}} of which I have not yet thought. I must {{consider}} it before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Lord Comyn,' says she, presently, with a quiver in her voice, 'before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> reply {{you must}} first answer, on your word as a gentleman, what I ask you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' she said, {{with her}} finger on her lips. 'His eyes are closing. He'll be {{conscious}} when he next opens them. Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> leading word to say to him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (exasperated). This is too much. No: I'm dashed if I will. Here, let me go, Julia. (She {{clings to}} him.) Will you come {{without another word}} if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> kiss? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{feeling a}} trifle better now," [...] he said; [...] "still, I {{scarcely}} fancy I {{could get up}} just yet. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little surprise last night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I was,' {{she went}} on; 'but I {{did not expect}} him to be so silly. Hareton, if <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> book, would <b>you</b> take it now? I'll try!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does the {{suspicion}} {{of it but}} occur to you?" [...] laughed Crispin, [...] "and yet twice already have <b>I</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> foretaste of death. Think you I but jested?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{punctual}} as ever," [...] he repeated, {{coming up}} to us. [...] "(How do you do, Pip? Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are here, Pip?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My clouded amber cane {{is in the}} corner," [...] said he. [...] "Take it with you, Perkins. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> free hand. A stripe or two {{may bring}} the young rascal to reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easily enough," [...] was the reply. [...] "Now suppose, my dear, that <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> pretty doll in {{exchange}} for a lock of your hair, and that after you had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it. Could you say that <b>I</b> had not <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> pretty doll?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Gerard," [...] said he, [...] "I cannot {{promise you}} your life, {{for it is}} not our custom, but <b>I</b> can <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> easy death or <b>I</b> can <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> terrible one. Which shall it be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|TARLETON. If <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hundred pound note now to go {{and have}} a good spree with, I wonder would you know how to set about it. Do <b>you</b> ever take <b>a</b> holiday? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Look me {{straight}} in the face, Mr. Lynx, {{and tell me that}} if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> handsome new tail, you will never boast about it or take undue pride in it,' said she.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lift?" [...] he asked. [...] "I have no sale {{until the}} afternoon. I shall {{go to one}} of the galleries. I want to escape from the memory of the last half-hour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Wait a moment,” he said. “Gomez has {{a letter}} for me, and I {{want to read}} it before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> note that I wish you to take back and to hand to Donna Inez.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> {{remember}} how <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> fine gold chain with a diamond pendant?" [...] says Beppo to another. [...] "And won't <b>you</b> lend me <b>a</b> little {{money to help}} me over to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not telling}} the truth!" [...] cried Ralph, indignantly. [...] "It was you who insulted me, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good deal less than you {{deserved}} {{in the shape of}} a whipping for doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Carrie, [...] "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lead, but there's no use in our trying {{who could}} be nicest, because I'd {{certainly}} beat you. I expect you don't often try and it's a girl's business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Macewen,' {{said the}} old man, 'this must be hushed up, if possible. If <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> cheek for this sum, about which they are certain, could you take it on {{yourself}} to let the matter rest?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now, {{after this}} preamble, {{which has been}} so much longer than I meant it to be, how shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{sufficiently}} just conception of the existing Altruria, the actual state from which I come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You may go now,” he said. “A {{dynamite}} outrage must be provoked. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> month. The sittings of the Conference are suspended. Before it reassembles again {{something must}} have happened here, or your connection with us ceases.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I have no ill-feeling towards <b>you</b> at all. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} my mind because I thought it was my duty. If you think I stepped over the limits of--moderation, I am willing and ready to apologise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A record, {{my young}} friend!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I congratulate you, indeed. You {{have been gone}} exactly fifty-five minutes, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> {{hour and a half}} at the least. Our friend Starling was glad to see you, I hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Osborn {{wondered}} dully {{whether this}} was the real ground for his delay, but he said, [...] "Oh, well, {{it does not matter}} now <b>you</b> have arrived. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hint about my object in sending for you, but you don't know all yet." ...|$|R
