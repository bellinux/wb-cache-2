5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

50|$|N. {{scintillans}} is a heterotroph (nonphotosynthetic) that <b>engulfs,</b> <b>by</b> phagocytosis, food {{which includes}} plankton, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, fish eggs, and bacteria. Diatoms are {{often found in}} the vacuoles (internal membrane-bound storage compartments) within these single-celled creatures. These green nonfeeding symbioses can grow photoautotrophically for generations. Diatoms of Thalassiosira have been noted as a favored food source of these organisms.|$|R
40|$|Tri-block {{copolymer}} poloxamers are successfully {{employed for}} reducing adsorption of proteinous molecules onto hydrophobic surfaces, which will {{protect them from}} quick <b>engulfing</b> <b>by</b> macrophages. For sustained systemic circulation of hydrophobic drug carriers, particle surfaces need suitable modification for avoiding phagocytosis and this can be successfully done by poloxamers. They can affect the drug release profile, which makes them a very promising agent for targeted delivery. This review discusses the structure, characteristics and advantages of poloxamers. Poloxamer adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces and adlayer thickness, relative phagocytic uptake and drug release profiles of coated drug loaded particles have been described in detail...|$|R
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{maintained}} {{in the lead}} until lap 25, when he made a pit stop for tyres. He resumed the lead from Rosberg after he too had to pit for new tyres. During this series of pitstops, Sebastian Vettel gained a position by passing Felipe Massa for third place. On lap 34, Max Verstappen retired while in a points-scoring position after his Toro Rosso was <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> smoke. On lap 42, Räikkönen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose. This put Jenson Button briefly into the tenth and final points position but for Sergio Pérez quickly passing the McLaren-Honda driver after a race long battle that begun at the start, for last position.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
50|$|Megavirus {{replication}} stages closely {{follows the}} one already described for Mimivirus. Following rapid <b>engulfing</b> <b>by</b> phagocytosis, and {{the delivery of}} the particle core to the cytoplasm, begins the eclipse phase. A closer examination indicates the presence of cytoplasmic “seeds”, of sizes comparable to the most internal membrane-enclosed core of the Megavirus particle. These seeds then develop in full bloomed virion factory over the following 14 hours. The full course of infection (until the complete lysis of the amoebal cells) takes 17 hours on average, compared to 12 hours for Mimivirus. The average number of released Megavirus particles (i.e. the “burst size”) is about 500, half the thousand released by Mimivirus.|$|R

5|$|Quiriguá {{apparently}} {{retained its}} independence from Copán and continued to flourish {{until the beginning of}} the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a k'atun-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse– it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.|$|E
5|$|The works {{was shut}} down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> several feet of water. It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E

Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When it seems as if Alyx and Gordon are to be <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

5|$|With an {{unconventional}} front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club, making his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956–57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian {{team for the}} 1957–58 tour of South Africa. This {{was the result of}} a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved a flick of the wrist, Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958–59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge. Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1985, one of {{the worst}} {{sporting}} disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> fire. The fire started 40minutes into the club's final game of the 1984–85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986–87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a £1.46million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered {{for the first time and}} increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1–0 to Derby County.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are <b>engulfed</b> <b>by</b> the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of insoluble radiogenic particles at the solid-liquid interface of an advancing solidification front and its significance {{with regard to}} environmental impact are discussed. It is shown that, unlike classical particles, where the most probable behavior is <b>engulfing</b> <b>by</b> the solidification front, radiogenic particles {{are more likely to}} be rejected by the solidification front. Utilizing a simplified physical model, an adaptation of classical theoretical models is performed, where it is shown that, unlike classical particles, for radiogenic particles the mechanism is thermally driven. An analytical expression for the critical velocity of the solidification front for engulfing/rejection to occur is derived. The study could be potentially important to several fields, e. g. in engineering applications where technological processes for the physical removal of radionuclide particles dispersed throughout another substance by inducing solidification could be envisaged, in planetary science where the occurrence of radiogenic concentration could result in the possibility of the eruption of primordial comet/planetoids, or, if specific conditions are suitable, particle ejection may result in an increase in concentration as the front moves, which can translate into the formation of hot spots.
