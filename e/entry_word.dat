5000|$|Today the Romanian {{alphabet}} {{is largely}} phonemic. However, the letters â and î both represent the same close central unrounded vowel [...] Â is used only inside words; î is {{used at the}} beginning {{or the end of}} single words {{and in the middle of}} compound words. Another exception from a completely phonetic writing system is the fact that vowels and their respective semivowels are not distinguished in writing. In dictionaries the distinction is marked by separating the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> into syllables for words containing a hiatus.|$|E
50|$|The reverse word {{dictionary}} is {{a dictionary}} where the word {{entries in the}} dictionary are not alphabetized {{in the same manner}} as a traditional dictionary. For example, A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language and Walker's Rhyming Dictionary are reverse dictionaries, the organization of which is based upon sorting each <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> upon its last letter and the subsequent letters proceeding toward the beginning of that word. Consequently, in these reverse dictionaries all words that have the same suffix appear in order in the dictionary. Such a reverse dictionary would be useful for linguists and poets who might be looking for words ending with a particular suffix, or by an anthropologist or forensics specialist examining a damaged text (e.g. a stone inscription, or a burned document) that had only the final portion of a particular word preserved. Reverse dictionaries of this type have been published for most major alphabetical languages (see numerous examples listed below). By way of contrast, in a standard dictionary words are organized such that words with the same prefix appear in order, since the sorting order is starting with the first letter of the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> and subsequent letters proceeding toward the end of that word.|$|E

50|$|The lexicographic numbers (given in bold {{after the}} <b>entry</b> <b>word)</b> reflect degrees or levels of {{semantic}} distance between Lexical Units within a vocable: Roman numerals mark the highest-level semantic groupings, while Arabic numerals mark the next highest level, and letters indicate {{the lowest level}} distances. The four lexemes grouped under IMPROVEI, for example, {{are considered to be}} closer to each other than to IMPROVEII or IMPROVEIII, because the meanings of each of IMPROVEI.1b and IMPROVEI.2 actually include the meaning of IMPROVEI.1a. IMPROVEI.1a and IMPROVEI.1b are even more closely related because in English there are many pairs of words—specifically, labile or ambitransitive verbs—that are related by the semantic alternation ’P’ ~ ‘cause1 to P’ (as per above, ‘improve’ ~ ‘cause to improve’).|$|E
50|$|Players {{should decide}} on an English {{dictionary}} {{to be used}} during the game. An allowable word must appear as an entry in that dictionary or {{as one of the}} listed inflected forms of an <b>entry</b> <b>word.</b> Words must also use at least two cards. The makers of Quiddler have established several restrictions on the words used in a game. No proper nouns may be used. Capitalized adjectives, such as Iraqi and Scottish, may be used. Prefixes and suffixes by themselves are not allowable words. Words requiring a hyphen for proper spelling, such as ex-wife and twenty-two are also not allowed. The Quiddler rules disallow abbreviations, but do not differentiate between various forms. Players need to decide for themselves (or follow the example of the game dictionary) if they will allow acronym-derived words such as laser and NATO. The rules contain no restrictions on English words with accented letters, such as née, though the deck contains no such letters. Players must also decide for themselves if they will allow shortened word forms such as ad (for advertisement) and math.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the name {{was that it was}} {{originally}} written over a letter as a scribal abbreviation, as a [...] "mark of suspension", shown as a straight line when used with capitals. Thus the commonly used words Anno Domini were frequently abbreviated to Ao Dñi, an elevated terminal with a suspension mark placed over the [...] "n". Such a mark could denote the omission of one letter or several letters. This saved on the expense of the scribe's labour and the cost of vellum and ink. Medieval European charters written in Latin are largely made up of such abbreviated words with suspension marks and other abbreviations; only uncommon words were given in full. The tilde has since been applied to a number of other uses as a diacritic mark or a character in its own right. These are encoded in Unicode at [...] and , and there are additional similar characters for different roles. In lexicography, the latter kind of tilde and the swung dash (⁓) are used in dictionaries to indicate the omission of the <b>entry</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Using a {{collection}} of automation programs called [...] "Eve," [...] Parker has applied his techniques within his dictionary project to digital poetry; he reports posting over 1.3 million poems, aspiring to reach one poem for each of words found in the English language. He refers to these as [...] "graph theoretic poems" [...] since they are generated using graph theory, where [...] "graph" [...] refers to mathematical values that relate words {{to each other in}} a semantic web. He has posted in the thesaurus section of his online dictionary the values used in these algorithms. Genres produced include the following: acrostic, butterfly, cinquain, diamante, ekphrastic, fib or Fibonacci poetry, gnomic poetry, haiku, Kural, limerick, mirror cinquain, nonet, octosyllable, pi, quinzaine, Rondelet, sonnet, tanka, unitoum, waka, simple verse, and xenia epigram. Genres were created by Parker to allow one genre of poem for each letter of the English alphabet, including Yoda, for Y (poetry using the grammar structure of the famous Star Wars character), and Zedd for Z (poems shaped like the letter Z). His poems are didactic in nature, and either define the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> in question, or highlight its antonyms. He has stated plans to expand these to many languages and is experimenting with other poetic forms.|$|E

50|$|As {{pointed out}} in Nielsen 1994, law {{dictionaries}} can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text (a cognitive function) - such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in one language and definitions in another language - these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a new political dispensation in South Africa, bilingual dictionaries have become a necessary part of daily life. The main function of a bilingual dictionary is to provide one or more equivalents in the target language for the entry words in the source language. Not all bilingual dictionaries realize this objective satisfactorily, Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa bilingual dictionaries included. Some bilingual dictionaries in Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa provide one equivalent instead of all equivalents associated with the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> of the source language, especially if Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa is the target language. Not providing all equivalents renders a bilingual dictionary inadequate, because users do not always find what they look for. By focusing on kinship terms in some English-Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa bilingual dictionaries, this article discusses examples of inadequate treatment.

40|$|The Papillon project aims at {{building}} a multilingual pivot dictionary by voluntary contributors in collaboration on the Internet. The project {{started as a}} French-Japanese cooperation.

If the <b>entry</b> (<b>word</b> sense) is a predicate (e. g. : "murder"), the semantic formula describing the entry will represent this predi-cate (e. g. : "murder of the individual X by the individual Y"). However, the number and the position of the ar-guments may vary a lot among languages. For example, there is a position shift in the arguments between the English predicate "X 1 misses Y 1 " and its French equivalent "X 2 manque à Y 2 " with X 1 =Y 2 and Y 1 =X 2.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{constructing}} a dictionary {{for a pair of}} languages from bilingual dictionaries between each of the languages and a third language. Such a method would be useful for language pairs for which wide-coverage bilingual dictionaries are not available, but it suffers from spurious translations caused by the ambiguity of intermediary third-language words. To eliminate spurious translations, the proposed method uses the monolingual corpora of the first and second languages, whose availability is not as limited as that of parallel corpora. Extracting word associations from the corpora of both languages, the method correlates the associated words of an <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> with its translation candidates. It then selects translation candidates that have the highest correlations with a certain percentage or more of the associated words. The method has the following features. It first produces a domain-adapted bilingual dictionary. Second, the resulting bilingual dictionary, which not only provides translations but also associated words supporting each translation, enables contextually based selection of translations. Preliminary experiments using the EDR Japanese-English and LDC Chinese-English dictionaries together with Mainichi Newspaper and Xinhua News Agency corpora demonstrate that the proposed method is viable. The recall and precision could be improved by optimizing the parameters. 1...|$|E
