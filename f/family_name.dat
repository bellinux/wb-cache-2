5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than <b>family</b> <b>name.</b> Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E

5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, {{as indicated by the}} phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children born of two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman kept her own <b>family</b> <b>name</b> (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E

5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one {{must be able to}} prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> in the College's archives, as coats of arms and <b>family</b> <b>name</b> has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} foreign <b>family</b> <b>names</b> in Korean and Japanese genealogies. This paper is {{especially}} {{focused on the}} fact that out of approximately 280 Korean <b>family</b> <b>names,</b> roughly half are of foreign origin, and that out of those foreign <b>family</b> <b>names,</b> the majority trace their beginnings to China. In Japan, the Newly Edited Register of <b>Family</b> <b>Names</b> (新撰姓氏錄), published in 815, records that out of 1, 182 aristocratic clans in the capital and its surroundings, 326 clans - approximately one-third - originated from China and Korea. Does the prevalence of foreign <b>family</b> <b>names</b> reflect migration from China to Korea, and from China and Korea to Japan? Or is it perhaps a result of Korean Sinophilia (慕華思想) and Japanese admiration for Korean and Chinese cultures? Or could there be an entirely distinct explanation? First I discuss premodern Korean and ancient Japanese foreign <b>family</b> <b>names,</b> and then I examine the formation and characteristics of these <b>family</b> <b>names.</b> Next I analyze how migration from China to Korea, as well as from China and Korea to Japan, occurred in their historical contexts. Through these studies, I derive answers to the above-mentioned questions...|$|R
