25|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} exploited by particle detectors to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of electron volts of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is {{deposited in the}} semiconductor material. If the depletion layer {{is large enough to}} catch the whole shower or to stop a <b>heavy</b> <b>particle,</b> a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor that distinguishes different radiation types {{from one another}} is the linear energy transfer (LET), which is {{the rate at which}} the radiation loses energy with distance traveled through the absorber. Low LET species are usually low mass, either photons or electron mass species (β particles, positrons) and interact sparsely along their path through the absorber, leading to isolated regions of reactive radical species. High LET species are usually greater in mass than one electron, for example α particles, and lose energy rapidly resulting in a cluster of ionisation events in close proximity to one another. Consequently, the <b>heavy</b> <b>particle</b> travels a relatively short distance from its origin.|$|E

2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The <b>heavy</b> <b>particle</b> beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> {{immersed in}} a Fermi sea of light fermions, and study {{the interaction between the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> induced by the surrounding light fermions. With the Born-Oppenheimer method, we analytically show that the induced interaction between N <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> vanishes for any N in the limit of high light-fermion density. The induced interaction vanishes even in the unitarity regime. This suggests that the formation of N-body bound states associated with the Efimov effect is suppressed {{in the presence of the}} dense Fermi sea. We ascribe the vanishing induced interaction to the screening effect in the neutral Fermi system. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|In {{a mixture}} of two species of grains of equal size but {{different}} mass, placed in a vertically vibrated shallow box, there is spontaneous segregation. Once the system is at least partly segregated and clusters of the <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> have formed, there are sudden peaks of the horizontal kinetic energy of the <b>heavy</b> <b>particles,</b> that is otherwise small. Together with the energy peaks the clusters rapidly expand and the segregation is partially lost. The process repeats once segregation has taken place again. Depending on the experimental or numerical parameters, the energy bursts can occur either randomly or with some regularity in time. An explanation for these events is provided based {{on the existence of}} a fixed point for an isolated particle bouncing with only vertical motion. The horizontal energy peaks occur when the energy stored in the vertical motion is partly transferred into horizontal energy through a chain reaction of collisions between <b>heavy</b> <b>particles.</b> A necessary condition for the observed regularity of the events is that chain reactions involve most of the <b>heavy</b> <b>particles.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, Physical Review Letters (accepted...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} ways of extracting {{information}} from semi-invisible decays of (new) <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> at hadron colliders, i. e., such <b>heavy</b> <b>particles</b> are assumed to decay into visible/Standard Model (SM) particles and invisible particles. As a con-crete realization, we employ the models with the stable weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. By definition, dark matter is not seen by the detectors, i. e., invisible. Typically, stability of dark mat-ter is ensured by introducing a new (unbroken) symmetry under which the DM is non-trivially charged while the SM particles are uncharged. Also, many new physics models contain other <b>heavier</b> <b>particles</b> which are charged under the same symmetry so that such <b>heavier</b> <b>particles</b> must decay into (invisible) DM particles along with the relevant visible/SM particles. In particular, we study how to determine the masses of DM and heavy parti-cles {{and the nature of}} the above-mentioned DM stabilization symmetries. For this purpose we take three kinematic variables as the main toolkits. We first discuss the distribution of the invariant mass formed by the visible part in the associated decays...|$|R
