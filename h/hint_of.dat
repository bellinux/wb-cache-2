5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} with a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and {{takes on a}} dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury is {{well known}} in culinary circles for being the namesake of a classic English dessert. Shrewsbury cakes (or biscuits) are {{typically}} crisp and brittle creations that may incorporate fruit. They can be small in size for serving several at a time, or large for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> lemon.|$|E

His works are after all only the disjecta membra poetae; full <b>of</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> a great might-have-been. <b>Hints</b> <b>of</b> the keenest and most dramatic appreciation of human action and thought. <b>Hints</b> <b>of</b> an unbounded fancy, playing gracefully in the excess of its strength, with the vastest images, as in that robe of the Scottish Muse, in which ...|$|R

5|$|The female is plumaged {{like the}} male, but is duller {{and has a}} grey head with a {{different}} pattern from the male, though it bears a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains {{about the lack of}} sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 2006 Dave Meltzer {{reported}} that Eaton was hospitalized {{after suffering a}} heart attack. Two days later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement through the Wrestling Observer website saying {{that he did not}} have a heart attack but was diagnosed with high blood pressure with a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> diabetes. Since then, he has suffered with several health issues, especially cardiac problems which have seen him hospitalized on several occasions. In June 2013, Eaton underwent successful surgery to have a pacemaker inserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} on the piano nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. No <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners {{is linked to the}} main house not by long colonnadesas would have been the norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|E

5|$|The sexes {{are similar}} {{although}} the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and {{the white of the}} outer tail feathers has a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> past {{success in}} 1994, all {{was not well}} behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological {{evidence}} from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the mint where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names York as the place of issue—and the moneyer who produced them. Their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns, providing a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are {{compared with those of}} neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art. The evidence of Northumbrian coinage is particularly valuable in the ninth century, when contemporary written evidence all but disappears.|$|E

5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

5|$|The album Nothing was {{released}} in August 2002, selling 6,525 copies during its first week in the US and reaching No.165 on the Billboard 200. With this album, Meshuggah became the first band {{in the history of}} Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200 and also became the first band signed to Nuclear Blast to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine. Meshuggah's previous two releases, 1998's Chaosphere and 1995's Destroy Erase Improve, have sold 38,773 and 30,712 copies to that date, respectively. The CD booklet of Nothing has no liner notes, lyrics, or credits, only a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> one word: ingenting, which is Swedish for nothing. All of this information is available on the CD-ROM. At the end of 2002, the band went on another US tour with Tool and a headlining tour of its own.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E
5|$|The first <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a {{localization}} appeared {{when the}} Agito trademark filed for European territories in September 2013. Later, at TGS 2013, Tabata said that Agito {{would definitely be}} localized, although he refused to clarify whether this meant it would be released in western territories. An official western release was confirmed by Square Enix at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The plan for the international release was to first release Final Fantasy Type-0 HD so players in the west could get accustomed {{to the world and}} characters, then release Agito as a separate experience rather than a parallel release. With its discontinuance in Japan, Agitos western release was consequently cancelled, however it was stated that Type-0 Online was being considered for international release in place of Agito.|$|E
