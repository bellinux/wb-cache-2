Upon this supposition, each country would gain whatever share of the <b>joint</b> <b>saving</b> of labour would otherwise fall to its lot, minus the cost of bringing from the other country the commodity which it imports. This solution is rendered plausible by the circumstance just now mentioned, that the price of the commodity will be higher in the country which imports it, than in the country which exports it, by the amount of the cost of carriage. If linen is sold in England at a higher price than in Germany, by a per-centage equal to the cost of carriage of the linen, it appears obvious that England pays for the carriage of the linen, and Germany, by parity of reason, for that of the cloth.|$|E

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of bone tumors surgical accuracy and precision are of vital importance to achieve an efficient but oncologically safe result. Most procedures in bone tumour surgery require intraop-erative imaging (fluoroscopy) and/or measurements for anatomical orientation and margin control. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS), a GPS-like system in the OR, is a recently developed alternative. CAS was at least clinically equivalent to fluoroscopy use in curettage type treatment while not relying on ionizing radiation use. Arguably it is better in difficult anatomical locations. While there is additional intra-operative set-up time, CAS curettage takes equally as long. CAS {{can be used for}} both simple and complex resection procedures that include some <b>joint</b> <b>saving</b> procedures that would be impossible otherwise. Analysis showed a high number of safe resections, higher than comparative non-CAS studies. CAS allograft shaping (defect reconstruction) showed high accuracy in experimental and clinical studies. This can potentially reduce complications as fractures and shorten rehabiliation times. Better tools can further increase graft creation accuracy as has been demonstrated in the experimental study. Imageless resection and tumor prosthesis placement was helpful in length, joint line and rotation reconstruction. Computer-assisted surgery systems are a relatively new development in orthopaedic oncology. It can be used to reconstruct large defects {{with a high degree of}} accuracy using grafts and/or (custom) prosthesis, enabling more joint salvage surgery and/or increase in patient function. Complete integration of spatial (tool) awareness, advanced imaging possibilities and per-patient reconstructions can potentially completely change the oncological surgical workflow...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal {{bleeding}} is {{the hallmark}} of hemophilia and cannot be fully prevented by prophylactic clotting factor replacement. Recurrent joint bleeding leads to disabling condition called hemophilic arthropathy. Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of hemophilic arthropathy has increased substantially over the past decades, this has not yet resulted in targeted therapies or patient tailored treatment. This thesis aimed at unravelling the pathophysiology further and determining the key factors in inducing blood-induced joint damage might lead to new targets for <b>joint</b> <b>saving</b> therapy. A central role for iron in the pathophysiology of hemophilic arthropathy is demonstrated previously and in hereditary hemochromatosis joint destruction is caused by iron overload. In a literature review both disorders were compared on their clinical and histological characteristics. We showed that the irreversible joint damage in hemophilia results from the devastating combination of iron and inflammation. The harmful effects of iron to all components of the joint are aggravated {{in the presence of a}} pro-inflammatory signal. Clinically, clear variability is observed in the severity of joint damage resulting from a similar number of bleeds. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in iron control, HFE mutations and HMOX 1 polymorphisms, increase iron exposition to the joint and therewith aggravates joint damage after a bleed. However, results from a large cohort study did not support this hypothesis. To improve detection of early joint damage, we investigated the change in biochemical markers upon a joint bleed. We concluded that biochemical markers are sensitive to changes in joint tissue turnover induced by a single bleed, and as such might be useful in monitoring the impact of a joint bleed and in evaluation of treatment of such bleeds. The last part of this thesis focused on potential new treatment modalities for blood-induced joint damage. We demonstrated that in vitro the degenerative process of blood-induced cartilage damage is hierarchically dominated by the pro-inflammatory effect of interleukin (IL) - 1 β, not TNFa. A recombinant human IL- 1 β monoclonal antibody or IL- 1 receptor antagonist protected cartilage from blood-induced damage in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Blocking IL- 1 seems a potential target for therapy. Another approach to limit inflammation is the use of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10. To overcome their limited bioavailability due to a low molecular weight, a fusion protein was constructed. We showed that this IL 4 - 10 fusion protein is able to prevent blood-induced cartilage damage in vitro and in vivo. For patients with advanced joint damage, we demonstrated in a proof of concept open prospective study that joint distraction seems a promising technique to alleviate pain, improve joint function, and induce structural tissue changes. This study is still ongoing, additional data and a longer follow-up are needed. For young patients with severe hemophilic ankle arthropathy not benefitting from conservative therapy joint distraction may be a promising treatment postponing more rigorous surgery like ankle arthrodesis. In conclusion, this thesis further increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of blood-induced arthropathy and laid a foundation for new treatment strategies to prevent or treat hemophilic arthropathy...|$|E

30|$|Within the family, problem {{gambling}} {{is most often}} identified when financial resources fail {{to meet the demands}} of everyday household expenses, and fund gambling activities and gambling debts (Thomas & Jackson, 2004). However, little research has actually examined the impact of gambling on family finances (Grant Kalischuk, 2010; Hodgins & el-Guebaly, 2004; Slade & McConville, 2003). Nevertheless, financial stress, debt, loan default, harassment by creditors, loss of property and lack of financial security are known to be issues for people with gambling problems (Grant Kalischuk, 2010). Particularly distressing for partners, the disclosure of financial problems or bankruptcy, and the loss of <b>joint</b> <b>savings</b> and/or assets to settle debts, can lead to profound disruptions to a family’s lifestyle, sometimes necessitating an increase in paid work by the partner, sale of the family home, and downgrading of established lifestyles and activities (Dickson-Swift et al., 2005; Grant Kalischuk, 2010).

The weekly charge in this establishment for each female patient is three dollars, or twelve shillings English; but no girl employed by any of the corporations is ever excluded for want of the means of payment.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{monograph}} is to integrate and critically evaluate the existing literature {{in the area of}} optimal <b>joint</b> <b>savings</b> population programs. The existing diverse presentations are all seen to be discussions within a unified framework. The central problem is to compare the desirability of alternative inter-temporal sequences of total savings and population sizes. Of critical importance is whether one regards persons as the fundamental moral entities or whether one takes Sidgwick's viewpoint that something good being the result of one's action is the baSic reason for dOing anything. The latter viewpoint is consistent with defining a complete social preference ordering over these alternative sequences. Since part of one's interest is to evaluate the consequences of various ethical beliefs a com­ parative study of several such orderings is presented; in particular the Mill-Wolfe average utilitarian, and Sidgwick-Meade classical utilitarian) formulations. A possible problem with the social preference ordering approach is that the ordering may indicate the desirability of increasing the population size, if this increases the total amount of good, even though people may receive less than the welfare subsistence level of consumption. However, there are other ways of evaluating actions and, if persons are the fundamental moral entities, then perhaps these actions should be evaluated by their implications for the rights of individuals i. e. people Who are currently alive, people who one can predict will exist in the future (e. g...|$|R
