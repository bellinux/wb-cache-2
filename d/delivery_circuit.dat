40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of arterial PCO 2 (PCO 2) currently require blood sampling because the end-tidal PCO 2 (PET,CO 2) of the expired gas often does not accurately reflect the mean alveolar PCO 2 and PaCO 2. Differences between PET,CO 2 and PaCO 2 result from regional inhomogeneities in perfusion and gas exchange. We hypothesized that breathing via a sequential gas <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit</b> would reduce these inhomogeneities sufficiently to allow accurate prediction of PaCO 2 from PET,CO 2. We tested this hypothesis in five healthy middle-aged men by comparing their PET,CO 2 values with PaCO 2 values at various combinations of PET,CO 2 (between 35 and 50 mmHg), PO 2 (between 70 and 300 mmHg), and breathing frequencies (f; between 6 and 24 breaths min− 1). Once each individual {{was in a}} steady state, PaCO 2 was collected in duplicate by consecutive blood samples to assess its repeatability. The difference between PET,CO 2 and average PaCO 2 was 0. 5 ± 1. 7 mmHg (P = 0. 53; 95 % CI − 2. 8, 3. 8 mmHg) whereas the mean {{difference between the two}} {{measurements of}} PaCO 2 was − 0. 1 ± 1. 6 mmHg (95 % CI − 3. 7, 2. 6 mmHg).

40|$|Vacuum interrupters {{occasionally}} show unexpected (late) breakdown after current interruption. As a result, the interrupter conducts briefly, {{carrying a}} high-frequency current {{due to the}} discharge of various (stray) capacitances {{in the vicinity of}} the interrupter. Thanks to the capability of vacuum interrupters to interrupt such high-frequency current, the conduction period is normally very short (normally in the order of 10 µs). In the discussion around the assessment of such late breakdowns (often termed nonsustained disruptive discharges in the standardization literature) regarding the possibility of generation of overvoltage in capacitive circuits, the duration of the conductive period is an important parameter. Experiments were carried out, in which discharges of various single frequencies (72 kHz- 1. 1 MHz) were generated following breakdown (spontaneous breakdowns as well as prestrike) of two commercial vacuum breakers. It is demonstrated that the duration of the discharge depends strongly on the discharge current frequency. At higher frequencies, the duration of the discharge tends to be shorter than at lower frequencies. For practical circuits, allowing simultaneous discharge from various circuit parts, it was observed that the highest frequency component determines the arc duration. Duration of up to 15 µs was observed. This duration is too short to allow significant overvoltages to develop in standard capacitive power <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Spatiotemporal {{control of}} the complex {{chemical}} microenvironment is of great importance to many fields within life science. One way to facilitate such control is to construct <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits,</b> comprising arrays of dispensing outlets, for ions and charged biomolecules based on ionic transistors. This allows for addressability of ionic signals, which opens up for spatiotemporally controlled delivery in a highly complex manner. One class of ionic transistors, the ion bipolar junction transistors (IBJTs), is especially attractive for these applications because these transistors are functional at physiological conditions and have been employed to modulate the delivery of neurotransmitters to regulate signaling in neuronal cells. Further, the first integrated complementary ionic circuits were recently developed {{on the basis of}} these ionic transistors. However, a detailed understanding of the device physics of these transistors is still lacking and hampers further development of components and circuits.

On the basis of the detailed concentration and potential profiles provided by the model, the different modes of operation of the transistor are analyzed as well as the transitions between the different modes. The model correctly predicts the measured threshold voltage, which is explained in terms of membrane potentials. All in all, the results provide the basis for a detailed understanding of IBJT operation.

40|$|Miniature sensor nodes have {{recently}} opened new markets in VLSI design. In {{the continuation of}} Bell's Law, computing systems have been shrunk down to cubic-millimeter scale (e. g. Michigan micro-mote). Especially, since the concept of "Smart Dust" was proposed, rapid advances in low-power wireless sensor nodes are driving the realization of Internet of Things. With unique features such as wireless communication, energy harvesting, hard-to-reach location, and no-invasive and secure placement, the sensor nodes {{have been developed for}} a number of applications such as medical, infrastructure, and surveillance. There are many challenges to realize a miniature sensing system. One of the most critical challenges is the small battery storage capacity. Since the battery size is severely limited, battery storage capacity is also reduced. As a result, low-power circuit design and energy harvesting techniques need to be investigated to allow operation on extremely small power budgets. In miniature sensing systems, there are four different energy flows: 1) energy harvester from a source to a battery, 2) power <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits</b> from a battery to loading circuits, 3) always-on circuits, 4) duty-cycled circuits. Available energy from an energy source changes depending on the environmental condition. Load current also changes considerably due to duty-cycle operation. In this dynamic system, a smart way to optimize an energy harvester and a power converter are required. To minimize average power consumption for longer lifetime, always-on circuits should be designed with lower power than the extremely low system standby power budget. Also, duty-cycled circuits need to be turned off to maintain low standby power. In this dissertation, to satisfy these requirements, circuits such as a constant energy-per-cycle ring oscillator over wide frequency range and a low power maximum power point tracking circuit are discussed.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) {{was measured by}} quantitative phase contrast angiography of the internal carotid and basilar arteries in 18 volunteers (20 – 31 years). In 8 subjects, gases were delivered via a standard non-rebreathing (Hudson mask). In 10 subjects, gases were delivered using a modified “Mapleson A” semiopen anesthetic gas circuit and mouthpiece. All subjects were given 100 % O 2, medical air, and carbogen gas (95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2) delivered at 15 [*]L/min in a random order. Results. The Hudson mask group showed significant increases in CBF in response to increased FiCO 2 compared to air (+ 9. 8 %). A small nonsignificant reduction in CBF (− 2. 4 %) was seen in response to increased inspired concentrations of oxygen (FiO 2). The Mapleson A group showed significantly larger changes in CBF in response to both increased inspired concentrations of carbon dioxide (FiCO 2) (+ 32. 2 %, P< 0. 05) and FiO 2 (− 14. 6 %, P< 0. 01).

The goal of this project is to develop the fundamental concepts, theoretical frameworks and implementation techniques for a self-contained active sensor skin {{in the context of}} highway bridge structural safety monitoring. The proposed sensor skin will be composed of (1) active sensing patches using piezoelectric materials for damage diagnosis, (2) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless data transmission, and (3) embedded planar spirals for contact-less power delivery. The self-contained sensor skin will be designed such that it does not require any embedded batteries nor have any wire connection for power delivery and data transmission. Once data are retrieved at the inspection platform, an innovative damage detection algorithm will identify structural damage without replying on prior reference data. In this paper, preliminary results are presented on building a practical contact-less power delivery system and an on-chip signal generator for active sensors. A prototype of the contact-less power <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit,</b> which consists of a transformer and a AC-to-DC converter/regulator, is built using discrete circuit components. The transformer is composed of a ferrite core which is wound around by a pair of coils. One of the coils is connected to the high voltage power terminal and the other one is connected to the rectifier terminal. Then an AC-to-DC converter/regulator will provide an appropriate voltage level necessary for the operation of the on-chip signal generator.

40|$|Background. Nasal {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is {{a widely}} accepted technique of non-invasive respiratory support in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome {{due to lack of}} lung surfactant. If this approach fails, the next step is often intubation, mechanical ventilation (MV) and intratracheal instillation of clinical lung surfactant. Objective. To investigate whether aerosol delivery of advanced synthetic lung surfactant, consisting of peptide mimics of surfactant proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C) and synthetic lipids, during nCPAP improves lung function in surfactant-deficient rabbits. Methods. Experimental synthetic lung surfactants were produced by formulating 3 % Super Mini-B peptide (SMB surfactant), a highly surface active SP-B mimic, and a combination of 1. 5 % SMB and 1. 5 % of the SP-C mimic SP-Css ion-lock 1 (BC surfactant), with a synthetic lipid mixture. After testing aerosol generation using a vibrating membrane nebulizer and aerosol conditioning (particle size, surfactant composition and surface activity), we investigated the effects of aerosol delivery of synthetic SMB and BC surfactant preparations on oxygenation and lung compliance in saline-lavaged, surfactant-deficient rabbits, supported with either nCPAP or MV. Results. Particle size distribution of the surfactant aerosols was within the 1 – 3 µm distribution range and surfactant activity was not affected by aerosolization. At a dose equivalent to clinical surfactant therapy in premature infants (100 mg/kg), aerosol delivery of both synthetic surfactant preparations led to a quick and clinically relevant improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance in the rabbits. Lung function recovered to a greater extent in rabbits supported with MV than with nCPAP. BC surfactant outperformed SMB surfactant in improving lung function and was associated with higher phospholipid values in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; these findings were irrespective of the type of ventilatory support (nCPAP or MV) used. Conclusions. Aerosol delivery of synthetic lung surfactant with a combination of highly active second generation SP-B and SP-C mimics was effective as a therapeutic approach towards relieving surfactant deficiency in spontaneously breathing rabbits supported with nCPAP. To obtain similar results with nCPAP as with intratracheal instillation, higher dosage of synthetic surfactant and reduction of its retention by the <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit</b> will be needed to increase the lung dose...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an approach piloted in the Kasserine region of Tunisia {{to increase the}} energy efficiency {{of the distribution of}} vaccines and temperature sensitive drugs. The objectives of an approach, known as the ‘net zero energy’ (NZE) supply chain were demonstrated within the first year of operation. The existing distribution system was modified to store vaccines and medicines in the same buildings and to transport them according to pre-scheduled and optimized <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits.</b> Electric utility vehicles, dedicated to the integrated delivery of vaccines and medicines, improved the regularity and reliability of the supply chains. Solar energy, linked to the electricity grid at regional and district stores, supplied over 100 % of consumption meeting all energy needs for storage, cooling and transportation. Significant benefits to the quality and costs of distribution were demonstrated. Supply trips were scheduled, integrated and reliable, energy consumption was reduced, the recurrent cost of electricity was eliminated and the release of carbon to the atmosphere was reduced. Although the initial capital cost of scaling up implementation of NZE remain high today, commercial forecasts predict cost reduction for solar energy and electric vehicles that may permit a step-wise implementation over the next 7 – 10 years. Efficiency in the use of energy and in the deployment of transport is already a critical component of distribution logistics in both private and public sectors of industrialized countries. The NZE approach has an intensified rationale in countries where energy costs threaten the maintenance of public health services in areas of low population density. In these countries where the mobility of health personnel and timely arrival of supplies is at risk, NZE has the potential to reduce energy costs and release recurrent budget to other needs of service delivery while also improving the supply chain...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{electronics}} has {{revolutionized the}} way information is processed {{and stored in}} our society. In health care and in biology it is {{of great interest to}} utilize technology to regulate physiology and to control the signaling pathways. Therefore, the coupling of electronic signals to biological functions is of great importance to many fields within the life sciences. In addition to the conventional inorganic electronics, a new branch of electronics based on organic materials has emerged during the last three decades. Some of these organic materials are very attractive for interacting with living systems since they are soft, flexible and have benevolent chemical properties. This thesis is focused on the development of ionic circuits for transduction of electronic signals into biological stimuli. By developing such an intermediate system technology between traditional electronics and biology, signals with chemical specificity may be controlled and addressed electronically. First, a technology is described that enables direct conversion of electronic signals into ionic ones by the use biocompatible conductive polymer electrodes. The ionic bio-signals are transported in lateral channel configurations on plastic chips and precise spatiotemporal delivery of neurotransmitter, to regulate signaling in cultured neuronal cells, is demonstrated. Then, in order to achieve more advanced ionic circuit functionality, ion bipolar junction transistors were developed. These ion transistors comprise three terminals, in which a small ion current through one terminal modulates a larger ion current between the other two terminals. The devices are functional at physiological salt concentrations and are utilized to modulate neurotransmitter delivery to control Ca 2 + signaling in neuronal cells. Finally, by integrating two types of transistors into the same chip, complementary NOT and NAND ion logic gates were realized for the first time. Together, the findings presented in this thesis lay the groundwork for more complex ionic circuits, such as matrix addressable <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits,</b> in which dispensing of chemical and biological signals can be directed at high spatiotemporal resolution...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{initiated}} {{by the need to}} develop a stable low vibration engine with a high power to weight ratio. A new rotary (Wankel) engine was chosen to meet these requirements. A further operating criterion was that the engine was required to use JP 8 (aviation fuel). The difficulty created by the use of JP 8 is that its combustion temperature is higher than other conventional fuels, and preheating is necessary, {{especially in the case of}} cold start. Thus, the question posed was, could a more appropriate and efficient method of fuel delivery be devised? This thesis presents the design and construction of a fluid spray visualisation system for investigating the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of fuel sprays using low injection pressure up to 10 bar (1 MPa). Laser imaging techniques have been used for data acquisition. The thesis has been divided into several aspects. Firstly, a background study of fluid sprays and fuel injection strategies was carried out. This has centred on the relationship between droplet size and the combustion process. It further investigated what differentiated the fuel delivery approach to Wankle from that to other engines. Secondly, two families of fuel injector were tested and evaluated within the optical engineering laboratory using deionised water (DI) water for safety reasons. The first family involved conventional gasoline injectors with several nozzle arrangements. The second family involved medical nebulisers with several nozzle diameters. The evaluation of the fuel injectors required developing a fluid <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit,</b> and a specific ECU (Electronic Control Unit) for controlling pulse delivery and imaging instrument. The company associated with the project then set up a test cell for performing experiments on JP 8 fuel. The initial global visualisation of the jet spray was made using a conventional digital camera. This gave a measurement of the spray angle and penetration length. However, as the study moved to the more precise determination of the fuel spray particulate size, a specialised Nd:YAG laser based diagnostic was created combined with a long range diffraction limited microscope. Microscopic characterisation of the fuel sprays was carried out using a backlight shadowgraph method. The microscopic shadowgraphy method was applied successfully to resolve droplets larger than 4 microns in diameter. The spray development process during an individual fuel injection cycle was investigated, presenting the frequency response effect of electronic fuel injectors (EFI) on the spray characteristics when operating at high injection frequencies (0. 25 -­‐ 3. 3 kHz). The velocity distribution during the different stages of an injection cycle was investigated using PIV. The influence of the injection pressure on the spray pattern and droplet size was also presented. Novel fluid atomisation systems were investigated for the capability of generating an optimum particulate distribution under low pressure. Finally, it was found that a new electronic medical nebuliser (micro-­‐dispenser) could be used to deliver the fuel supply with the relevant particle size distribution at low flow rate and high injection frequency. However, as yet it has not been possible to apply this approach to the engine; it is hoped that it will yield a more efficient method of cold starting the engine. The characteristics of this atomiser can be applied to provide a controllable fuel supply approach for all rotary engines to improve their fuel efficiency. The second part of this research discusses the droplets-­‐light interaction using Mie scattering for fluid droplets smaller than the microscope visualisation limit (4 microns). Mie scattering theory was implemented into Three-­‐Components Particle Image Velocimetry (3 C-­‐ PIV) tests to address a number of problems associated with flow seeding using oil smoke. Mie curves were used to generate the scattering profile of the oil sub-­‐micron droplets, and therefore the scattering efficiency can be calculated at different angles of observation. The results were used in jet flow PIV system for the determination of the optimum position of the two cameras to generate balanced brightness between the images pairs. The brightness balance between images is important for improving the correlation quality in the PIV calculations. The scattering efficiency and the correlation quality were investigated for different seeding materials and using different interrogation window sizes...|$|E
40|$|The global aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess retinal {{vascular}} reactivity in glaucoma patients using a standardised hypercapnic stimulus. There is a suggestion of disturbance in the regulation of retinal and optic nerve head (ONH) hemodynamics in patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), {{although much of the}} work to-date has either been equivocal or speculative. Previous studies have used non-standardised hypercapnic stimuli to assess vascular reactivity. To explain, hypercapnia induces hyperventilation which disturbs arterial oxygen concentration, an effect that varies between individuals resulting in the non-standardised provocation of vascular reactivity. Therefore, a normoxic hypercapnic provocation was developed to avoid additional and potentially uncontrolled vasoconstriction in what is thought to be a vasospastic disease. The development of a safe, sustained and stable normoxic hypercapnic stimulus was essential for the assessment of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity so that repeated hemodynamic measurements could be obtained. Furthermore, most techniques used to measure vascular reactivity do not comprehensively assess retinal hemodynamics, in terms of the simultaneous measurement of vessel diameter and blood velocity in order to calculate flow. In this respect, this study utilized a technique that quantitatively assesses retinal blood flow and vascular reactivity of the major arterioles in close proximity to the ONH. The stimulus and vascular reactivity quantification technique was validated in healthy controls and then was clinically applied in patients with POAG. Newly diagnosed patients with untreated POAG (uPOAG) were recruited in order to avoid any confounding pharmacological effects and patients with progressive POAG (pPOAG) were also selected since they are thought to likely manifest vascular dysregulation. Finally, the results of the functional vascular reactivity assessment were compared to those of systemic biochemical markers of endothelial function in patients with untreated and progressive POAG and in healthy controls. Overall summary A safe, sustained, stable and repeatable normoxic hypercapnic stimulus was developed, evaluated and validated. In terms of the physiology of retinal vascular regulation, the percent magnitude of vascular reactivity of the arterioles and capillaries was found to be comparable in terms of flow. The new stimulus was successfully applied in POAG and in healthy controls to assess vascular reactivity and was also compared to plasma levels of ET- 1 and cGMP. In terms of the patho-physiology of POAG, the study revealed a clear impairment of vascular reactivity in the uPOAG and pPOAG groups. There were reduced levels of plasma ET- 1 in the uPOAG and ntPOAG groups. In addition, treatment with Dorzolamide improved vascular reactivity in the ntPOAG group {{in the absence of any}} change in the expression of plasma ET- 1 or cGMP. Future work will address this apparent contradiction between the outcome of the functional vascular reactivity assessment and the biochemical markers of endothelial function in newly diagnosed POAG patients treated with Dorzolamide. Aims of chapters 	Chapter 3 : To determine the effect of hypercapnia on retinal capillary blood flow in the macula and ONH using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) in young healthy subjects. 	Chapter 4 : To describe a new manual methodology that permits the comprehensive assessment of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity in response to a sustained and stable hypercapnic stimulus. The secondary aim was to determine the magnitude of the vascular reactivity response of the retinal arterioles to hypercapnic provocation in young healthy subjects. 	Chapter 5 : To compare the magnitude of vascular reactivity of the retinal arterioles in terms of percentage change of flow to that of the retinal capillaries using a novel automated standardized methodology to provoke normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia. 	Chapter 6 : To determine the magnitude of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity to normoxic hypercapnia in patients with untreated POAG (uPOAG), progressive POAG (pPOAG) and controls. The secondary aim was to determine retinal vascular reactivity in newly treated POAG (ntPOAG, i. e. after treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide, twice daily for 2 weeks). 	Chapter 7 : To compare plasma endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) between groups of patients with untreated primary open angle glaucoma (uPOAG), progressive POAG (pPOAG), newly treated POAG (ntPOAG) and controls. The effect of normoxic hypercapnia on plasma ET- 1 and cGMP was also assessed. The functional measures of retinal blood flow and vascular reactivity were correlated with systemic biochemical markers of endothelial function. Methods Chapters 3, 4 and 5 were conducted on young healthy control subjects, where as Chapters 6 and 7 were conducted on patients with glaucoma and healthy controls. 	Chapter 3 : Subjects breathed unrestricted air for 15 minutes (baseline) via a sequential gas <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit</b> and then the fractional (percent) end-tidal concentration of CO 2 (FETCO 2) was manually raised for 15 minutes by adding a low flow of CO 2 to the inspired air. For the last 15 minutes, FETCO 2 was returned to baseline values to establish a recovery period. Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (HRF) images centered on both the ONH and the macula were acquired during each phase. 	Chapter 4 : Subjects breathed air via a sequential gas <b>delivery</b> <b>circuit</b> for 15 minutes and the air flow was then manually decreased so that subjects inspired gases from the rebreathing reservoir until a stable 10 - 15 % increase in FETCO 2 concentration was achieved for 20 minutes. Air flow rate was then manually elevated so that subjects breathed primarily from the fresh gas reservoir to return FETCO 2 back to baseline for the last 15 minutes. Retinal arteriolar hemodynamics was assessed using the Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter (CLBF) during all three breathing phases. 	Chapter 5 : Normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia was induced using an automated gas flow controller (RespirActTM, Thornhill Research Inc. Toronto, Canada). Subjects breathed air with PETCO 2 normalized at 38 mmHg. An increase in PETCO 2 of 15 % above baseline, whilst maintaining normoxia, was then implemented for 20 minutes and then PETCO 2 was returned to baseline conditions for 10 minutes. Retinal and ONH hemodynamic measurements were performed using the CLBF and HRF in random order across sessions. 	Chapter 6 : Retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity was assessed in patients with uPOAG, pPOAG (defined by the occurrence of optic disc hemorrhage within the past 24 months) and controls during normoxic hypercapnia. Using the automated gas flow controller, patients breathed air for 10 mins and PETCO 2 was maintained at 38 mmHg. Following this normoxic hypercapnia (a 15 % increase in PETCO 2 while PETO 2 was maintained at resting levels) was induced for 15 mins and then for the last 10 mins PETCO 2 was returned to baseline (post-hypercapnia) to establish recovery blood flow values. Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow was assessed using the CLBF in both patient groups and controls. A similar paradigm was repeated in the newly treated POAG group (ntPOAG, i. e. after treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide, twice daily for 2 weeks). 	Chapter 7 : Blood samples were collected from the cubital vein of all participants (uPOAG, pPOAG, ntPOAG and controls) during baseline conditions (PETCO 2 = 38 mmHg) and then during normoxic hypercapnia (i. e. a 15 % increase in PETCO 2 relative to the baseline) using the paradigm described for Chapter 6. ET- 1 and cGMP was assessed using immunoassay. Results 	Chapter 3 : The group mean nasal macula capillary blood flow increased from 127. 17 a. u. (SD 32. 59) at baseline to 151. 22 a. u. (SD 36. 67) during hypercapnia (p= 0. 028), while foveal blood flow increased from 92. 71 a. u. (SD 28. 07) to 107. 39 a. u. (SD 34. 43) (p= 0. 042). There was a concomitant and uncontrolled + 13 % increase in the group mean PETO 2 during the hypercapnic provocation of + 14 % increase in PETCO 2. 	Chapter 4 : Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow increased by 3. 2 % (p= 0. 0045), 26. 4 % (p< 0. 0001) and 34. 9 % (p< 0. 0001), respectively during hypercapnia. There was a stable ¬+ 12 % increase in PETCO 2 during hypercapnia and a concomitant - 6 % decrease in PETO 2. 	Chapter 5 : Using an automated gas flow controller the co-efficient of repeatability (COR) was 5 % of the average PETCO 2 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia. The COR for PETO 2 was 10 % and 7 % of the average PETO 2 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia, respectively. Group mean PETCO 2 increased by approximately + 14. 4 % and there was only a + 4. 3 % increase in PETO 2 during hypercapnia across both study sessions. Retinal arteriolar hemodynamics increased during hypercapnia (p< 0. 001). Similarly, there was an increase in the capillary blood flow of the temporal rim of the ONH (p< 0. 001), nasal macula (p< 0. 001) and foveal areas (p< 0. 006) during hypercapnia. A non-significant trend for capillary blood flow to increase in the macula temporal area (+ 8. 2 %) was noted. In terms of percentage change of blood flow, retinal capillary vascular reactivity (i. e. all 4 analyzed areas = 22. 4 %) was similar to the magnitude of arteriolar (= 24. 9 %) vascular reactivity. 	Chapter 6 : Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and flow did not increase during normoxic hypercapnia in uPOAG compared to controls. Diameter and blood velocity did not change in pPOAG during normoxic hypercapnia but there was a significant increase in blood flow (+ 9. 1 %, p= 0. 030). After treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide for 2 weeks there was a 3 % (p= 0. 040), 19 % (p< 0. 001) and 26 % (p< 0. 001) increase in diameter, velocity and flow, respectively, in the ntPOAG group. Group mean PETCO 2 increased by approximately + 15 % in all the groups and there was only a + 3 % increase in PETO 2 during hypercapnia. 	Chapter 7 : Plasma ET- 1 levels were significantly different across groups at baseline (one way ANOVA; p= 0. 0012) and this was repeated during normoxic hypercapnia (one way ANOVA; p= 0. 0014). ET- 1 levels were lower in uPOAG compared to pPOAG and controls at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). Similarly, ntPOAG group also showed lower ET- 1 levels compared to the pPOAG and controls at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). The cGMP at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia across all groups was not different. In the control group, the change in ET- 1 during normoxic hypercapnia was negatively correlated with change in retinal arteriolar blood flow (r = - 0. 52, p= 0. 04), that is, as the change in ET- 1 reduced, the change in blood flow increased. A weak correlation was noted between change in cGMP during normoxic hypercapnia and the change in arteriolar blood flow (r = + 0. 45, p= 0. 08). Conclusions 	Chapter 3 : Hypercapnia resulted in a quantifiable capillary vascular reactivity response in 2 of the 3 assessed retinal locations (i. e., nasal macula and fovea). There was no vascular reactivity response of the ONH. It is critical to minimise the concomitant change in PETO 2 during hypercapnia in order to obtain robust vascular reactivity responses. 	Chapter 4 : A technique to comprehensively assess vascular reactivity during stable and sustained hypercapnia was described. Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow increased in response to hypercapnia. The vascular reactivity results of this study served as a reference for future studies using the hypercapnic provocation and CLBF. Also, the concomitant change in PETO 2 using the partial rebreathing technique was reduced compared to the manual addition of CO 2 technique described in Chapter 3 but was still greater than optimal. 	Chapter 5 : A new automated gas flow controller was used to induce standardised normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia. The magnitude of vascular reactivity in both retinal arterioles and capillaries in response to the new hypercapnic stimulus was robust compared to the previous stimuli. There was a clear ONH vascular reactivity response in this study, unlike the result attained in Chapter 3. Although theoretically it is predictable that the percent magnitude of vascular reactivity of the arterioles and capillaries should be similar, this is the first study to show that they are indeed comparable. The magnitude of hypercapnia was repeatable and the concomitant change in PETO 2 was minimal and physiologically insignificant. 	Chapter 6 : The normal response of the retinal arterioles and capillaries to normoxic hypercapnia is impaired in both uPOAG and pPOAG compared to controls. Short term treatment with 2 % topical Dorzolamide for two weeks improved retinal vascular reactivity in ntPOAG. However, it is still unclear whether this improvement is a direct effect of Dorzolamide or as a secondary effect of the decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP). 	Chapter 7 : We found a reduction in the plasma ET- 1 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia in the uPOAG and in the ntPOAG groups. This is the first study to show a lower plasma ET- 1 level in uPOAG. The fact that this finding was repeated after 2 weeks treatment with Dorzolamide in the ntPOAG group further validates these results. It also suggests that Dorzolamide treatment does not impact ET- 1 and cGMP measures, although it clearly results in an improvement of vascular reactivity. Correlation results suggest that as the change in ET- 1 reduced during normoxic hypercapnia, the change in blood flow increased in the controls...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundVentilatory muscle {{endurance}} training (VMET) involves increasing {{minute ventilation}} (V˙E) against a low flow resistance at rest {{to simulate the}} hyperpnea of exercise. Ideally, VMET must maintain normocapnia {{over a wide range}} of V˙E. This can be achieved by providing a constant fresh gas flow to a sequential rebreathing circuit. The challenge to make VMET suitable for home use is to provide a source of constant fresh gas flow to the circuit without resorting to compressed gas. MethodsOur VMET circuit was based on a commercial sequential gas <b>delivery</b> breathing <b>circuit</b> (Pulmanex Hi-Ox, Viasys Healthcare, Yorba Linda, CA USA). Airflow was provided either by a small battery-driven aquarium air pump or by the entrainment of air down a pressure gradient created by the recoil of a hanging bellows that was charged during each inhalation. In each case, fresh gas flow was adjusted to be just less than resting V˙E. Eight subjects then breathed from the circuit for three 10 min periods consisting of relaxed breathing, breathing at 20 and then at 40 L/min. We monitored V˙E, end-tidal PCO 2 (PetCO 2) and hemoglobin O 2 saturation (SpO 2). ResultsDuring hyperpnea at 20 and 40 L/min, PetCO 2 did not differ significantly from resting levels with either method of supplying fresh gas. SpO 2 remained greater than 96 % during all tests.

Control heat stress increased internal temperature ∼ 1. 3 °C, which resulted in decreases in, MCA Vmean and calculated CBVC (P < 0. 001 for all variables). During heat stress + clamp conditions internal temperature remained similar to that during the control heat stress condition (P= 0. 31).

New ultra-low power circuit techniques are constantly being proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of electronic circuits. A critical part of these energy conscious systems are the energy processing and power <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits</b> that interface with the energy sources and provide conditioned voltage and current levels to the load circuits. These energy processing circuits must maintain high efficiency and reduce component count for the final solution to be attractive from an energy, size and cost perspective. The {{first part of this}} work focuses on the development of on-chip voltage scalable switched capacitor DC-DC converters in digital CMOS processes. The converters are designed to deliver regulated scalable load voltages from 0. 3 V up to the battery voltage of 1. 2 V for ultra-dynamic voltage scaled systems. The efficiency limiting mechanisms of these on-chip DC-DC converters are analyzed and digital circuit techniques are proposed to tackle these losses. Measurement results from 3 test-chips implemented in 0. 18 pm and 65 nm CMOS processes will be provided. The converters are able to maintain > 75 % efficiency over a wide range of load voltage and power levels while delivering load currents up to 8 mA. An embedded switched capacitor DC-DC converter that acts as the power delivery unit in a 65 nm subthreshold microcontroller system will be described. The remainder of the thesis deals with energy management circuits for battery-less systems. Harvesting ambient vibrational, light or thermal energy holds much promise in realizing the goal of a self-powered system. The second part of the thesis identifies problems with commonly used interface circuits for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters and proposes a rectifier design that gives more than 4 X improvement in output power extracted from the piezoelectric energy harvester. The rectifier designs are demonstrated {{with the help of a}} test-chip built in a 0. 35 pm CMOS process. The inductor used within the rectifier is shared efficiently with a multitude of DC-DC converters in the energy harvesting chip leading to a compact, cost-efficient solution. The DC-DC converters designed as part of a complete power management solution achieve efficiencies of greater than 85 % even in the micro-watt power levels output by the harvester. The final part of the thesis deals with thermal energy harvesters to extract electrical power from body heat. Thermal harvesters in body-worn applications output ultra-low voltages of the order of 10 's of milli-volts. This presents extreme challenges to CMOS circuits that are powered by the harvester. The final part of the thesis presents a new startup technique that allows CMOS circuits to interface directly with and extract power out of thermoelectric generators without the need for an external battery, clock or reference generators. The mechanically assisted startup circuit is demonstrated with the help of a test-chip built in a 0. 35 pm CMOS process and can work from as low as 35 mV. This enables load circuits like processors and radios to operate directly of the thermoelectric generator without the aid of a battery. A complete power management solution is provided that can extract electrical power efficiently from the harvester independent of the input voltage conditions. With the help of closed-loop control techniques, the energy processing circuit is able to maintain efficiency over a wide range of load voltage and process variations. by Yogesh Kumar Ramadass.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and form factor {{are the key}} driving forces in today's power electronics. All power <b>delivery</b> <b>circuits,</b> irrespective {{of the magnitude of}} power, basically consists of power trains, gate drivers and control circuits. Although the control circuits are primarily required for regulation, these circuits can {{play a crucial role in}} achieving high {{efficiency and}}/or minimizing overall system form-factor. In this thesis, power converter circuits, spanning a wide operating range- from nano-watts to watts, are presented while highlighting techniques for using digital control circuits not just for regulation but also to achieve high system efficiency and smaller system form-factor. The first part of the thesis presents a power management unit of an autonomous wireless sensor that sustains itself by harvesting energy from the endo-cochlear potential (EP), the 70 - 100 mV electrochemical potential inside the mammalian inner ear. Due to the anatomical constraints, the total extractable power from the EP is limited to 1. 1 - 6. 3 nW. A low switching frequency boost converter is employed to increase the input voltage to a higher voltage usable by CMOS circuits in the sensor. Ultra-low power digital control circuits with timers help keep the quiescent power of the power management unit down to 544 pW. Further, a charge-pump is used to implement leakage reduction techniques in the sensor. This work demonstrates how digital low power control circuit design can help improve converter efficiency and ensure system sustainability. All circuits have been implemented on a 0. 18 [mu]m CMOS process. The second part of the thesis discusses an energy harvesting architecture that combines energy from multiple energy harvesting sources- photovoltaic, thermoelectric and piezoelectric sources. Digital control circuits that configure the power trains to new efficient system architectures with maximum power point tracking are presented, while using a single inductor to combine energy from the aforementioned energy sources all at the same time. A dual-path architecture for energy harvesting systems is proposed. This provides a peak efficiency improvement of 11 - 13 % over the traditional two stage approach. The system can handle input voltages from 20 mV to 5 V and is also capable of extracting maximum power from individual harvesters all at the same time utilizing a single inductor. A proposed completely digital timebased power monitor is used for achieving maximum power point tracking for the photovoltaic harvester. This has a peak tracking efficiency of 96 %. The peak efficiencies achieved with inductor sharing are 83 %, 58 % and 79 % for photovoltaic boost, thermoelectric boost and piezoelectric buck-boost converters respectively. The switch matrix and the control circuits are implemented on a 0. 35 pm CMOS process. This part of the thesis highlights how digital control circuits can help reconfigure power converter architectures for improving efficiency and reducing form-factors. The last part of the thesis deals with a power management system for an offline 22 W LED driver. In order to reduce the system form factor, Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors capable of high frequency switching have been utilized with a Quasi-Resonant Inverted Buck architecture. A burst mode digital controller has been used to perform dimming control and power factor correction (PFC) for the LED driver. The custom controller and driver IC was implemented in a 0. 35 [mu]m CMOS process. The LED driver achieves a peak efficiency of 90. 6 % and a 0. 96 power factor. Due to the high power level of the driver, the digital controller is primarily used for regulation purposes in this system, although the digital nature of the controller helps remove the passives that would be normally present in analog controllers. In this thesis, apart from regulation, control circuit enabled techniques have been used to improve efficiency and reduce system form factor. Low power design and control for reconfigurable power train architectures help improve the overall power converter efficiency. Digital control circuits have been used to reduce the form factor by enabling inductor sharing in a system with multiple power converters or by removing the compensator passives. by Saurav Bandyopadhyay.

40|$|Stroke, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease {{and spinal}} cord injury may be therapeutically treated with {{neuronal}} replacement strategies which could allow synaptically regulated <b>delivery</b> and <b>circuit</b> replacement. The NT 2 cell line is the only human cell line capable of generating a pure reproducible neuronal population (NT 2 N neurons). I assessed the suitability of NT 2 N neurons for use in therapeutic transplantation. I implanted NT 2 N neurons into murine spinal cords and investigated their phenotypic stability and the patterning, connectivity and myelination of their process outgrowth. The effects of primary CNS cells on NT 2 N phenotype and the functional synaptic properties of NT 2 N neurons were investigated in vitro. The dopaminergic phenotype and manipulatability was examined in vitro and after CNS implantation. I found that grafted NT 2 N neurons fully integrate into spinal cord while maintaining a stable intrinsic phenotype. NT 2 N process outgrowth follows host anatomic patterns, is myelinated by the host, extends for distances 3 ̆e 2 cm, and can grow within spinal nerves. Axonal morphology and synaptophysin expression suggest synaptic contacts between graft and host cells. In vitro, NT 2 N neurons have a manipulatable dopaminergic phenotype which is lost through mechanical disturbance. They form functional GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. Co-culture with primary astrocytes affects NT 2 N morphology, survival, maturation, and synaptic function in a contact-dependent manner. I conclude that graft integration with host tissue is not dependent on neuronal progenitor cells nor {{on the presence of}} transplanted non-neuronal cells. Post-mitotic NT 2 N neurons are capable of phenotypic change as they differentially respond to astrocytes cultured from different CNS regions. This also indicates regional distinctions between CNS astrocytes. The lack of phenotypic effect of the host on implanted NT 2 N neurons appears to be {{due to the lack of}} direct contact between host and graft cells. NT 2 N neurons are similar to primary neurons in synaptogenesis and their survival and maturation requirements for glial support. The selective dopaminergic sensitivity to damage makes them attractive for investigations into dopaminergic phenotype and for Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease therapeutics. They might also be used to develop strategies for {{spinal cord injury}} treatment and to investigate the neurobiology of human neuronal transplants and for studies of neuronal development and neuron/glia interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} a new South Africa in 1994 necessitated various reforms in education, and like in many other countries, {{decentralization}} was imperative in order to address, among other issues, the undemocratic governance practices and inequalities of the former apartheid educational system. This study interrogates the establishment of districts and circuits in Mpumalanga as nodes of service delivery, immediately after South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994. It also focuses on their demise in 2001 {{and the birth of}} regions. The study investigates the rationale behind these processes that took place in Mpumalanga, through posing three main research questions: 1. Which decentralization model(s) informed the formation of districts and circuits in the Mpumalanga Department of Education? 2. What circumstances led to the dismantling of districts and their amalgamation into regions? 3. What has been the effect of this shift on service <b>delivery</b> in <b>circuits</b> and schools? (Did it lead to an improvement or decline in service delivery, education governance in the province, effectiveness and efficiency?) The methodology used in this study is the qualitative framework. The qualitative research approach is appropriate for investigating the rationale behind the shift from the district structure to the regional structure in Mpumalanga, with the Ehlanzeni region as a case study. This phenomenon can be best understood by using a qualitative approach to investigate how those involved conceptualized and experienced the whole process. The data collection method is face-to-face, unstructured, in-depth interviews. The study argues that the shift from districts to regions in Mpumalanga is the result of inadequacies in the district structure which caused districts to fail. These inadequacies filtered down to the performance of roles and responsibilities which led to the demise of districts and their amalgamation into regions, which were given more powers and resources in order to fulfill their mandate. This study uses Samoff’s (1990) decentralization typologies as a lens through which the establishment of districts and circuits, their demise, and the reorganization into regions can be conceptualized. This study found that districts and circuits were established in line with the government’s principle of taking government to the people; in that they were closer to the people they served. Districts and circuits were field offices that were strategically established to assist the province in delivering services to the people as well as encouraging community participation in education. Districts and circuits failed to perform their roles and responsibilities as expected, due to lack of power and authority, resources (physical; human and financial), capacity, coordination and financial support. This led to their restructuring into regions in order to reduce costs, consolidate expertise, provide resources, and grant more powers for them to perform well and achieve efficacy. This study contributes to the body of literature and understanding of the ramifications of decentralization. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.
