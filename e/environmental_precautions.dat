40|$|Currently, the UK has no {{procedure}} for {{the approval of}} novel agricultural practices {{that is based on}} environmental risk management principles. Here, we make a first application of the ‘bow-tie’ risk management approach in agriculture, for assessment of land use changes, in a case study of the introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) sugar beet. There are agronomic and economic benefits, but indirect environmental harm from increased weed control is a hazard. The Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) trials demonstrated reduced broad-leaved weed biomass and seed production at the field scale. The simplest mitigation measure is to leave a proportion of rows unsprayed in each GMHT crop field. Our calculations, based on FSE data, show that a maximum of 2 % of field area left unsprayed is required to mitigate weed seed production and 4 % to mitigate weed biomass production. Tilled margin effects could simply be mitigated by increasing the margin width from 0. 5 to 1. 5  m. Such changes are cheap and simple to implement in farming practices. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of the bow-tie risk management approach and the transparency with which hazards can be addressed.

30|$|Reducing the multi-phonon {{relaxation}} {{rates in}} crystalline hosts {{is accomplished by}} incorporating heavier halides, such as chlorine or bromine, which {{has the effect of}} reducing the maximum phonon energies in the crystal. As a result, electronic states with small energy gaps, corresponding to mid-IR transitions, that are normally quenched in conventional oxide and fluoride hosts will radiate in a chloride host. This effect has been used to build mid-IR rare earth-based solid-state lasers. For example, Pr 3 +:LaCl 3 lasers have produced 5.2 -μm [11] and 7.2 -μm [12] emission. The LaCl 3 host is extremely hygroscopic and offers poor mechanical stability. However, lead salts offer better mechanical stability and moisture resistance and, when created with chlorine or bromine as the halide, also have low phonon energies. For example, a room temperature 4.6 -μm erbium laser using KPb 2 Cl 5 as the crystalline host and no <b>environmental</b> <b>precautions</b> to limit exposure to moisture has been demonstrated [13]. The KPb 2 Cl 5 host has also been used to demonstrate a Dy 3 + 2.43 -μm laser [14 – 16]. The success of infrared lasers using KPb 2 Cl 5 as a host material has motivated further spectroscopic studies of Er 3 +:KPb 2 Cl 5 [17, 18] in addition to other rare earth ions such as Pr 3 +[19, 20] and Nd 3 +[21 – 24]. Activation of mid-infrared transitions of rare earth ions by reducing the phonon energies has been pushed further using KPb 2 Br 5 as a host crystal [25, 26]. This material has even lower phonon energies than KPb 2 Cl 5 because of the substitution of Cl with the heavier Br.|$|E
30|$|Unpolarized {{fluorescence}} spectra between 1, 600 and 5, 500  nm {{were collected}} with a 0.20 -m monochrometer. Fluorescence was induced with laser diodes gated to produce 50 -ms pulses. The diode pump powers were between 0.25 and 2.0  W. A pulse repetition rate of 10  Hz {{was used to}} synchronize a lock-in amplifier that received its input from a photo-detector mounted at the exit slits of the monochrometer. Spectra were collected using three passes - one for the 1, 100 - to 1, 700 -nm range, one for the 1, 550 - to 3, 000 -nm range, {{and one for the}} 3, 000 - to 5, 500 -nm range. An InGaAs photo-detector was used for the 1, 100 - to 1, 700 -nm range. For the other two spectral ranges that covered 1, 550 to 5, 500  nm, a liquid nitrogen-cooled InSb was used for photo-detection. For the 3, 000 - to 5, 500 -nm range, a long pass filter that blocked wavelengths less than 2, 500  nm was in place to eliminate the short wavelength features from appearing in higher order. Also, for spectral acquisition at wavelengths greater than 2, 500  nm, the monochrometer was purged with dry nitrogen gas in order to reduce a strong absorption feature at 4, 300  nm resulting from atmospheric CO 2. Emission was measured with the Tm 3 +:YCl 3 remaining sealed in the fused silica ampoules to prevent degradation from exposure to atmospheric moisture. Fused silica is transparent for the range of emission wavelengths studied. For Tm 3 +:KPb 2 Cl 5, no <b>environmental</b> <b>precautions</b> were used. In each case, the wavelength dependence of the complete light collection and detection system was calibrated using a blackbody source. Spectra were corrected using the system response function obtained from the blackbody calibration. To observe fluorescent decays, the laser diodes were operated in pulsed mode to pump the 3 H 4 level of Tm 3 +, and a digitizing oscilloscope recorded the transient response from the photo-detectors. During fluorescent decay measurements, the monochrometer acted as a filter to isolate emission at wavelengths associated with specific energy levels.|$|E

Against the background of this assumption, a concept for a federal ecosystem research program has been initiated by the Federal Ministry of the Interior in 1978. Cooperating on this project was the Federal Ministry of Research and Agriculture. On this basis, ecosystem research projects have been implemented by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Federal Environmental Ministry, in Berchtesgaden, Munich, Bayreuth, Goettingen and Kiel. The latest joint project of the Federal Environmental Ministry - the Ecosystem Research Project on the Wadden Sea - has been promoted in cooperation with the States of Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony and with the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. The project has been completed in 1999. The completion of these research projects brought up the following questions: Which contribution did the German ecosystem research make to the international discussion on a systems oriented environmental management? In which areas did politics, planning and consultancy profit from the methods and results of ecosystem research and what are the reasons for the current insufficient use of their potentials? Which recommendations can be derived from these experiences for the conceptional organizational and methodological alignment of potential future research projects? The research and development project ''Synopsis of Approaches to Environmental Research - German Contribution of Ecosystem Management'', which has been commissioned by the German Federal Environmental Agency in 2001, was aimed at a clarification of these questions. The project has been implemented in cooperation of Bosch and Partner and the Ecology-Centre in Kiel. It has been completed in March 2003. (orig.)

The change in fish community structure is concomitant with climatic change and increasing fishing effort. Fishery may amplify the effects of climate forcing, and oppose recovery from the impact of climatic events. To characterize the effects of climate and fishery, survey trawl data, temperature data and log book data from the shrimp fishery are analyzed for the period 1980 - 2007. The climate regime shifts in the mid 80 s and 90 s with decline in North Atlantic Oscillation and temperature resulted in abrupt decline in fish abundance, decline in biodiversity and increase in pelagic demersal ratio. The shrimp stock also declined and the response of the shrimp industry was a reduction in effort. As the standardised fishing effort is our only measure of fishing impact it becomes difficult to separate between the two impact factors temperature and fisheries. Yet, preliminary results indicate that the shrimp fishery has minor influence on the fish community. The fish community in the Barents Sea has changed into a more North Sea like pelagic-dominated ecosystem.

40|$|Background {{and setting}} Health care {{has become one}} of the most {{expansive}} activities in contemporary societies, and technology is one of its most influential factors. The modern medical-technological enterprise is however facing unprecedented practical, ethical and epistemic challenges. This thesis arises from a well-founded concern that medicine in general, and individually targeted preventive medicine in particular, may be about to become technified and dehumanised to an extent where its integrity and therapeutic as well as preventive potential may deteriorate. Aims The paramount objective of this project is to contribute to critical reflection and theory building in medicine by performing a systematic documentation, analysis and conceptualisation of possible unacknowledged ethical dilemmas arising from implementation of advancing, preventive, individually targeted medical technology in clinical practice. A secondary aim is to present “sustainable and responsible development” as a potential framework for addressing ethical and practical challenges of this kind. Theory, methods, and material Medicine is a moral enterprise. Thisrenders all medical research and practice basically value-laden activities. The important implications of this fact are currently not fully recognised among medical researchers and clinicians. This thesis represents an integration of five different studies into a theoretical reflection concerning the inevitable and partly neglected value-ladenness of medicine. According to this position and following the tradition of the humanities, the researcher’s frame of references is presented first, indicating the perspectives from where she wants her work to be regarded. The argument departs from the definitions and goals of medicine and comprises six fields of knowledge relevant for a theoretical exploration of the these goals: the concept of ‘health’; the nature of medical knowledge and ‘evidence’; the notion of ‘medical ethics’; the characteristics of medical technology; and finally, the topics ‘professional responsibility’ and ‘sustainable development’. The studies together address three distinct areas of clinical practice: ultrasound screening for chromosomal aberrations in the fetus, cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, and the consultation in primary health care. Results All five studies in this thesis demonstrate that implementation of new, preventive medical technology at the interface between individually and population-oriented care can bring forth important and complex ethical dilemmas and even harmful consequences. The results of the papers can be condensed under the following headings: 1. issues related to the theoretical foundation of contemporary, individually based, preventive medicine; 2. topics inherent to applying evidence-based medicine to individual patients; 3. issues related to practical sustainability and the carrying capacity of the healthcare system; and 4. issues of professional responsibility for both knowledge production and implementation of research findings in clinical practice, – the latter heading representing a meta-perspective. Discussion The results of the five papers are introduced and discussed with reference to teachings and concepts originating from philosophers and medical scholars, such as Martin Heidegger, Hans Jonas, Michel Foucault, Charles Taylor, John Rawls, Arthur Frank, Drew Leder, Ian McWhinney and Eric Cassell. Furthermore, the findings are discussed within a framework that outlines a series of prerequisites for a sustainable and responsible preventive medicine: - A balanced theoretical approach to medical practice implies that a comprehensive body of medical knowledge about the human condition must build upon both the natural sciences and the humanities. - <b>Environmental</b> <b>precaution</b> means, in this context, that potential detrimental side-effects of medical activities must be systematically anticipated, supervised and kept at a minimum. - Equity addresses, in this context, the importance of keeping a sound balance between doctor-initiated, technological preventive activities aiming at ‘population care’ and medical activities that are directed by the expressed problems, concerns or wishes of people seeking care or advice. - Democratic goal-setting, participation and policy integration mean that all relevant stakeholders should be involved in defining, coordinating and evaluating the overall vision, philosophy and strategies of preventive medicine. Preventive recommendations in particular areas need to be harmonised and prioritised in accordance with an overall vision, and the expected impact of new recommendations on clinical practice should be estimated before guidelines are issued. - Planning for the future means, in the current context, that we should remember that our priorities and actions ought to appear justifiable and reasonable, not only from the point of view of evidence-based medicine as it appears here and now, but also as regarded from a more distant or even global perspective, or by the generations that will follow us who are making medical reality today. To achieve this, we need to continuously consider to what extent the scientific questions we ask and the decisions we make as professionals are concordant with what rings true and is important to us as fellow human beings. Key messages and implications The knowledge foundation of modern preventive medicine, targeting individual persons/patients in the context of the traditional clinical encounter, is currently too limited and thus an inadequate basis for clinical action. Ethical deliberation regarding the medical activities explored in this thesis has also been deficient. Despite the medical profession’s explicit intention of doing good, these two fundamental shortcomings imply a potential for inflicting medical harm. This inherent danger imposes the imperative of a paramount responsibility on medical researchers, administrators and practitioners. The practical and ethical impact of technological innovations in preventive medicine should be subjected to systematic and comprehensive analysis. Each particular new technology ought to be evaluated as for its own characteristics and consequences. It should also be measured against the overall goals, means and priorities of preventive medicine. These ought to be clearly defined and made accessible to critical scrutiny and open debate.

40|$|Background: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common orthopaedic operations performed worldwide. Painful osteoarthritis of the hip is the primary indication for THA. Following THA, people have conventionally been provided with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and chairs, and educated to avoid activities that could cause the hip joint to be in a position of flexion over 90 degrees, or adduction or rotation past the midline. These aspects of occupational therapy have been advocated to reduce the risks of prosthesis dislocation. However, the appropriateness of these recommendations has been questioned. Objectives: To assess the effects of provision of assistive devices, education on hip <b>precautions,</b> <b>environmental</b> modifications and training in activities of daily living (ADL) and extended ADL (EADL) for people undergoing THA. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE (1946 to April 2016), EMBASE (1947 to April 2016), the Cochrane Library including CENTRAL (Issue 4 of 12, 2016), Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Economic Evaluations Database (EED), CINAHL, PEDro and CIRRIE from inception to April 2016. In addition we checked Controlled Clinical Trials, Clinicaltrials. gov, the National Institutes of Health Trial Registry, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and the OpenGrey database from inception to April 2016. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of the provision of assistive devices, education on hip <b>precautions,</b> <b>environmental</b> modifications, or training in ADL and EADL for people undergoing THA. The main outcomes of interest were pain, function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), global assessment of treatment success, reoperation rate, hip dislocation and adverse events. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures recognised by Cochrane. We conducted a systematic literature search using several databases and contacted corresponding authors, appraised the evidence using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, analysed the data using a narrative analysis approach (as it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in interventions), and interpreted all outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included three trials with a total of 492 participants who had received 530 THA. The evidence presented with a high risk of performance, detection and reporting bias. One study (81 participants) compared outcomes for participants randomised to the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions versus no provision of hip precautions, equipment or functional restrictions. Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions improved function measured using the Harris Hip Score at 12 month follow-up, or health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by the Short Form- 12 at four week follow-up, compared to not providing this. There were no incidences of hip dislocation or adverse events in either group during the initial 12 postoperative months. The study did not measure pain score, global assessment of treatment success or total adverse events. One study (265 participants; 303 THAs) evaluated the provision of hip precautions with versus without the prescription of postoperative equipment and restrictions to functional activities. Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if perceived satisfaction in the rate of recovery differed in people who were not prescribed postoperative equipment and restrictions (135 / 151 satisfied) compared to those prescribed equipment and restrictions (113 / 152) (risk ratio (RR) 0. 83, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 75 to 0. 93; 265 participants, one trial; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 7). Due to the low quality evidence, we are uncertain if the incidence of hip dislocation differed between participants provided with hip precautions with (1 / 152) compared to without providing equipment or restrictions post-THA (0 / 151) (RR 2. 98, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 72. 59). The study did not measure pain, function, HRQOL, re-operation rates or total adverse events. One study (146 participants) investigated the provision of an enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation service on hospital discharge to promote functional ADL versus a conventional rehabilitation intervention in the community. This study was of very low quality evidence. We were uncertain if the provision of enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation improved function at six months follow-up, when assessed using the Objective and Subjective Functional Capability Index (146 participants, one trial; P > 0. 05; no numerical results provided) compared to conventional rehabilitation. The study did not measure pain score, HRQOL, global assessment of treatment success, hip dislocation, re-operation rate or total adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Very low quality evidence is available from single trials, thus we are uncertain if hip precautions with or without the addition of equipment and functional restrictions are effective in preventing dislocation and improving outcomes after THA. There is also insufficient evidence to support or refute the adoption of a postoperative community rehabilitation programme consisting of functional reintegration and education compared to conventional rehabilitation strategies based on functional outcomes. Further high-quality trials are warranted to assess the outcomes of different occupational therapy interventions both in the short and longer-term for those who undergo THA. An assessment of the impact of such interventions on pain and restriction on personal ADL, EADL and instrumental ADL is needed, and also of functional integration-type interventions rather than just hip precautions, equipment and restrictions...|$|R

Essas sequências (genes) podem provir de qualquer organismo vivo (bactérias, fungos, plantas, animais, protozoários) ou não vivo (vírus). A liberação para plantio e comercialização destes organismos modificados e resistentes a diversas pressões ambientais levantaram o debate sobre a biossegurança destes ao meio ambiente, saúde humana e animal. Neste trabalho foram analisados e discutidos os processos decisórios envolvidos na aprovação de três variedades de milhos transgênicos no Brasil: o Liberty Link tolerante a herbicida, o MON 810 resistente a insetos e o Bt 11 também resistente a insetos. A escolha de analisar o milho e não a soja, se deve ao fato do Brasil ser um dos centros de diversidade dessa planta, e também por sua importância para os povos indígenas e para as comunidades tradicionais. Os estudos apresentados pelas empresas que pleiteavam liberar suas sementes transgênicas foram inadequados, realizados à curto prazo e embasados em métodos estatísticos mal documentados. As amostragens não foram representativas e os números de repetições insuficientes. Estudos sobre os possíveis efeitos destas variedades transgênicas em populações de organismos não-alvo foram realizados de forma inadequada, desprezando a importância ecológica destes. As liberações destas três variedades de milho transgênico no Brasil contrariaram o Artigo 225 da Constituição Federal que afirma que todos têm direito ao meio ambiente em equilíbrio e essencial à sadia qualidade de vida, e que caberia ao Poder Público defende-lo e preservá-lo para as gerações presentes e futuras. As liberações para plantio e comercialização de transgênicos ocorreram por meio de uma comissão cuja maioria dos membros estavam interessados em pesquisas de transgenia com financiamento de multinacionais. Além dos problemas de cunho político, a liberação do milho transgênico feriu três princípios ambientais básicos: da precaução, da sustentabilidade e da responsabilidade por danos. Atualmente diversos estudos atestam problemas na saúde humana, animal e ao meio ambiente decorrentes de organismos transgênicos. Desta forma, a adoção do Princípio da Precaução se fazia {{fundamental}} antes da liberação do milho transgênico no Brasil, para garantir que diante de tantas incertezas científicas o meio ambiente, o pequeno agricultor e a saúde do ser humano e demais animais estariam segurosTransgenic organisms have {{inserted into}} its genome {{one or more}} DNA sequences of a species of interest, to ensure the inserted genic expression. Of these genes. These sequences (genes) may come from any living organismo (bactéria, fungus, plants, animals, protozoan) or nonliving (vírus). The permission for planting and commercialization of these organisms which are modified to resist various environmental pressusres raised the debate about its biosafety {{to the environment and}} to human and animal health. In this research were analyzed and discussed the decision-making processes involved in the approval of three varieties of transgenic corn in Brazil: the Liberty Link herbicide tolerant, insect resistant MON 810 and Bt 11 also resistant to insects. The choice of analyzing corn soybeans, is due the fact that Brazil is one of the centers of diversity of this plant and also for its importance to indigenous tribes and traditional communities. The studies submitted by the companies planning release the transgenic seeds were inadequate perfomed at short notice and grounded in statistical methods poorly documented. The samples were not representative and the number of repetitions insuficiente. Studies on the possible effects of there transgenic varieties on populations of non-target organisms were performed improperly, disregarding its ecological importante. The releases of these three varieties of transgenic com in Brazil contradicted Article 225 of the Federal Constitution which states that everyone has the right to a balanced environment which is essential to a healthy quality of life, and the Government should protect and preserve it for presente and future generations. The permission for planting and sala of transgenics occurred throught a comission in which the majority of members were interested in a transgenic research funded by multinationals. In addition to the political nature of problems, the release of transgenic corn wounded three basic <b>environmental</b> principles: <b>precaution,</b> sustainability and responsibility, for damage. Currently several studies attest problems in human and animal health and in the environment arising from transgenic organisms. Thus, the adoption of the Precautionary Principle should be essential before the release of transgenic corn in Brazil, to ensure that with so many scientific uncertainties the environment small farmers and the health human beings and other animals would be sabe., to ensure that with so many scientific uncertainties, the environment, small farmers and the health of human beings and other animals would be saf...|$|R
