40|$|Introduction: Pilonidal sinus (PNS) is an {{inflammatory}} condition caused by hair penetration into the epidermis. It occurs usually in sacro-coccygeal area. <b>Intermammary</b> pilonidal sinus {{is a very}} rare variant with a few case reports in literature. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight the presentation and management of <b>intermammary</b> pilonidal sinus. Method: A retrospective multicenter case series. Including all cases of <b>intermammary</b> PNS admitted to either of 5 major tertiary hospitals in Kurdistan region of Iraq. Inclusion criteria were any case of <b>intermammary</b> PNS diagnosed by histopathological examination. The data were taken from the medical records and direct interview with the patients. Results: The case series included 12 patients, all case were female. The age range was from 13 to 29. All of cases were obese with body mass index (BMI) ranged between 30. 1 – 32. 2  kg/m 2. All of them presented with discharge for a long time ranging between four weeks to two years. Nine cases (75) were diagnosed preoperatively as cases of infected sebaceous cysts. Resection and direct closure without flap were done for nine (75 %) of them and in other three cases (25 %), the PNS were resected and left for secondary healing. Three of the patients (25 %) developed recurrence. Conclusion: <b>Intermammary</b> PNS occurs in young, obese ladies with large breasts which are kept in tight brassieres.

Additionally, {{the changes in}} end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) were also determined using the EIT data [22 – 24]. The general principle of EIT has been explained elsewhere in detail [25, 26]. Briefly, 16 X-ray translucent electrodes (Blue Sensor BR- 50 -K, Ambu, Denmark) were applied around the patient’s chest in one transverse plane {{at the level of}} the <b>intermammary</b> line. One-minute recordings were made at a scan rate of 13  Hz. The resulting raw EIT images, representing relative impedance changes (ΔZ) in the chest cross section with a spatial resolution of 32  ×  32 image pixels, were calculated using a 30 -s reference period just before M 0. The series of raw images were analyzed offline.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Synmastia is a {{condition}} in which the breasts are conjoint and the natural <b>intermammary</b> sulcus is obliterated. It is the rarest type of breast implant malpositioning during breast augmentation; however, it is the most difficult one to correct. AlloDerm is an acellular dermal matrix that is assuming a major role in immediate breast reconstruction in recent years. Methods: In the past 2 years, we have treated 3 thin women, a total of 6 breasts, for correction of synmastia after bilateral immediate breast reconstruction, using tissue expanders and skin sparing mastectomy. All of them suffered from synmastia, which manifested immediately after the mastectomy and accelerated during tissue expander inflation. We exchanged the expander into silicone implants, and during the same procedure we corrected the synmastia, using an AlloDerm sling. A thick sheet of AlloDerm (Life-Cell Corp, Branchbung, NJ) is used and the AlloDerm sheet is designed into a long narrow sling. Then, the sling is sutured into place. Results: This technique successfully resolved the synmastia. Conclusion: The use of an AlloDerm sling to reinforce the capsule and the AlloDerm incorporation into it ensures a sound solution with a low recurrence rate...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carry out to obtain direct {{evidence}} that the body midline actually is perceived and to assess some psychophysical properties of this line. Twelve normal, right-handed male {{subjects were asked to}} make accurate pointing movements toward the midline of the anterior trunk {{on the basis of their}} mental representation of this line. Each hand was used to point while the head was either aligned with the trunk or tilted 30 degrees to the right or left. Analysis of end-positions of pointing on trunk images acquired by an image analysis system indicated that the trunk midline indeed is perceived as a straight line. Three putative trunk midlines were taken into consideration on the basis of anatomic landmarks, and it was found that the mental representation of the trunk midline came nearest to the line orthogonal to the <b>intermammary</b> line crossing its midpoint. The performing hand and the position of the head relative to the trunk both had an effect on the mental representation of the trunk midline. These findings suggest that somatosensory signals from the trunk, as well as proprioceptive input from the neck, contribute to the elaboration of the subject's mental representation of the trunk midline...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{determination}} of {{the width of the}} implant is the first key step to select shape and volume of the implant in breast augmentation. The aim {{of this study was to}} introduce a new method to determine the width of the implant (W) and explain the reasons to do so in details. Methods: From January 2006 to June 2014, the authors have found and applied "CD − 4 " theory to determine the width of breast implant (W) in dual plane I or II breast augmentation cases through transaxillary or periareolar incision for 560 patients. "CD" is defined as the curved distance on skin from the midline of the sternal bone to the anterior axillary line (AAL) on the lateral chest wall through the horizontal level on inferior mammary fold. W = CD − 4 (or 3. 5) cm. Results: The 560 patients used both round and anatomic implants with W from 10. 5 cm to 12. 5 cm. Their CDs are from 14. 5 cm to 17 cm. About 78 % of the patients have got followed up from 1 month to 5 years postoperatively. Except for four patients who got unilateral capsular contractions, all the other patients are satisfied with their nature new breast shapes and volumes. Their new <b>intermammary</b> cleavages without bras are between 1 cm and 2. 5 cm, and lateral borders of the breast are on the area of the AAL. Conclusions: W (width of the implant) = CD − 4 (cm) when doing dual plan I or II breast augmentation. For the very thin patient, 4 should be 3. 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Today, no {{objective}} criteria exist {{to differentiate between}} individual primary tumors and intra- or <b>intermammary</b> dissemination respectively, in patients diagnosed with two or more synchronous breast cancers. To elucidate whether these tumors most likely arise through clonal expansion, or whether they represent individual primary tumors is of tumor biological interest and may have clinical implications. In this respect, high resolution genomic profiling may provide a more reliable approach than conventional histopathological and tumor biological factors. Methods 32 K tiling microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used to explore the genomic similarities among synchronous unilateral and bilateral invasive breast cancer tumor pairs, and was compared with histopathological and tumor biological parameters. Results Based on global copy number profiles and unsupervised hierarchical clustering, five of ten (p = 1. 9 × 10 - 5) unilateral tumor pairs displayed similar genomic profiles within the pair, while only one of eight bilateral tumor pairs (p = 0. 29) displayed pair-wise genomic similarities. DNA index, histological type and presence of vessel invasion correlated with the genomic analyses. Conclusion Synchronous unilateral tumor pairs are often genomically similar, while synchronous bilateral tumors most often represent individual primary tumors. However, two independent unilateral primary tumors can develop synchronously and contralateral tumor spread can occur. The presence of an intraductal component is not informative when establishing the independence of two tumors, while vessel invasion, the presence of which was found in clustering tumor pairs but not in tumor pairs that did not cluster together, supports the clustering outcome. Our data suggest that genomically similar unilateral tumor pairs may represent a more aggressive disease that requires the addition of more severe treatment modalities, and {{underscores the importance of}} evaluating the clonality of multiple tumors for optimal patient management. In summary, our findings demonstrate the importance of evaluating the properties of both tumors {{in order to determine the}} most optimal patient management. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hormonal {{treatment}} {{might affect}} the immune response to tumor antigens induced in cancer patients who are being vaccinated. 							Case presentation: A 33 years-old woman was diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma in May 2009. Her melanoma was located in the <b>intermammary</b> sulcus, had a Breslow thickness of 4 mm, a Clark’s level IV, it was ulcerated and highly melanotic. The bilateral sentinel node biopsy was negative. She entered into a randomized Phase II/III clinical study comparing a vaccine composed of irradiated melanoma cells plus BCG plus GM-CSF versus IFN-alpha 2 b and she {{was assigned to the}} vaccine arm. During the two years treatment she remained disease-free; the final CAT scan being performed in August 2011. Between November and December 2011, her gynecologist treated her with three cycles of 200 mg progesterone/day for ten days, every two weeks, for ovary dysfunction. In November 2011 the patient returned to the Hospital for clinical and imaging evaluation and no evidence of disease was found. At the next visit in March 2012 an ultrasound revealed multiple, large metastases in the liver. A CAT scan confirmed the presence of liver, adrenal glands and spleen metastases. A needle biopsy of a liver lesion revealed metastatic melanoma of similar characteristics to the original tumor. We suggest that progesterone treatment triggered proliferation of so far dormant micrometastases that were controlled during CSF 470 vaccine treatment. 							Conclusion: The use of progesterone in patients with melanoma that are under immunological treatments should be carefully considered, since progesterone could modify the balance of pro-inflammatory and Th 1 functions to a regulatory and anti-inflammatory profile of the immune system that could have an impact in tumor progression.
