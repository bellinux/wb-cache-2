If Full Matrix Capture (FMC) is used to record inspection data the most appropriate way of doing this is to assess transducer performance on an element by element basis rather than assess a specific beam. The rationale for this approach is that FMC allows any beam to be synthetically produced, including the re-analysis of old inspection data using different beams or imaging algorithms. To take advantage of this flexibility requires a method of probe calibration not coupled with a particular beam. This paper presents the development of a calibration routine based on this philosophy, including the selection of acceptable limits for element performance.

40|$|Earthquake source {{parameters}} underpin {{several aspects}} of nuclear explosion monitoring. Such aspects are: calibration of moment magnitudes (including coda magnitudes) and magnitude and <b>distance</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>corrections</b> (MDAC); source depths; discrimination by isotropic moment tensor components; and waveform modeling for structure (including waveform tomography). This project seeks to improve methods for and broaden the applicability of estimating source parameters from broadband waveforms using the Cut-and-Paste (CAP) methodology. The CAP method uses a library of Green’s functions for a one-dimensional (1 D, depth-varying) seismic velocity model. The method separates the main arrivals of the regional waveform into 5 windows: Pnl (vertical and radial components), Rayleigh (vertical and radial components) and Love (transverse component). Source parameters are estimated by grid search over strike, dip, rake and depth and seismic moment or equivalently moment magnitude, MW, are adjusted to fit the amplitudes. Key to the CAP method is allowing the synthetic seismograms to shift in time relative to the data in order to account for path-propagation errors (delays) in the 1 D seismic velocity model used to compute the Green’s functions. The CAP method {{has been shown to}} improve estimates of source parameters, especially when delay and amplitude biases are calibrated using high signal-to-noise data from moderate earthquakes, CAP+...|$|R

The calibration process consists {{of a number of}} steps: (1) populating the database with independently identified regional events; (2) developing regional boundaries and pre-identifying severe regional phase blockage zones; (3) measuring and calibrating coda based magnitude scales; (4 a) measuring regional amplitudes and making magnitude and <b>distance</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>corrections</b> (MDAC); (4 b) applying the DOE modified kriging methodology to MDAC results using the regionalized background model; (5) determining the thresholds of detectability of regional phases as a function of phase type and frequency; (6) evaluating regional phase discriminant performance both singly and in combination; (7) combining steps 1 - 6 to create a calibrated discrimination surface for each stations; (8) assessing progress and iterating. We have now developed this calibration procedure {{to the point where it}} is fairly straightforward to apply earthquake-explosion discrimination in regions with ample empirical data. Several of the steps outlined above are discussed in greater detail in other DOE papers in this volume or in recent publications. Here we emphasize the results of the above process: station correction surfaces and their improvement to discrimination results compared with simpler calibration methods. Some of the outstanding discrimination research issues involve cases in which there is little or no empirical data. For example in many cases there is no regional nuclear explosion data at IMS stations or nearby surrogates. We have taken two approaches to this problem, first finding and using mining explosion data when available, and second using test-site based models to transport earthquake-explosion discrimination behavior to new regions. Finally an important component of our research is assessing improvement in the ability to discriminate events. By combining the multivariate discriminants with the threshold detection curves for the regional seismic phases used in those discriminants, we have started to make maps of the probability an event will be identified properly. These maps serve a broad range of purposes from demonstrating progress to funding agencies to prioritizing {{research and}} calibration efforts...|$|R

Corrected amplitudes {{can be used in}} ratios to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. However, source effects remain that cannot easily be determined and applied as amplitude cor-rections, such as those due to depth, focal mechanism, local material property, and apparent stress variability. We develop a mathematical model to capture these near-source effects as random (unknown), giving an error partition of three sources: model inadequacy, station noise, and amplitude correlation. This mathematical model is the basis for a general multistation regional discriminant formulation. The standard error of the discriminant includes the variances of model inadequacy and station noise, along with amplitude correlation in its formulation. The developed methods are demonstrated for a collection of Nevada test site (NTS) events observed at regional stations (see Fig. 1). Importantly, the proposed formulation includes all corrected am-plitude information through the construction of multistation discriminants. In contrast, previous studies have only computed discriminants from single stations having both P and S amplitudes.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years there have been several large (Mw> 7. 0) {{earthquakes}} in the eastern Mediterranean region (Gulf of Aqaba, Racha, Adana, etc.), many of which have had aftershock deployments by local seismological organizations. In addition to providing ground truth data (GT << 5 km) that is used in regional location calibration and validation, the waveform data can be used to aid in calibrating regional magnitudes, seismic discriminants, and velocity structure. For small regional events (mb << 4. 5), a stable, accurate magnitude is essential in the development of realistic detection threshold curves, proper magnitude and <b>distance</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>correction</b> processing, formation of an M s:mb discriminant, and accurate yield determination of clandestine nuclear explosions. Our approach provides a stable source spectra from which Mw and mb can be obtained without regional magnitude biases. Once calibration corrections are obtained for earthquakes, the coda-derived source spectra exhibit strong depth-dependent spectral peaking when the same corrections are applied to explosions at the Nevada Test Site (Mayeda and Walter, 1996), chemical explosions in the recent “Depth of Burial ” experiment in Kazahkstan (Myers et al., 1999), and the recent nuclear test in India.

Our current focus is on Pn, an extremely important phase in seismic event identification. Accurately accounting for regional-phase geometric spreading is critical for the development of useful attenuation models. It is particularly important for Pn and Sn waves because the propagation mode of these waves makes them more susceptible to upper mantle velocity structures and the Earth’s sphericity, which in turn causes the geometric spreading of Pn (and Sn) to be dependent on frequency as well as on range in a complicated way. We conduct numerical simulations to quantify Pn and Sn geometric spreading in a spherical Earth model with constant mantle velocities.

Large events (approximately mb> 4. 0) can often be successfully identified by the MS:mb discriminant. In order to monitor small events (approximately mb < 4. 0) short-period regional waveform data recorded within 2000 km will be needed because of poor signal-to-noise at large distances and/or long-periods.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to improve low-magnitude regional seismic discrimination by performing a thorough investigation of earthquake source scaling using diverse, high-quality datasets from varied tectonic regions. Local-to-regional high-frequency discrimination requires an estimate of how earthquakes scale with size. Walter and Taylor (2002) developed the MDAC (Magnitude and <b>Distance</b> <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Corrections)</b> method to empirically account for these effects through regional calibration. The accuracy of these corrections has a direct impact on our ability to identify clandestine explosions in the broad regional areas characterized by low seismicity. Unfortunately our knowledge of source scaling at small magnitudes (i. e., m{sub b} < {approx} 4. 0) is poorly resolved. It is not clear whether different studies obtain contradictory results because they analyze different earthquakes, or because they use different methods. Even in regions that are well studied, such as test sites or areas of high seismicity, we still rely on empirical scaling relations derived from studies taken from half-way around the world at inter-plate regions. We investigate earthquake sources and scaling from different tectonic settings, comparing direct and coda wave analysis methods. We begin by developing and improving the two different methods, and then in future years we will apply them both to each set of earthquakes. Analysis of locally recorded, direct waves from events is intuitively the simplest way of obtaining accurate source parameters, as these waves have been least affected by travel through the earth. But there are {{only a limited number of}} earthquakes that are recorded locally, by sufficient stations to give good azimuthal coverage, and have very closely located smaller earthquakes that can be used as an empirical Green's function (EGF) to remove path effects. In contrast, coda waves average radiation from all directions so single-station records should be adequate, and previous work suggests that the requirements for the EGF event are much less stringent. We can study more earthquakes using the coda-wave methods, while using direct wave methods for the best recorded subset of events so as to investigate any differences between the results of the two approaches. Finding 'perfect' EGF events for direct wave analysis is difficult, as is ascertaining the quality of a particular EGF event. We develop a multi-taper method to obtain time-domain source-time-functions by frequency division. If an earthquake and EGF event pair are able to produce a clear, time-domain source pulse then we accept the EGF event. We then model the spectral (amplitude) ratio to determine source parameters from both direct P and S waves. We use the well-recorded sequence of aftershocks of the M 5 Au Sable Forks, NY, earthquake to test the method and also to obtain some of the first accurate source parameters for small earthquakes in eastern North America. We find that the stress drops are high, confirming previous work suggesting that intraplate continental earthquakes have higher stress drops than events at plate boundaries. We simplify and improve the coda wave analysis method by calculating spectral ratios between different sized earthquakes. We first compare spectral ratio performance between local and near-regional S and coda waves in the San Francisco Bay region for moderate-sized events. The average spectral ratio standard deviations using coda are {approx} 0. 05 to 0. 12, roughly a factor of 3 smaller than direct S-waves for 0. 2 < f < 15. 0 Hz. Also, direct wave analysis requires collocated pairs of earthquakes whereas the event-pairs (Green's function and target events) can be separated by {approx} 25 km for coda amplitudes without any appreciable degradation. We then apply coda spectral ratio method to the 1999 Hector Mine mainshock (M{sub w} 7. 0, Mojave Desert) and its larger aftershocks. We observe a clear departure from self-similarity, consistent with previous studies using similar regional datasets...|$|R

This project focuses on exploiting this new understanding to improve discrimination of earthquakes and explosions using regional data. The main objective is to develop and test an innovative processing and discrimination procedure, based on robust features of multi-dimensional spectral ratios for regional seismic phases, and using comparisons to source models. In this paper, two-dimensional grids of P/S spectral ratios for all combinations of frequencies of P- and S-wave spectra are shown to exhibit much greater differences in relative spectral amplitudes and shapes between explosions and earthquakes than considered before.

The introduction of <b>amplitude</b> <b>correction,</b> in a regime in which acoustic pres-sures from individual transducer array elements are ad-justed to be normalized at the focus, has demonstrated a 6 % (0. 27 dB) average decrease in acoustic sidelobe acoustic intensity relative to the focal intensity and a 2 % (0. 09 dB) average decrease in the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the acoustic intensity profile at the focus. These improvements {{come at the expense}} of sig-nificant ultrasound intensity loss—as much as 30 % lower (1. 55 dB) —at the focus because the <b>amplitude</b> <b>correction</b> method requires that, at constant power, a larger propor-tion of energy is absorbed or reflected by regions of the skull that transmit less energy.

This technique allows the application of driftless GPSCs to x-ray spectrometry up to 60 keV. Although the pulse throughput achieved by the digital pulse-height analyser in this application is limited to about 2 kHz, total interaction rates above 20 kHz can be tolerated by the detector without significant degradation of the pulse-height distributions obtained.

40|$|RLC {{measuring}} principle based on discrete spectrum analysis is proposed. RLC is abbreviations of resistance, inductance and capacitance. The value of complex impedance is obtained by gathering sinusoidal voltage and sinusoidal current flowing through impedance measuring synchronously and taking FFT to the signal gathered. By researching on {{the source of}} errors in RLC measurement based on the analysis of discrete spectrum, discrete spectrum correction technology which can reduce errors in RLC measurement is proposed. Discrete spectrum correction technology is made of frequency <b>correction,</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>correction</b> and phase correction. The precision of RLC measuring instrument is improved greatly by using ratio formula correction method based on rectangular window...|$|R

The surface condition of the reference block shall {{be representative of the}} surface condition of the part to be examined. Unless otherwise specified the reference block shall contain at least three reflectors covering the entire depth range under examination (Lavender 1976).|$|R
40|$|A local-oscillator phase-shifting {{approach}} is introduced {{to implement a}} fully integrated 24 -GHz phased-array receiver using an SiGe technology. Sixteen phases of the local oscillator are generated in one oscillator core, resulting in a raw beam-forming accuracy of 4 bits. These phases are distributed to all eight receiving paths of the array by a symmetric network. The appropriate phase for each path is selected using high-frequency analog multiplexers. The raw beam-steering resolution of the array is better than 10 [degrees] for a forward-looking angle, while the array spatial selectivity, without any <b>amplitude</b> <b>correction,</b> is better than 20 dB. The overall gain of the array is 61 dB, while the array improves the input signal-to-noise ratio by 9 dB...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{parametric}} process {{occurring in}} a nonlinear planar waveguide {{can serve as}} a source of light with nonclassical properties. Properties of the generated fields are substantially modified by scattering of the nonlinearly interacting fields in a photonic band-gap structure inside the waveguide. A quantum model of linear operator <b>amplitude</b> <b>corrections</b> to <b>amplitude</b> mean-values provides conditions for an efficient squeezed-light generation as well as generation of light with sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics. Destructive influence of phase mismatch of the nonlinear interaction can fully be compensated using a suitable photonic-band gap structure inside the waveguide. Also an increase of signal-to-noise ratio of an incident optical field can be reached in the waveguide. Comment: 10 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{centroid}} {{frequency shift}} method is implemented, tested with synthetic data, {{and applied to}} field data from three contiguous crosswell seismic experiments at the Gypsy Pilot Site in northern Oklahoma. The simultane-ous iterative reconstruction technique is used for tomo-graphic estimations of both P-wave velocity and Q. No <b>amplitude</b> <b>corrections</b> or spreading loss corrections are needed for the Q estimation. The estimated in-situ ve-locity and Q distributions correlate well with log data and local lithology. The Q/velocity ratio appears to cor-relate with the sand/shale ratio (ranging from an average of» 15 s/km for the sand-dominated lithologies to an av-erage of » 8. 5 s/km for the shale-dominated ones), {{with the result that}} new information is provided on interwell connectivity...|$|R
