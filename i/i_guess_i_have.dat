It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to deal with it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology {{they are supposed to}} represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
2500|$|African-American singer Jackie Wilson {{recorded}} a tribute album to Jolson, You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet, which included his personal liner note, [...] "...the greatest entertainer {{of this or}} any other era... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just about every recording he's ever made, and I rarely missed listening to him on the radio.... During the three years I've been making records, I've had the ambition to do an album of songs, which, to me, represent the great Jolson heritage.. his is simply my humble tribute to the one man I admire most in this business... to keep the heritage of Jolson alive." ...|$|E

6000|$|So I was a {{mark for}} plunder at once, And lost my cash (can you wonder?) at once, But I didn't {{give up and}} knock under at once, I worked in the Yards, for a spell.

6000|$|... "Why, look thee, friend Oliver, this I take to {{have been}} the case. The fellow whom I cropped of a hand is now said {{to have been}} a servant of Sir John Ramorny's, who hath fled to his motherland of Fife, to which Sir John himself is also to be banished, with full consent of every honest man. Now, {{anything}} which brings in Sir John Ramorny touches a much greater man--I think Simon Glover told as much to Sir Patrick Charteris.

I know the first time I saw her I thought how {{wonderful}} it'd be to have a girl like that for my wife. It's all been so strange--her comin' an' how she made me feel. Sure I never knew many girls, and I haven't seen any girls at all for years. But when she came! A girl makes a wonderful difference in a man's feelin's and thoughts. I guess I never had any before. Leastways, none like I have now. My--it--well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a little understandin' now of Padre Marcos's blessin'." ...|$|E
60|$|Washington, Sept. 15, 1863. DEAR MOTHER--Your {{letters were}} very acceptable--one came just as I was putting my {{last in the}} post office--I guess they all come right. I have written to Han and George and sent George papers. Mother, have you heard {{anything}} whether the 51st went on with Burnside, or did they remain as a reserve in Kentucky? Burnside has managed splendidly so far, his taking Knoxville and all together--it is a first-class success. I have known Tennessee Union men here in hospital, and I understand it, therefore--the region where Knoxville is is mainly Union, but the Southerners could not exist without it, {{as it is in}} their midst, so they determined to pound and kill and crush out the Unionists--all the savage and monstrous things printed in the papers about their treatment are true, at least that kind of thing is, as bad as the Irish in the mob treated the poor niggers in New York. We North don't understand some things about Southerners; it is very strange, the contrast--if I should pick out the most genuine Union men and real patriots I have ever met in all my experience, I should pick out two or three Tennessee and Virginia Unionists I have met in the hospitals, wounded or sick. One young man <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mentioned to you in my letters, John Barker, 2nd Tennessee Vol. (Union), was a long while a prisoner in Secesh prisons in Georgia, and in Richmond--three times the devils hung him up by the heels to make him promise to give up his Unionism; once he was cut down for dead. He is a young married man with one child. His little property destroyed, his wife and child turned out--he hunted and tormented--and any moment he could have had anything if he would join the Confederacy--but he was firm as a rock; he would not even take an oath to not fight for either side. They held him about eight months--then he was very sick, scurvy, and they exchanged him and he came up from Richmond here to hospital; here I got acquainted with him. He is a large, slow, good-natured man, somehow made me often think of father; shrewd, very little to say--wouldn't talk to anybody but me. His whole thought was to get back and fight; he was not fit to go, but he has gone back to Tennessee. He spent two days with his wife and young one there, and then to his regiment--he writes to me frequently and I to him; he is not fit to soldier, for the Rebels have destroyed his health and strength (though he is only 23 or 4), but nothing will keep him from his regiment, and fighting--he is uneducated, but as sensible a young man as I ever met, and understands the whole question. Well, mother, Jack Barker is the most genuine Union man I have ever yet met. I asked him once very gravely why he didn't take the Southern oath and get his liberty--if he didn't think he was foolish to be so stiff, etc. I never saw such a look as he gave me, he thought I was in earnest--the old devil himself couldn't have had put a worse look in his eyes. Mother, I have no doubt there are quite a good many just such men. He is down there with his regiment (one of his brothers was killed)--when he fails in strength he gets the colonel to detach him to do teamster's duty for a few days, on a march till he recruits his strength--but he always carries his gun with him--in a battle he is always in the ranks--then he is so sensible, such decent manly ways, nothing shallow or mean (he must have been a giant in health, but now he is weaker, has a cough too). Mother, can you wonder at my getting so attached to such men, with such love, especially when they show it to me--some of them on their dying beds, and in the very hour of death, or just the same when they recover, or partially recover? I never knew what American young men were till I have been in the hospitals. Well, mother, I have got writing on--there is nothing new with me, just the same old thing, as I suppose it is with you there. Mother, how is Andrew? I wish to hear all about him--I do hope he is better, and that it will not prove anything so bad. I will write to him soon myself, but in the meantime you must tell him to not put so much faith in medicine--drugs, I mean--as in the true curative things; namely, diet and careful habits, breathing good air, etc. You know I wrote in a former letter what is the cause and foundation of the diseases of the throat and what must be the remedy that goes {{to the bottom of the}} thing--sudden attacks are to be treated with applications and medicines, but diseases of a seated character are not to be cured by them, only perhaps a little relieved (and often aggravated, made firmer).|$|E

[...] "I ain't ever been lonesome here, {{from the first}} minute. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> company enough when I was a girl to last me the sort that hotel folks are.

5000|$|Crouçie d'où là is {{no longer}} available. When Torrini was asked by a French fansite in a 2008 interview, she responded [...] :"No I really don't want it to.

5000|$|The team's {{future was}} also placed in doubt {{following}} an angry speech by Bronfman {{in which he}} threatened to relocate his family and the Seagram company outside Quebec if the separatist Parti Québécois won a majority government in the 1976 Quebec election.

She calls the Paley-Wilson material [...] "great therapy" [...] but says his vocals are not up to par and believes the production isn't good enough to be released commercially.
