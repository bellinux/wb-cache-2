These discussions have involved widely varying estimates based on <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> and model-based projections of the future. To investigate and understand the causes for such a disparity between these previous estimates, the authors analyzed the soil moisture at the near-surface soil layer and the entire soil column, {{as well as the}} Palmer <b>drought</b> severity <b>index,</b> the Palmer Z index, and the standardized precipitation and evaporation index using the output from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM 4), and 25 state-of-the-art climate models. These <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> were computed using potential evapotranspiration estimated by the physically based Penmanâ€“Monteith method (PE_pm) and the empirically based Thornthwaite method (PE_th). The results showed that the shortterm <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> are similar to modeled surface soil moisture and show a small but consistent drying trend in the future. The long-term <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> and the total column soil moisture, however, are consistent in projecting more intense future drought. When normalized, the <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> with PE_th all show unprecedented future drying, while the <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> with PE_pm show comparable dryness with the modeled soil moisture. Additionally, the <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> with PE_pm are closely related to soil moisture during both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Overall, the <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> with PE_pm, as well as the modeled total column soil moisture, suggest a widespread and very significant drying in the Great Plains {{toward the end of the}} century. The results suggest that the sharp contrasts about future drought risk in the Great Plains discussed in previous studies are caused by 1) comparing the projected changes in short-term droughts with that of the longterm droughts and/or 2) computing the atmospheric evaporative demand using an empirically based method (e. g., PE_th).

Changes in temperature and precipitation {{from year to year}} affect the Lyme disease incidence. Multiple studies have shown that there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation and the incidence of Lyme disease. After nymph ticks feed on and infect their host with Lyme disease they lose their ability to effectively control their water content. During a year with very little precipitation many ticks may die following feeding because of this loss of water regulatory control. These nymph ticks that have died out will never reach adulthood and lay eggs. Two years later their offspring nymph tick population will be reduced and thus Lyme disease incidence will also decrease. Schauber et. Al.

While drought is generally a consequence of atmospheric anomalies, the impacts to society are more directly related to hydrologic conditions. The present study uses a standardized runoff index (SRI) {{as a proxy for}} river discharge and as a benchmark for various meteorological <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> (scPDSI, SPI, SPEI_th, and SPEI_hg respectively). Only 12 -month duration droughts are considered in order to allow a direct (no river routing) comparison between meteorological anomalies and their hydrological counterpart. The analysis is conducted over the Mississippi and Amazon river basins, which provide two contrasted test beds for evaluating <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> at both interannual (using detrended data) and climate change (using raw data) timescales. Looking first at observations over {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, the simple SPI based solely on precipitation is no less suitable than more sophisticated meteorological <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> at detecting interannual SRI variations. Using the detrended runoff and meteorological outputs of a five-member single model ensemble of historical and 21 th century climate simulations leads to the same conclusion. Looking at the 21 st century projections, the response of the areal fraction in drought to global warming is shown to be strongly metric dependent and potentially overestimated by the <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> which account for temperature variations. These results suggest that empirical meteorological <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> should be considered with great caution in a warming climate and that more physical water balance models are needed to account for the impact of the anthropogenic radiative forcings on hydrological droughts...|$|R

The concept of hydrological management at subwatershed scale {{has been adopted}} because it encompasses the areal extent of a drought event. Fourteen (14) sub-watersheds of Pinios river basin were delineated according to the major tributaries of Pinios river using GIS. For the assessment of hydrological drought, because none of the sub-watersheds have flow gauge stations at their outlets, a six-parameter monthly conceptual water balance model (UTHBAL model), has been applied regionally to simulate runoff for the period October 1960 -September 2002. The synthetic runoff was normalized through Box-Cox transformation and standardized to the mean runoff to produce the water balance derived <b>drought</b> <b>index</b> for hydrological drought assessment.

40|$|Meteorological <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> are {{commonly}} calculated from climatic stations that have long-term historical data and then {{converted to a}} regular grid using spatial interpolation methods. The gridded <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> are mapped to aid decision making by policy makers and the general public. This study analyzes the spatial performance of interpolation methods for meteorological <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> in the United States {{based on data from}} the Co-operative Observer Network (COOP) and United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) for different months, climatic regions and years. An error analysis was performed using cross-validation and the results were compared for the 9 climate regions that comprise the United States. Errors are generally higher in regions and months dominated by convective precipitation. Errors are also higher in regions like the western United States that are dominated by mountainous terrain. Higher errors are consistently observed in the southeastern U. S. especially in Florida. Interpolation errors are generally higher in the summer than winter. The accuracy of different <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> was also compared. The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) tends to have lower errors than Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in seasons with significant convective precipitation. This is likely because SPEI uses both precipitation and temperature data in its calculation, whereas SPI is based solely on precipitation. There are also variations in interpolation accuracy based on the network that is used. In general, COOP is more accurate than USHCN because the COOP network has a higher density of stations. USHCN is a subset of the COOP network that is comprised of high quality stations that have a long and complete record. However the difference in accuracy is not as significant as the difference in spatial density between the two networks. For multiscalar SPI, USHCN performs better than COOP because the stations tend to have a longer record. The ordinary kriging method (with optimal function fitting) performed better than Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) methods (power parameters 2. 0 and 2. 5) in all cases and therefore it is recommended for interpolating <b>drought</b> <b>indices.</b> However, ordinary kriging only provided a statistically significant improvement in accuracy for the Palmer <b>Drought</b> Severity <b>Index</b> (PDSI) with the COOP network. Therefore it can be concluded that IDW is a reasonable method for interpolating <b>drought</b> <b>indices,</b> but optimal ordinary kriging provides some improvement in accuracy. The most significant factor affecting the spatial accuracy of <b>drought</b> <b>indices</b> is seasonality (precipitation climatology) and this holds true for almost all the regions of U. S. for 1 -month SPI and SPEI. The high-quality USHCN network gives better interpolation accuracy with 6 -, 9 - and 12 -month SPI and variation in errors amongst the different SPI time scales is minimal. The difference between networks is also significant for PDSI. Although the absolute magnitude of the differences between interpolation with COOP and USHCN are small, the accuracy of interpolation with COOP is much more spatially variable than with USHCN...|$|R
