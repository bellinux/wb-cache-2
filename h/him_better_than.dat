25|$|In 1964, {{he changed}} his first name to Christopher at the {{suggestion}} of Monique van Vooren, who had a nightclub act in which Walken was a dancer and who believed the name suited <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Ronnie (a pet form of his given name, Ronald), which he was credited as until then. He prefers to be known informally as Chris instead of Christopher.|$|E
25|$|As for Picasso... the {{tradition}} {{he came from}} had prepared <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we {{had no intention of}} prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The dross {{has been}} refined away, {{if there were}} any,' said Ulick. 'You {{will be able to}} love <b>him</b> <b>better</b> now <b>than</b> ever you did in life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{whose fault}} is that," [...] said the Lady, [...] "but yours, {{who should have}} taught <b>him</b> <b>better</b> discipline, <b>than</b> to brawl or to draw his dagger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know <b>him</b> <b>better</b> now <b>than</b> I used to.' He beckoned over Dan's shoulder, {{and spoke}} again in Latin. Puck pattered forward, holding himself as {{straight}} as an arrow. The Archbishop smiled.|$|R
500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> none." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 November 2014, ASO {{announced}} that for time {{the first time}} in Tour history the department of Manche would host the 2016 edition's opening race stages (known as the Grand Départ), before further details of the first three stages held in Manche were released [...] on 9 December 2014. On 15 January 2015, the organisers confirmed that the race would visit Andorra, for the fifth time in history; after the 1964, 1993, 1997 and 2009 editions. The principality hosted the finish of the ninth stage, the first rest day and start of stage ten. The entire route was unveiled by race director Christian Prudhomme on 20 October 2015 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The defending champion Chris Froome said after the route was {{announced that}} he expected the course to suit <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the previous year's course. [...] "I think it's going to take a complete cyclist– but the stage that certainly stands out for me is Mont Ventoux", he added.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Demonstration was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on ten reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, commenting that [...] "guest shots from Paloma Faith, Emeli Sandé, Dizzee Rascal, and others make this one crowded album, but figuring out what to drop is nearly impossible as everyone hits the mark." [...] Gigwise Nick Scott gave the album eight out of ten stars, saying that [...] "It would be wrong to compare Disc-Overy to Demonstration; this is the Tinie Tempah of now. It is a statement of his evolution as an artist and how his maturity and experience have now made <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> ever." [...] The Guardians Caroline Sullivan gave the album four stars, describing the production as [...] "stark electronics that recall his teen years as a grime MC" [...] and describing some lyrics as [...] "observant" [...] and [...] "sheer British genius". She questioned the commercial success of the album, claiming that [...] "rather than creating radio-loving hooks, Tinie has expended his energies on honing lyrics and flow".|$|E
50|$|When William Duncan joined Vitagraph, his {{contract}} was worth $1,000,000 a year, which made <b>him</b> <b>better</b> paid <b>than</b> Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. Mr. Duncan is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California, USA.|$|R
60|$|Simpson and I got on {{very well}} together, {{and made a}} very {{suitable}} pair. I like <b>him</b> much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I did when I started which was almost more than I hoped for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we're {{going to}} get away from it mighty quick,--if we can," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Camdal, pointedly. The close quarters did not suit <b>him</b> any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> it suited Mr. Dawson and the boys.|$|R
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Connick Jr. was lauded for his {{performance}} as a judge. USA Today, Rolling Stone, and MTV all claimed that he [...] "stole the spotlight" [...] during the season premiere with his humor and knowledgeable feedback. Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online suggested that Connick Jr. could save the struggling show. She called <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Simon Cowell, writing that while he is [...] "brutally honest", he also shows heart. Robert Rorke of the New York Post wrote that Connick Jr. was unlikely to [...] "save" [...] American Idol, but also wrote that he made the show watchable again by bringing class and keeping {{the focus on the}} contestants.|$|E
2500|$|Helen {{had only}} planned {{to stay in}} China for a year. However, over the next year, a {{courtship}} blossomed between Helen and Edgar. Their adventurous lifestyles in China served as the backdrop for their affair. In {{a letter from the}} winter of 1932, Helen wrote, [...] "I like <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone else I have ever known". Edgar [...] proposed to Helen on her 25th birthday, but she declined his offer. She didn't want their marriage to suffer because of her [...] "author psychology" [...] as she was working on a book. Several months later, Ed proposed once again and Helen accepted. The couple married on Christmas Day in 1932. The Snows would remain in China for nearly a decade.|$|E
60|$|Miss Fosbrook {{was glad}} {{to get away from}} the dining-room, where it was rather awful to sit without her work and be talked to by Mr. Merrifield, even though she liked <b>him</b> much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> she had expected.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has often}} {{described}} {{in his letters}} his welcome at your lordship's house. My mother keeps them all, you may be sure. Harry's style is not very learned, but his heart is so good, that to read <b>him</b> is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> wit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean we're both waiters in {{the same}} restaurant. Well, I don't know <b>him</b> any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I know that chap over there," [...] {{pointing}} to the other waiter. [...] "He's a Greaser or an Italian, and, I reckon, goes with his kind." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cantor Rabinowitz {{wants his}} son {{to carry on the}} generations-old family {{tradition}} and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, [...] "I'll teach <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to debase the voice God gave him!" [...] Jakie threatens: [...] "If you whip me again, I'll run away— and never come back!" [...] After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, [...] "My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight– but now I have no son." [...] As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.|$|E
2500|$|Because he {{has lived}} with Sheldon for several years, Leonard knows <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his other colleagues: this has led Sheldon to believe (slightly erroneously) that Leonard is his best friend. Nevertheless, Leonard often finds himself {{explaining}} Sheldon's behavior or serving as a mediator between him and other people in many situations. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny Sheldon's mother's phone number so she would call her son and scold him for his behavior, thus ending the fight. [...] "The Staircase Implementation" [...] features a flashback to when Leonard first moved in with Sheldon. Leonard explains to Penny that he moved in despite the difficulty of living with Sheldon because the rent was so reasonable. Shortly after moving in, during a rocketry experiment Leonard, Raj and Howard conducted, Sheldon observed miscalculations Leonard made in mixing the rocket fuel and managed to avert disaster by grabbing the fuel and placing it in their apartment building's elevator. The resulting explosion disabled the elevator, thus explaining why the elevator is out of order {{for the duration of}} the series. Leonard explains that Sheldon, despite his tendency to alienate others, kept quiet about Leonard's destruction of the elevator. (Leonard cites: [...] "He didn't rat me out to the landlord, or the police.... or Homeland Security.") ...|$|E
2500|$|On his return, Sunderland {{formally}} {{reverted to}} Anglicanism, taking the oaths in April 1691 and quietly recommenced {{sitting in the}} House of Lords. In May William {{paid a visit to}} him at his home in Althorp, Northamptonshire, to discuss public affairs. Over the next years the King frequently visited him and gave him confidence, but Sunderland did not dare to fully enter public life until September 1693, when he took a house in the city. He repeatedly advised the King to select all of his ministers from one political party, and eventually effected a reconciliation between William and his sister-in-law, the later Queen Anne. He was an influential adviser, inducing William to accept only Whigs in his government. William, never vindictive, was untroubled by Sunderland's past services to James, who had {{made it very clear that}} Sunderland was the one man he would never forgive, though he had made tentative advances towards the fallen King. Most of William's servants had at sometime betrayed him, and he valued Sunderland for his frankness and ability to voice unwelcome truths. It has been suggested that Sunderland's notorious rudeness actually appealed to the King, who detested flattery and could himself be distinctly rude. Once when William said that, while the Whigs personally liked <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the Tories, the Tories were better friends to Monarchy, Sunderland shrewdly replied: [...] "but you must consider that you are not their Monarch". He even wrote a letter telling the King that if his Ministers were not fit for his service, it was his own fault for not choosing better men.|$|E
60|$|George assented at once. His {{ideas as}} to the {{possibility}} of sleeping in the open air had vanished when he saw the surroundings, and a bed in a quiet loft seemed to <b>him</b> vastly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> sleeping in a room with twenty others.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother {{can manage}} <b>him</b> much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> we can," [...] said Bobus; [...] "besides, {{she is still}} a youngish woman, neither {{helpless}} nor destitute; and as I always tell you, the greatest kindness we can do her is {{to look out for}} ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Sedley {{was your}} very good friend, sir," [...] Dobbin interposed, almost pleased at finding himself growing angry. [...] "Time was you called <b>him</b> <b>better</b> names <b>than</b> rogue and swindler. The match was of your making. George {{had no right}} to play fast and loose--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} so. You {{may not come}} again,--not in this way. Do you {{remember}} what I told you before, in the garden; that I loved <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> all the world besides? It is still the same. I still love <b>him</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> all the world. How, then, can I give you any hope?" ...|$|E

5000|$|On 11 March 2008 Stephen Green {{was interviewed}} by openly gay celebrity Ian [...] "H" [...] Watkins for the BBC Wales {{programme}} Week In Week Out [...] where he told Watkins his lifestyle was ‘sinful’, and made <b>him</b> no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.|$|R
60|$|Like a flash {{the full}} {{realization}} of Jean Bevoir's plot forced itself upon the young pioneer. He was truly {{in the hands}} of the enemy, and it was safe to say that Bevoir would not treat <b>him</b> any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> had Pontiac, if as well.|$|R
