We {{focus on a}} measurement-based service for the <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of Internet hosts. Host locations are inferred by comparing delay patterns of geographically distributed landmarks, which are hosts with a known <b>geographic</b> <b>location,</b> with the delay pattern of the target host to be located. Results show a significant correlation between geographic distance and network delay that can be exploited for a coarse-grained <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of Internet hosts...|$|R

30|$|The {{population}} in OSNs grows over locations and time. In spatial aspect, {{people from different}} <b>geographic</b> <b>locations</b> may register as users in an OSN, thus people from more and more locations join in the network. The OSN expanding from locations to locations, leads {{to the growth of}} population spatially. At the same time, the {{population in}} each <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> grows in temporal scale. People in a <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> may be attracted to join in the network {{from time to time and}} thus the location will have more and more people. Therefore, combining spatial and temporal effects, we model the population growth as the accumulation of populations in different <b>geographic</b> <b>locations,</b> while population in each location changes as a function of time. We describe the population growth in spatial and temporal dimensions as follows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multimedia {{delivery}} systems, such as Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), improve {{by knowing}} the <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of their clients. Therefore, {{we focus on}} a measurement-based <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> service of Internet hosts. Such a service infers host locations from delay measurements taken from probe machines toward landmarks, which are hosts with a known <b>geographic</b> <b>location,</b> and the host to be located. We aim at mitigating the number of measurements generated in the network. We propose a two-tier hierarchical structure of landmarks to geographically locate an Internet host {{as opposed to a}} flat structure. In our two-tier structure, the upper level mitigates long distance measurements and the lower level keeps measurements within restricted areas. As a consequence, the two-tier <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> structure significantly reduces the number of measurements and thereby it favors scalability. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{company s}} main {{objective}} is creating shareholder value. International expansion {{is a strategy}} employed by companies in pursuit of growth and value creation. South Africa has been characterised by economic growth lower {{than the rest of}} Africa and developed countries. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Internationalisation becomes imperative for companies seeking growth and value creation. The objective was to investigate the impact of multinationality on value creation of multinational companies from South Africa. <b>Geographic</b> <b>location</b> and the degree of internationalisation were considered. Previous studies focussed on developed country multinationals, while this research study focused on South African multinationals to provide an emerging market perspective. Generalised linear models with fixed effects and t-tests were conducted to measure the effect multinationality, <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> and degree of multinationality has on the return of shareholders funds and market capitalisation. Market capitalisation demonstrated statistically significant results when tested against multinationality, degree of internationalisation and <b>geographic</b> <b>location.</b> However the effect of <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> on market capitalisation was negative. Return on shareholders funds had statistically significant results with negative effects when tested against multinationality and exhibited no significance with <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of investment and degree of internationalisation. Multinationality, <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> and the degree of internationalisation do affect company value creation.
