5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian <b>Klink,</b> both Danish immigrants. <b>Klink</b> was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and <b>Klink</b> and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E

5000|$|The alley {{is called}} Mårten <b>Klinks</b> gränd ("Mårten <b>Klink's</b> alley") in 1606 in {{reference}} to a local proprietor and in 1661 it {{is referred to as}} Mårten Klinkas eller Ignatij Grendh ("Mårten <b>Klink's</b> or Ignatius's alley"). The latter was a famous printer named Ignatius Meurer (1589-1672) who was, according to a memorial verse found in the Royal Library, born in Blankenburg, Schwarzburg, Germany, immigrated to Stockholm in 1610 and eventually through marriage became the owner of a printing workshop and settled in the block north of the alley.

25|$|Born in 1923, Ernst <b>Klink</b> {{grew up in}} Weimar and Nazi Germany; {{his mother}} was Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, head of National Socialist Women's League. In 1941 <b>Klink</b> joined the SS and was {{commissioned}} to the SS Division Leibstandarte, with which he fought in Joachim Peiper's regiment against the Soviet Union.

25|$|The {{unabridged}} audiobook {{version of}} the novel was released by Random House Audio in 1993, read by Werner Klemperer, best remembered for his two-time Emmy Award-winning role of bumbling Colonel <b>Klink</b> on the 1960s TV series Hogan's Heroes.|$|E
5000|$|General Albert Hans [...] "Hansi" [...] Burkhalter (portrayed by Leon Askin) - General Albert Burkhalter is <b>Klink's</b> gruff and rotund {{superior}} officer, who {{is promoted}} from Colonel to General by the High Command between the First and Second episodes of the series. His rank {{is equivalent to}} a lieutenant (three-star) general in the American forces. Burkhalter frequently tires of <b>Klink's</b> babbling ("Shut up, Klink!") and regularly threatens {{to send him to}} the Russian Front or have him shot. Burkhalter is mystified by Stalag 13's perfect no-escape record, unable {{to make sense of it}} in contrast with <b>Klink's</b> overall incompetence. <b>Klink's</b> outstanding record at Stalag 13 is the primary reason for the General never actually making good on any of his threats. Burkhalter's confusion over <b>Klink's</b> skill as a Commandant, when he appears to be an idiot in all other regards, is a running gag. Burkhalter affected to live a Spartan existence like a good German officer, but in reality, he loves the good life, even in war. He is scared of Mrs. Burkhalter (calling her [...] "the highest authority in Germany"), as evidence in the several times during the series, and after Hogan manages to get a few compromising photos of the General with very attractive women (in order to blackmail him). As the series progresses, Burkhalter suspects Hogan's greater role at Stalag 13; however, in the end, he, like the other Germans, comes to depend upon Hogan to get them out of trouble with the High Command when one scheme or the other runs off the tracks. Burkhalter usually arrived at Stalag 13 riding in one of the rare Mercedes-Benz W31 three-axle open-top staff cars, one of three still in existence in the 21st century.|$|R

5000|$|The prisoners' {{infiltration}} {{of the camp}} is so extensive it includes control of the camp telephone switchboard, allowing them to listen in on all conversations and to make phony phone calls. They have radio contact with Allied command. Their radio antenna is hidden in the camp flagpole on top of <b>Klink's</b> headquarters, and the prisoners {{are able to make}} phony radio broadcasts including some by a prisoner impersonating Adolf Hitler. A microphone hidden in <b>Klink's</b> office allows the prisoners to hear what is being said in the office. The guard dogs are friendly to the prisoners, thanks to the town veterinarian Oscar Schnitzer (played by Walter Janowitz), who supports the prisoners. He routinely replaces the dogs on the premise that they could become too friendly with the prisoners, but he also uses his truck to smuggle people and items {{in and out of the}} camp, where the German guards are too afraid of the dogs to open the truck. Prisoners work in the camp's motor pool and [...] "borrow" [...] vehicles, including <b>Klink's</b> staff car, as needed to carry out their schemes. Sections of the barbed wire fence are in a frame which the prisoners can easily lift when they need to get out of the camp. When required, Allied airplanes land near the camp, or make airdrops. Allied submarines pick up escapees and defectors Hogan and his men are helping flee Germany.|$|R
50|$|On September 7, the PVV {{said that}} they wanted to {{continue}} the negotiations with VVD and CDA because of <b>Klink's</b> departure. VVD and CDA also wanted to continue. Later that day, Mark Rutte went to the queen to discuss the new situation. After that, the queen once again appointed Herman Tjeenk Willink as informateur. He will speak with all of the party leaders about how the formation should proceed.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} the final work on Star Trek by {{executive}} producer Jeri Taylor. Pre-production began 24 days prior to shooting, with a morning meeting attended by Taylor, Brannon Braga, Joe Menosky, Kenneth Biller, Lisa <b>Klink</b> and Bryan Fuller. The initial idea presented was one which had been considered as the cliffhanger for the this involved duplicates of the Voyager crew.

In this pitch, the duplicates managed to return to the Alpha Quadrant to Deep Space Nine but it turns out to be an invasion.|$|E
500|$|The Danebod Stone Hall {{was built}} in 1889 and is a single-floor stone {{building}} {{in the form of}} a Latin cross. Its entrance wing features medieval-inspired crenellations, but the rest of the building with its pedimented windows are closer to being Greek Revival. It was built from native field rock hauled in by farmers and split and shaped by a Danish stonemason named Kristian <b>Klink.</b> The Stone Hall was used as the first church, later as a gymnasium and assembly hall. Points of interest are the outdoor old bell from the former children's school, fresco from the Gym Hall, the old chandelier from the Cross Church, old photographs, and handcut field stone in the structure. The Stone Hall is now a museum housing a collection of photographs, publications and objects important in Danebod history. It is also a venue for activities, lectures and discussion groups, and is typically open for public viewing during the Danebod Family Camp sessions.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Klink</b> was a {{contributor}} to the fourth volume, The Attack on the Soviet Union, of Germany and the Second World War, produced by historians of the MGFA. The volume appeared in 1983, and focused on Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. In what historian David Stahel describes as [...] "groundbreaking research" [...] that (as of 2009) was [...] "unsurpassed", <b>Klink</b> was the first to provide a comprehensive account of the military planning for Barbarossa. <b>Klink</b> was also the first to identify the German Army's independent planning for an attack on the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, known as Operation Otto. Stahel commends <b>Klink</b> on the operations study of the Battle of Smolensk, despite over-reliance on the files of the OKW and the OKH, which were [...] at times at odds with diaries of the combat units and did not fully reflect the difficulties on the ground.|$|E

5000|$|Major Bonacelli (portrayed by Hans Conried in {{the first}} appearance, Vito Scotti in the second appearance) - Major Bonacelli is a visiting food-obsessed {{commander}} of an Italian prisoner-of-war camp who is at Stalag 13 to learn <b>Klink's</b> techniques for no escapes. He is actually not at all supportive of the Fascist war effort, particularly the German war effort. In [...] "The Pizza Parlor", Hogan dissuades Major Bonacelli from defecting to neutral Switzerland and convinces him {{to act as an}} Allied spy at his POW camp in Italy.

2500|$|<b>Klink</b> {{joined the}} Military History Research Office (MGFA) at Freiburg in 1958. [...] In the same year, {{he became the}} {{spokesperson}} for the Tübingen branch of HIAG. Klink's tenure at MGFA was controversial, especially in recent assessments. According to Jens Westemeier in his biography of Jochen Peiper, <b>Klink</b> was [...] "one {{of the most important}} lobbyists for the in-house historical falsification" [...] by HIAG.

2500|$|Klink's {{colleague}} at the MGFA, Gerd R. Ueberschär, remarks that <b>Klink</b> based his study solely upon military records {{and attempted to}} portray the operations as [...] "apolitical".

According to Ueberschär other researchers denied this notion {{and it is not}} supported by the available records. [...] "Klink's narrow military view," [...] Ueberschär writes, [...] "also enticed him into sidling up to the long disproved Nazi claim that this was a preventive war".|$|E

However, in late December, <b>Klink</b> {{announced that he would}} not run.
