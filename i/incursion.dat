5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the <b>incursion</b> {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the <b>incursion</b> itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E

5|$|The Cambodian {{government}} was not informed of the <b>incursion</b> until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership had hoped for permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. It has been argued by some scholars that the <b>incursion</b> heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Aldea died {{in autumn}} 1436, {{enabling}} Vlad Dracul to seize Wallachia with Hungarian support.

5|$|Extensive {{logistical}} installations {{and large}} amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of military material had already been moved further from the border to shelter it from the <b>incursion</b> into Cambodia by the U.S. and South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several days, Japanese forces {{launched}} air raids to counter the <b>incursion.</b> These included the first widespread use of the kamikaze suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward San Bernardino Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon.|$|E

40|$|Dispersal is male-biased in ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus), {{although}} female dispersal also occurs (Teichroeb et al., 2009). Here {{we describe}} the process of male dispersal and its connection with between-group encounters (BGEs, N = 444) and male <b>incursions</b> (when males left their group and approached within 50 m of another group; N = 128) at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in central Ghana. Through BGEs and <b>incursions,</b> particularly those with non-aggressive interactions between individuals in different groups (BGEs, N = 17; <b>incursions,</b> N = 4), males could probably assess other groups for dispersal opportunities. There was a trend for males to perform <b>incursions</b> more frequently before emigrating voluntarily than involuntarily. <b>Incursions</b> were often performed towards the group that the male eventually transferred to. <b>Incursions</b> by alpha males were temporally shorter and more aggressive than those by non-alpha males. We suggest that non-alpha males used <b>incursions</b> to assess other groups for breeding or dispersal opportunities, whereas alpha males performed <b>incursions</b> mainly to convey information about their quality to neighbouring males and females. Male emigrations/disappearances (natal N = 20, secondary N = 43, unknown N = 9) and immigrations (N = 62) were recorded for seven groups during ten years (2000 - 2010). Alpha males always emigrated involuntarily. Parallel emigration and immigration occurred. Males often immigrated into groups with a more favourable adult male/adult female ratio and improved their rank, both of which likely increased their mating opportunities. The most fitting ultimate explanation for both natal and secondary male dispersal in this population was the intrasexual competition for mates hypothesis, as males of all ages appeared to emigrate to improve their reproductive opportunities.

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to the <b>incursion</b> was gradual. Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force {{off the coast of}} the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of Vinh. Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the <b>incursion</b> area, the 304th, 308th and 320th. The 2nd Division had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.|$|E

5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism.

Dewey Canyon II would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 {{all the way to}} the old Khe Sanh Combat Base, which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN <b>incursion.</b> U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese.
