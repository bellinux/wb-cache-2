40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{hydration}} behaviour of the polymer modified jute <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> paste. In this investigation, different polymer contents in the emulsion (i. e., 0. 0257 %, 0. 0513 %, 0. 1025 % and 0. 2050 %) were used to prepare the polymer modified jute <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> paste. The hydration characteristic of the cement samples was assessed by monitoring the extent of hydrated cement product. Based on the X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis of the hydrated cement samples, it is revealed that the polymer modified (0. 0513 %) jute <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> sample produces a greater extent of hydrated cement product as {{compared to that of}} the unmodified <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> sample. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the unmodified jute <b>fibre</b> delays the <b>cement</b> hydration reaction, whilst, the use of an optimum polymer content in the emulsion (0. 0513 %) recovers the hydration delaying action of jute fibre. Finally, a model has been proposed to explain the overall performances of the polymer modified jute <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> paste. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gusts as high as [...] and sustained winds of [...] were recorded at Townsville Airport, though the anemometer was somewhat sheltered by upwind Castle Hill, so stronger winds may have occurred. The storm bent large steel utility poles and lifted houses off their foundations, while entirely stripping trees of their leaves. Dislodged debris acted as projectiles, penetrating <b>fibre</b> <b>cement</b> walls. In some cases, entire roofs crashed down on vehicles and other property. Power outages were extensive. One post-storm survey of 6,000 houses in Townsville found around 0.7% totally demolished, 1.7% with critical but repairable damage, and 13.3% with minor damage. Other estimates placed the share of damaged or destroyed houses at 60%. Several months after the storm, the Townsville City Council reported that about 200 houses had been leveled – about 1 in every 100 – with 600 more rendered uninhabitable, and as many as 4,000 damaged. Among the structures damaged or destroyed were 200 Queensland Housing Commission homes and roughly 500 of the 700 War Service Homes Commission dwellings in Townsville. Overall, Althea wrought at least $6 million in damage to government-owned buildings. The cyclone killed two people in Townsville: one man was crushed when his home collapsed, and another suffered a stress-related heart attack.|$|E

Creep and drying shrinkage of the composites and the durability of natural <b>fibres</b> in <b>cement</b> based matrices are of particular interest and are also highlighted. The results show that the composites reinforced with sisal fibres are reliable materials to be used in practice for the production of structural elements to be used in rural and civil construction. This material could be a substitute asbestos-cement composite, which is a serious hazard to human and animal health and is prohibited in industrialized countries.

40|$|The thesis expounds {{the logic}} behind {{a new concept}} of {{composite}} construction which exploits <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> composites {{in the form of}} channels, placed in the tensile zone of reinforced concrete T-beams. The <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> composites, which act as 'surface reinforcement', incorporate high modulus, asbestos fibres in a predominantly two-dimensional random distribution in a cement matrix. Compared with concrete, these units have a high tensile strength and greater extensibility. The first stage of this investigation is primarily concerned with the design of the <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> composites of suitable mechanical properties for use as surface reinforcement in large structural components. The mechanical properties are affected both by the thickness and the composition of these composites. In the second stage the structural utilisation of the composites is examined in relation to strength, cracking and deflection characteristics; static, fatigue and sustained loading tests are carried out on reinforced concrete T-beams cast in conjunction with asbestos-cement composites. Altogether twenty-four beams are tested, the cross-sections of which, the type and the amount of tensile steel remain constant, whereas the variables investigated are the effect of the upstand length, thickness and composition of the surface reinforcement. It is shown that this type of construction considerably enhances the structural performance of reinforced concrete beams; the degree of improvement being a function of the composition and the upstand length of the surface reinforcement. At the design working load, for example, the deflection is reduced by up to 33...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} stress-strain behaviour {{of individual}} <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cement</b> composites is reviewed. Based on the multiple cracking {{concept of the}} existing theory, analytical expressions are developed to describe the tensile stress-strain behaviour of a fibre-cement hybrid composite consisting of three components, i. e. two reinforcing fibres with different moduli, strengths and strains to failure and a common cement binder. The model predicts that the tensile stress-strain curve of the hybrid composites consists of five stages, instead of three stages of the existing models for individual <b>fibre</b> <b>cements,</b> and relates the tensile behaviour of each stage to the component properties of the components and the test system parameters. A description is given of the physical and mechanical properties of four types of reinforcing fibres used in the study. These were fibrillated polypropylene film, alkali-resistant glass, polyvinyl alcohol fibres and carbon fibres. A small number of direct tensile tests on continuous glass, carbon and polyvinyl alcohol were performed. The tensile stress-strain behaviour of four types of fibre-cement hybrid composites was studied with particular emphasis on that of the glass- polypropylene hybrids for which the flexural load-deflection behaviour was also examined. It is shown that the fibre-cement hybrid composites yield superior engineering properties over their parent composites and the improvements are sensitive to volume fractions {{of each of the}} two fibres. The measured tensile stress-strain curves of the hybrids were compared with the theoretical predictions and satisfactory agreement in general is obtained. Implications from the present work for the design of fibre-cement hybrid composites are assessed...|$|R

40|$|Several well {{established}} techniques of soil stabilisation and soil reinforcement {{are available to}} improve properties of geotechnical materials. However, the addition of fibre into soils has its unique potential as a reinforcing agent. This is because a friction between fibre and soil particles increases the bonding between the particles of soils and this can improve the plasticity, stress-strain behaviour and failure characteristics of both cemented and uncemented soils. It also reduces the brittleness of the cemented sand. Numerous experiments on fibre-reinforced granular materials {{have been carried out}} by several researchers. However, the behaviour of fibre-reinforced cemented granular soils has not been fully understood yet. Furthermore, most experimental studies of <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cemented</b> materials have been carried out at relatively low confining pressures. As a result, more experiments are still needed to understand complicated behaviour of soil-cement-fibre composite materials. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse the behaviour of <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>cemented</b> sand under wide range of confining pressures. For this GDS high pressure triaxial cell apparatus and Bishop and Wesley conventional triaxial cell apparatus have been used to carry out the tests at wide range of confining pressures from 50 kPa to 20 MPa. Drained and undrained tests have been carried out on polypropylene fibre reinforced sand with and without the addition of cement. Samples with varying <b>fibre</b> and <b>cement</b> content were prepared by the method of undercompaction and were cured for 28 days prior to testing. The experimental results indicate that there is a significant effect from the addition of <b>fibre</b> and/or <b>cement</b> contents and confining pressures on the mechanical behaviour of Portaway sand. Particularly, these effects were noted in drained and undrained triaxial tests, particularly peak strength, strength parameters, shear banding, particle crushing, yielding, and stress-dilatancy relationships. The addition of fibres increases the peak, yield, and ultimate strengths. Increase in confining pressure also increases the strength but the individual effect of the addition of fibres was more pronounced at low confining pressures. Progressive suppression in the dilation by the gradual increase in confining pressures as well as an increase in dilation with the addition of fibres during triaxial compression was also worth noticeable. Although, no noticeable affect was observed in isotropic compression due to the addition of <b>fibre</b> in both <b>cemented</b> and uncemented sand. An extensive series of tests were carried out but due to time constraint only one type and length of fibre was used. Therefore, more research needs to be carried out at different fibre lengths and types in order to see that whether these change the behaviour observed in this research.

However, difficulties in carrying out valid direct tensile tests have limited the research in this field. The scarcity of investigation on the tensile behaviour of glass fibre reinforced concrete (GFRC) is also probably due to the ageing problems of GFRC systems. In order to contribute to a better knowledge of the uniaxial tensile behaviour of GFRC, deformation-controlled uniaxial tensile tests were carried out at Stevin Laboratory (NL).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the chemical changes have indeed occurred at the surface, and contact angle measurements showed that the surface energy has also changed. MPTS- and AI-treated fibres presented lower hydrophilic character than untreated fibres, whereas APTS increased the water retention value of the pulp.
