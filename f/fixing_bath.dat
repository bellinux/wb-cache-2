Lebanese Science Journal, 18 (1) : 122 - 135. 			Histopathological changes after bites of the Montivipera bornmuelleri viper, endemic to high altitudes areas of Lebanon, {{have not yet}} been investigated. Our study focuses on histological changes and irreversible damages in the kidney and liver of white laboratory Balb/c mice that received an intramuscular injection of lyophilized venom diluted in saline solution (NaCl 0. 9 %). Different venom concentration doses ranging from 0. 25 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg in a total injection volume of 100 µl was injected intramuscularly (IM) into 5 groups of mice. After dissection, observations showed no macroscopically identifiable damages in any of the organs studied. However, tissue samples from the liver and the kidney were obtained for histological studies at various time intervals following the venom injection. The histological study was carried out using the Bouin solution (<b>fixing</b> <b>bath),</b> followed by dehydration in alcohol. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained using hemalun-easine. Tissues from 6 control mice, which received only an injection of saline solution, were also examined. The common histological alterations observed microscopically in the liver and the kidney were: pycnotic nuclei, necrosis, vacuolization, cytoplasmic destruction, edema, hemorrhage and congestion of blood vessels. Moreover, inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytic cells was observed in the prevascular regions of both organs. The histological changes observed appeared within 1 h and intensified with time. These changes were proportional to the dose of the venom injected into the laboratory mice. Our results on what happens in the kidney and liver of mice after injecting the venom of M. bornmuelleri had many similarities with the effect of venom of other vipers (e. g.

The color varies somewhat with the emulsion used. In the diagram page 16, the three primary color formers are {{shown at the}} points of a triangle. Any desired color between these primaries {{can be obtained by}} mixing color formers at the ends of connecting lines. The colors of bleached prints will be obtained along the sides of the triangle while unbleached prints will have their color [ilg] mixed with a greenish black silver imag[e] and the colors so formed will lie inside the triangle., Limiting the developer to one-[ilg] gram per liter pure whites can be obtained. W[hen] prints are being redeveloped after bleaching the [q]uantity can be increased and the development t[ilg]e shortened. This solution is best made up as a stoc[k s]olution containting everything but the developing ag[ent] which is added shortly before use (same day). Th[e r]eason for this procedure is that the developer so[l]ution changed fairly rapidly if fully mixed due to fairly high alkalinity. The color formers are ma[de] up as 1 % solutions of the chemical in some or[gan]ic solvent such as alcohol or acetone. The color [ilg]ers are generally insoluble in a neutral water solution. These color former stock solutions will keep in bro[ilg] bottles for over a month without noticeable c[h]ange. The developer solution is put into the tray or tank and the proper amount of color former added just before development. The activity of the fin[a]l mixed solution changed quite rapidly and prints c[a]nnot be duplicated without making compensations in exposure and development time. Large quantities of prints can be tank developed at one time in racks. The time of development controls the contrast as in black and white work although as in al printing papers, the development should always be longer than a specified minimum., The exposure should be adjusted that development takes at least three minutes and it may be carried up to ten minutes without danger of fogging the paper if properly handled. The developed print is rinsed for about one minute in running water and then immersed in a hypo bath for not over fifteen minutes. Due to the fact that a normal acid <b>fixing</b> <b>bath</b> decolorizes some of the dyes, and alkaline bath is used. The formula is:, Sodium sulfite 40 grams, 25 % Hypo solution 1 liter, Formaldehyde 100 cc., After fixing, the prints are washed as usual and dried. The procedure when using transparency stock is exactly the same., The worker can exercise the greatest control in the mixing of the developer solution. For normal work the two developing agents found most useful were diethyl-p-phenylene-diamin[ilg] hydrochloride and 2 -amino- 5 -diethylaminotoluene mono-hydrochloride. Either one can be substituted [ilg] the formula for developing agent although somewhat different colors are obtained with some color [ilg]ormers as indicated in Table I. The most useful co[ilg] formers for common use are maginta (p-nitrophenylacetonitrile), a blue (a-naphthol), a cyan (2, 4 dichloro- 1 -naphthol), and a yellow (acetoacet 2, 5 dichloroanilide). These four couplers have been chosen because of the possibility of getting almost a[n]y desired color from them, and also because they give images of roughly similar contrast when proce[ss]ed under the described conditions. l By using the four ocuplers almost any conceivable color can be obtained by simply making the color former sol[utio]n {{to be added to the}} developer from combinations of two or more of the above stock solutions. Thus in Table I we have a few common combinations that will possibly prove useful as a starting point. With a few prints made from known couplers or combinations, any color desired between two chosen prints can be obtained simply by changing the relative quantities of the color formers as shown in Table II. It is thus apparent that the common sepias, browns, and blues are readily obtained by direct development without taking longer to produce than a normal black and white print, and that many other colors that cannot be obtained in any other way are easily secured. The firal image in such work consists of both dye and silver. If a pure dye image is desired the fully washed print may be bleached in Farmer's reducer. The removal of the black silver of course brightens the colors to a considerable extent, which is desired is a matter of personal preference. The removal of silver leads to a lowering of contrast in the picture so that when bleaching is contemplated the print development should be carried a little further than required for an unbleached print. The permanence of some of the colors obtained is open to question as some of them are undoubtedly not very fast to light. Prints exposed for over a year under normal conditions, however, show no signs of fading, although if left in direct sunlight for some time fading is noticeable. As most colors fade under such treatment, it is not a serious objection to their use. For practical purposes, the prints are stable enough. It is of course evident that transparencies may be made in a similar mannder either on film, plates, or the special materials., The application of such methods of making colored pictures to direct color photography is naturally of great interest. There are many problems involved in the manufacture of monopacks for such work, among them the choice of color formers which have the proper spectral hues as well as satisfying the rigid demands of the manufacture of the material. There must be rigid control of coating and sensitization of emulsions as well as processing conditions, any errors in which will upset the balance of the six variables of density and contrast. The outstanding success of the new Agfacolor and Kodachrome processes testifies to the possibilities of the dye coupling method. The basic difference in these two processes is that the Agfa process uses a monopack film in the three, (Continued on page 32); 18; photo technique September 1939 " [...] on article...|$|E

The panoramic view printed on a single sheet of paper show all the buildings from Agricultural Hall to the Observatory on George’s Hill. The large sheet of albumen paper for this panorama was supplied by the John H. Clemons factory on Sansom Street. The whites of one hundred and twenty five dozen eggs were required to coat the paper. To produce the print the entire sheet had to be exposed to sunlight, one section at a time, under each negative. Careful joining of the negatives was required to prevent a dark line from appearing at each juncture. Each section had to be printed to the same density despite the ever changing light from the sky. After printing out to a much darker shade than desired, the final appearance of the print was achieved through gold toning which had to be evenly applied or some of the blacks would have a bluish cast and others a reddish tone. Great difficulty was also encountered handling such a large sheet of wet paper as it passed through the <b>fixing</b> <b>baths,</b> toning and washing processes.

Gravimetric and electrochemical measurements, SEM, XRD were applied to characterize the films. The weight of Ni-Fe-P film increases near linearly with the plating time. The deposition potential shifts to negative direction and the plating current decreases {{with the increase of}} FeSO 4, when the total concentration of the metal salts is <b>fixed</b> in <b>bath.</b> Increasing the FeSO 4 concentration also causes an increase in the polarization resistances, indicating the FeSO 4 has an inhibition effect on the chemical process. The plating current derived in the complete bath is higher than that determined from the simulation half-reaction cells due to the interaction between the two half reactions. It is found that the ratio of FeSO 4 /(NiSO 4 +FeSO 4) affects the composition of Ni-Fe-P film, leading to the structure change of the film...|$|R
5000|$|Significant {{emphasis}} was also placed on town planning, with new conservation areas introduced {{and a new}} generation of new towns built, notably Milton Keynes. The New Towns Acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority (through its ministries) to designate any area of land as a site for a New Town. The government also combined its push for the construction of more new housing with encouragement and subsidisation of the renovation of old houses (as an alternative to their destruction and replacement). The Housing Improvement Act 1969, for example, made it easier to turn old houses into new homes by encouraging rehabilitation and modernisation through increased grants to property owners. The Act sought to place the economics of housing improvement in a much better relationship to those of redevelopment. Under the Act, local authorities were provided with powers to designate [...] "improvement areas" [...] and to pursue a policy of area-wide improvement. An area could be declared an improvement area if 50% or more of the dwellings within its bounds lacked {{at least one of the}} following standard amenities, which included hot and cold running water, an inside toilet, a sink, a wash basin, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>bath</b> or shower. Local authorities in the area could encourage householders in the area to improve their dwellings with the aid of grants. The legislation also introduced major financial changes, including an increase in the normal total standard grant from £155 to £200, an increase from £400 to £1000 in the maximum improvement grant that might be given at the discretion of the local authority, and a new Exchequer grant to local authorities of 50% of the expense for environmental improvement on costs of up to £100 per dwelling in newly designated improvement areas. The legislation introduced special grants for installing amenities in houses in multi-occupation and government grants towards environmental improvement up to an expenditure of £100 per dwelling, while approved works of repair and replacement became eligible for grant aid for the first time ever. Altogether, between 1965 and 1970, over 2 million homes had been constructed (almost half of which were council properties), more than in any other five-year period since 1918.|$|R
40|$|The inotropic {{and toxic}} effects of cardiac glycosides {{are thought to}} be related to their ability to inhibit the Na,K-ATPase. We {{examined}} the effects of ouabain and its analogs on sarco-plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 release in intact cat ventricular myocytes under Na-free conditions and in myocytes in which the sarcolemma was permeabilized using saponin so that cy-toplasmic ionic composition was <b>fixed</b> by the <b>bath</b> solutions. We also compared ouabain actions in cat myocytes to those in rat myocytes because the latter {{is considered to be a}} glyco-side-insensitive species. In intact cat myocytes (Na-free con-ditions), spontaneous Ca 2 sparks were prolonged and fre-quency, amplitude and width were reduced by exposure to ouabain (3 M). Nearly identical results were obtained with its analogs dihydroouabain or ouabagenin (10 M). The frequenc...|$|R
40|$|Introduced is a lattice-gas with {{long-range}} 2 -body interactions. An e#ective inter-particle {{force is}} mediated by momentum exchanges. There exists {{the possibility of}} having both attractive and repulsive interactions using finite impact parameter collisions. There also exists an interesting possibility of coupling these long-range interactions to a heat <b>bath.</b> A <b>fixed</b> temperature heat <b>bath</b> induces a permanent net attractive interparticle potential, but {{at the expense of}} reversibility. Thus the long-range dynamics {{is a kind of a}} Monte Carlo Kawasaki updating scheme. The model has a P#T equation of state. Presented are analytical and numerical results for a lattice-gas fluid governed by a nonideal equation of state. The model's complexity is not much beyond that of the FHP lattice-gas. It is suitable for massively parallel processing and may be used to study critical phenomena in large systems. 1 Introduction Nonideal fluids, with dynamics governed by reversible physical laws, undergo phas [...] ...|$|R
