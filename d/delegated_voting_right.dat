The second party congress was held October 2 - 4, 1920, in Haifa. At the congress, there were 18 <b>delegates</b> with <b>voting</b> <b>rights,</b> 4 <b>delegates</b> without <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> and 1 representative of the World Union of Poalei Zion. The delegates represented approximately 300 party members, from local branches in Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Petach Tikva and amongst road construction workers in Tiberias and Alexandria.|$|R

25|$|Several states, {{most notably}} Florida, {{scheduled}} their allocating contests earlier than prescribed, {{and in response}} every traditional early state except Nevada pushed their contests back into January. As {{a result of their}} violation of RNC rules, these states were penalized with a loss of half their <b>delegates,</b> including <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> for RNC <b>delegates.</b> Despite having early caucuses, Iowa, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri were not penalized because their contests did not allocate national delegates.|$|R

50|$|Catholic Ecumenical Councils include 21 councils over {{a period}} of 1700 years. While {{definitions}} changed throughout history, in today's Roman Catholic understanding Ecumenical Councils are assemblies of Patriarchs, Cardinals, residing Bishops, Abbots, male heads of religious orders and other juridical persons, nominated by the Pope. The purpose of an ecumenical council is to define doctrine, reaffirm truths of the Faith, and extirpate heresy. Council decisions, to be valid, are approved by the popes. Participation is limited to these persons, who cannot <b>delegate</b> their <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
40|$|Proxy {{voting is}} a form of voting, where the voters can either vote on an issue directly, or <b>delegate</b> their <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> to a proxy. This proxy might for {{instance}} be a trusted expert on the particular issue. In this work, we extend the widely studied end-to-end verifiable Helios Internet voting system towards the proxy voting approach. Therefore, we introduce a new type of credentials, so-called delegation credentials. The main purpose of these credentials is to ensure that the proxy has been authorised by an eligible voter to cast a <b>delegated</b> <b>vote.</b> If voters, after delegating, change their mind and want to vote directly, cancelling a delegation is possible throughout the entire voting phase. We show that the proposed extension preserves the security requirements of the original Helios system for the votes that are cast directly, as well as security requirements tailored toward proxy voting...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>delegates</b> with full <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> participating in Congress, there are also participants in an advisory capacity which can participate in debates but have no <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b> These may consist of office holders such {{as members of the}} Zionist Executive, members of the Zionist General Council who were not elected as delegates to Congress, Chairs of the Zionist Federations, judicial office holders - the President of the Zionist Supreme Court, the Attorney, the Comptroller and representatives of the Aliyah Movement.|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Cryptographic ProtocolsInternational audienceIn general, most {{elections}} {{follow the}} principle of equality, or as {{it came to be}} known, {{the principle of}} “one man – one vote”. However, this principle might pose difficulties for voters, who are not well informed regarding the particular matter that is voted on. In order to address this issue, a new form of voting has been proposed, namely proxy voting. In proxy voting, each voter has the possibility to <b>delegate</b> her <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> to another voter, so called proxy, that she considers a trusted expert on the matter. In this paper we propose an end-to-end verifiable Internet voting scheme, which {{to the best of our}} knowledge is the first scheme to address voter coercion in the proxy voting setting...|$|R
50|$|However, the Democratic National Committee {{determined}} that {{the date of the}} Michigan Democratic Primary violated the party rules and ultimately decided to sanction the state, stripping all 156 delegates and refusing to seat them at the convention. Despite this, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the primary could go ahead as scheduled. The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee later met on May 31, 2008, and agreed to seat all of Michigan's delegates with each delegate receiving half of a vote. As a result of this compromise, Michigan had 78 votes at the convention. On August 24, the <b>delegates</b> had full <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> restored.|$|R
500|$|The 6th Congress was {{attended}} by 3,062 <b>delegates</b> with <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> and 158 without them; this marked an increase of 1,349 voting and 137 non-voting delegates from the 5th Congress. The increase indicates a growth in membership. The 6th Congress is significant for its large number of delegations: 177 delegations from 118 countries were represented. While communist and workers' parties customarily invite [...] "fraternal parties" [...] to party congresses, the WPK had taken {{the unusual step of}} not inviting foreign delegations to the 1st, 2nd and 5th congresses. Among those invited this time were the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The WPK leadership also invited a number of non-communist parties and organizations to the congress. The official report said that 155 foreign organizations from 105 countries attended the congress, indicating that 22 delegations remained incognito. For unknown reasons, no foreign delegates spoke at the congress.|$|R
5000|$|He {{soon became}} project {{director}} for Mississippi's 2nd congressional district, made up {{largely in the}} counties of the Mississippi Delta. At that time, most blacks in Mississippi were still disenfranchised. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and to conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the 1964 Democratic Convention {{in support of the}} MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated. But, the MFDP <b>delegates</b> were refused <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> by the Democratic National Committee, who chose to seat the regular white Jim Crow delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called [...] "totalitarian liberal opinion." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{proposed}} that firms can internalize externalities through their shareholders. This paper investigates this proposition, focusing on public bads. Theoretically it is, indeed, possible that shareholders decide that the firm reduces its public bads {{at the cost of}} profits, thereby increasing Pareto-efficiency. One of the factors which help determine the size of the reduction is the number of shareholders with a (very) small stake in the firm. The greater this number, the greater the reduction will tend to be. It is shown that the reduction in public bads can be reversed by takeovers, but under special conditions only while takeover defences may also be used. Unfortunately, {{there are a number of}} factors which significantly limit the internalization of external effects in practice. The paper also discusses a change in the legal share-voting system whereby the direct owners of the shares (i. e., the shareholders) no longer possess, in their capacity of direct owners, the legal <b>right</b> to <b>vote</b> at the General Meetings of firm owners. Instead, these rights become the property of the beneficial owners of the shares (i. e., the people who ultimately provided the money to buy the shares), but on the condition that they <b>delegate</b> their <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> to a proxy voting institution. This institutional innovation may significantly increase the internalization of external effects among other things because many beneficial owners have a tiny stake in the firm...|$|R

5000|$|The {{split in}} the republican {{movement}} was completed at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis on 10-11 January at the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge, Dublin, when the proposal to drop abstention was put before the members. The policy of abandoning abstentionism had to be passed by a two-thirds majority to change the party's constitution. Again, there were allegations of malpractice and that pro-Goulding supporters cast votes they were not entitled to. In addition, the leadership had also refused <b>delegate</b> status (<b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> {{to a number of}} Sinn Féin cumainn (branches), particularly in the north and in County Kerry, where they knew them to be opposed. The motion was debated all of the second day, and when it was put to a vote at 5.30 p.m. the result was 153:104 in favour of the motion but failing to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority. The leadership then attempted to propose a motion in support of the (pro-Goulding) IRA Army Council, led by Tomás Mac Giolla. This motion would only have required a simple majority. As the (pro Goulding) IRA Army Council had already resolved to drop abstentionism, this was seen by the minority group (led by MacStiofain and Ó Brádaigh) as an attempt to subvert the party's constitution. They refused to vote and withdrew from the meeting. Anticipating this move by the leadership, they had already booked a hall in 44 Parnell Square, where they established a [...] "caretaker executive" [...] of Sinn Féin. The Caretaker Executive declared itself opposed to the ending of abstentionism, the drift towards [...] "extreme forms of socialism", the failure of the leadership to defend the nationalist people of Belfast during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, and the expulsion of traditional republicans by the leadership during the 1960s.|$|R
