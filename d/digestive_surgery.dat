40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the evolution of}} scientific papers published on <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgery</b> in Brazilian journals in 20 years and examine whether the level of evidence in the studies has improved, {{as well as the}} incorporation of statistical procedures and their proper application. MethodsWe selected all original articles related to <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgery</b> published in the years of 1987 and 2007 in 4 leading Brazilian surgical journals. Studies were divided according to the level of evidence (I: prospective, controlled and randomized, II: prospective without control or randomization and III: retrospective) and compared them to assess whether there was an improvement in the level of evidence between these two years surveyed. We also assessed whether there was increased use of analytical statistics and correct application of statistical procedures. ResultsComparing the articles published in 1987 with those of 2007, we observed no improvement with respect to the level of evidence, with {{more than half of the}} articles published being case series and retrospective studies (56. 14 %). There has been a significant increase in the use of analytical statistics (70. 4 % in 2007 vs. 40 % in 1987) in the 20 years, however 16. 7 % of the studies published in 2007 did not correctly apply or adequately describe the statistical analyses used.

40|$|Background: Whether the {{contribution}} of nonurinary nitrogen excretion (N(2) nu) to total nitrogen excretion (N(2) tot) is clinically relevant has not been tested in children in an intensive care unit. Particularly after <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgery,</b> fecal nitrogen losses, and losses via nasogastric tubes, enterostomies and wound drains may be large. Methods: We prospectively measured urinary nitrogen excretion (N(2) u) and N(2) nu 4 to 6 days after <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgery</b> in 78 newborns and infants who were given total parenteral nutrition. Results: Two hundred seven collections of excreta, each representing one 24 -hour period, were obtained. Median N 2 nu was 15 mg/kg/ 24 hours (range, 0. 4 - 153), median N(2) u 153 mg(kg/ 24 hours (range, 57 - 558), median N(2) tot 179 mg/kg(24 hours (range, 72 - 577), and the median ratio of N(2) nu and N(2) u 9. 9 % (range, 0. 2 - 110). The observed variations could not be attributed to differences in {{the severity of the}} underlying disease or the surgical stress. The mean difference between N(2) tot and N(2) u was 21 mg/kg/ 24 hours (95 % prediction interval - 20 to + 63). Use of a linear regression equation that predicts N(2) tot according to N(2) u and the weights of other excreta eliminated bias and improved precision (95 % prediction interval - 34 to + 34 mg/kg/ 24 hours). For individual measurements, however, considerable imprecision remained. Conclusions: In newborns and *infants, receiving parenteral. nutrition 4 to 6 days after <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgery,</b> N(2) nu is variable and not to be neglected. The only way to accurately assess N(2) tot in individual patients is by measuring the nitrogen content of all excreta...|$|R

At the Department of Minimally Invasive Upper <b>Digestive</b> <b>Surgery</b> of the Hospital for <b>Digestive</b> <b>Surgery</b> in Belgrade, hybrid {{minimally}} invasive esophagectomy (hMIE) {{has been a}} standard of care for patients with resectable esophageal cancer since 2009. As a next and final step in the change management, from January 2015 we utilized total {{minimally invasive}} esophagectomy (tMIE) as a standard of care. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to report initial experiences in hMIE (laparoscopic approach) for cancer and analyze surgical technique, major morbidity and 30 -day mortality. Methods. A retrospective cohort study included 44 patients who underwent elective hMIE for esophageal cancer at the Department for Minimally Invasive Upper <b>Digestive</b> <b>Surgery,</b> Hospital for <b>Digestive</b> <b>Surgery,</b> Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade from April 2009 to December 2014. Results. There were 16 (36 %) middle thoracic esophagus tumors and 28 (64 %) tumors of distal thoracic esophagus. Mean duration of the operation was 319 minutes (approximately five hours and 20 minutes). The average blood loss was 173. 6 ml. A total of 12 (27 %) of patients had postoperative complications and mean intensive care unit stay was 2. 8 days. Mean hospital stay after surgery was 16 days. The average number of harvested lymph nodes during surgery was 31. 9. The overall 30 -day mortality rate within 30 days after surgery was 2 %. Conclusion. As long as MIE is an oncological equivalent to open esophagectomy (OE), better relation between cost savings and potentially increased effectiveness will make MIE the preferred approach in high-volume esophageal centers that are experienced in minimally invasive procedures...|$|E

40|$|O objetivo desse estudo foi compreender os fatores determinantes da prática transfusional de concentrado de hemácias em cirurgias eletivas do aparelho digestivo em quatro unidades hospitalares em Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brasil. Foi realizado um estudo descritivo, analítico e retrospectivo através do levantamento de dados em prontuários clínicos de quatro unidades hospitalares de onde foram catalogados os dados de pacientes a partir de junho de 2007 a dezembro de 2008, referentes às cirurgias citadas. Os resultados evidenciaram 81 casos, sendo 42 % do gênero feminino e 58 % do masculino. A idade média foi de 55, 5 anos (± 19, 11 anos). As enfermidades de base reportadas mais comuns foram os processos neoplásicos (42 %). Desses 81 pacientes, 38 (47 %) foram hemotransfundidos no pré-operatório imediato, 28 (18 %) foram transfundidos no transcirúrgico e 37 (45, 7 %) no pós-operatório imediato. Na análise univariada houve diferenças entre a prática transfusional pré-cirúrgica interinstitucional. Na fase cirúrgica houve relação entre a prática transfusional com a citação de motivos, fator RH (Rhesus), prática institucional e doença de base. Na fase pós-cirúrgica não foram demonstradas relações. Em todas as fases, não houve associação da prática transfusional com os tipos de procedimentos cirúrgicos, com o índice ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) e valores de hemoglobina e hematócrito. Concluindo, esse estudo revelou que a prática transfusional foi heterogênea entre instituições hospitalares, careceu de valores laboratoriais específicos, relacionou-se com a patologia de base mas não com o tipo de procedimento cirúrgico e foi norteada pelo critério de escolha do profissional. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the determinative factors for packed red cell transfusions in elective <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgeries</b> in four hospital units in Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Retrospective analyses were performed by collecting data from the clinical records of patients submitted to elective <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgeries</b> from June 2007 to December 2008 at these four hospital units. Eighty-one cases (42 % females and 58 % males) were included in this study. The average age was 55. 5 years old (Standard deviation ± 19. 11 years). The commonest reported underlying disease was neoplasia (42 %). Of these patients, 38 (47 %) were transfused in the immediate preoperative period, 28 (34. 6 %) during the surgery and 37 (45. 7 %) in the immediate postoperative period. In the univariate analysis, there was an association between the data of transfusions and the different institutions. In the surgical phase, there were correlations between transfusion and the reason for transfusion, RH factor (Rhesus), institutional policy and the underlying disease. In the postoperative phase, no association was identified. In all phases, there were not correlations between the type of surgical procedures, ASA index (American Society of Anesthesiology), and hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the blood transfusions in elective <b>digestive</b> tract <b>surgeries</b> were heterogeneous between hospitals and were not related to specific laboratorial values; they were associated to the underlying pathology, but not with the type of surgical procedure and generally followed the criteria of the healthcare specialist...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Surgical site {{infections are}} a risk {{inherent}} to surgical procedures, especially after <b>digestive</b> <b>surgeries.</b> They occur up to 30 days after surgery, {{or up to}} a year later if a prosthesis is implanted. The Surgical-site Infection Risk Index (SIRI), NISS (National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance) methodology, is a method to evaluate the risk of surgical site infections, which takes into account the potential contamination of the surgery, the patient's health status and surgery duration. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the correlation between the surgical-site infection risk index score on the 1 st day postoperatively, and the development of surgical site infection up to 30 days postoperatively. METHODS: The postoperative surgical site infections (NNIS) was evaluated by following-up in hospital and as an outpatient. The patients followed prospectively were those submitted to elective surgeries, clean (hernioplasties) or contaminated (colorretal), performed by conventional approach at a university hospital, during the period from June 2007 to August 2008. The mean age of the patients was 55. 5 years, 133 (65. 5 %) male; 120 (59. 1 %) submitted to clean surgeries and 83 (40. 9 %) contaminated. RESULTS: The global index of surgical site infections was 10. 3 %; 10 (8. 3 %) in clean procedures and 111 (3. 2 %) in contaminated ones. Four (19. 1 %) of the surgical site infections were diagnosed at the time of hospitalization and 17 (80. 9 %) at post-discharge follow-up. Twelve (57. 1 %) of the surgical site infections were superficial, 2 (9. 5 %) deep and 7 (33. 3 %) at a specific site. Of these, 5 (6. 6 %) were in patients classified as SIRI 0 (76); 9 (15 %) for SIRI 1 (60); 5 (9. 1 %) for SIRI 2 (55) and 2 (16. 7 %) for SIRI 3. CONCLUSION: The global index of surgical site infections and its incidence among contaminated procedures are within the expected limits. On the other hand according to SIRI, the surgical site infection indexes are above the expected standards both for the clean and for the contaminated procedures...|$|R
