25|$|According to {{literary}} historian Mircea Martin, Georgescu {{was one of}} the intellectuals who, after the liberalization episode, were involved in the large debates over the interpretation of history and the nature of Romanian culture. In this interpretation, he stood among those who protected the ideals of Europeanism and cosmopolitanism, in the company of other communists dissatisfied with the official line (Crohmălniceanu, Savin Bratu, Vera Călin, Paul Cornea, Silvian Iosifescu), of former political prisoners of communism (Nicolae Balotă, Ovidiu Cotruş, Ştefan Augustin Doinaş, Adrian Marino, Ion Negoiţescu, Alexandru Paleologu), and of many younger figures who were <b>just</b> <b>making</b> their debut on the literary scene. This community, Martin notes, resisted the ethnic nationalism and Protochronism promoted with acquiescence from the regime, by such figures as Paul Anghel, Eugen Barbu, Edgar Papu, Mihai Ungheanu and Dan Zamfirescu. Paul Georgescu's contemporaries describe his enduring passion for ideological conflict. He believed Romanian literature itself to have been shaped by the conflict between two stances, both exemplified by 19th century authors: on one hand, the pessimistic and emphatic Mihai Eminescu; on the other, the sarcastic and often absurdist Ion Luca Caragiale.|$|E
25|$|The team ran the 1987 HDT VL {{during the}} 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship while the {{evolution}} car was homologated {{and prepared for}} later in the season.

Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne, both with long associations with TWR, joined the team for the Sandown 500, with Perkins and Hulme sharing a brand new Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV while Allam and Hahne drove Perkins old VL updated to TWR specs. Hahne, who in 1988 had been driving a Ford Sierra for Walter Wolf Racing in the European Touring Car Championship and the German DTM series, was a late replacement for Tom Walkinshaw, who was unable to drive as scheduled due to the death of his father. Perkins and Hulme had a strong race at Sandown, finishing second behind the Sierra of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford, while the Allam/Hulme car failed to finish.|$|E

Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E

500|$|Ants use {{pheromone}}s {{for more}} than <b>just</b> <b>making</b> trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use [...] "propaganda pheromones" [...] to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by {{a wide range of}} structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.|$|E
