500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it {{was an effort to}} force Cooder to focus on the project, [...] "He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> back in Havana." [...] Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Drake was {{featured}} in full-page interviews in the pop press. In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Sayers had {{the most}} {{productive}} rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers when he tore the ligaments in his right knee. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, [...] "I saw his eyes sort of glass over. I heard him holler. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hurt." [...] Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program {{with the help of}} Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears' final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, and UPI, and NEA.|$|E

500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E
500|$|The singer had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her paternal grandfather, Ron Cyrus, a Democratic legislator {{in the state of}} Kentucky and public servant, whom she referred to as [...] "Pappy". He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that develops from the protective lining that covers many of the body's internal organs, and struggled with the illness for several years as result of exposure to asbestos. Cyrus then relocated from Franklin, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California to commence work on the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. At the sight of her grandfather ailing from afar, Cyrus was inspired to compose [...] "I Miss You". In her autobiography Miles to Go (2009), she explained, [...] "That's how I ended up writing the song 'I Miss You' for Pappy. He was so sick. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying, and slowly so did my heart. I couldn't imagine life without him." [...] She co-wrote the song with her mother's dear friends Wendy Foy Green and Brian Green, and described it as the most difficult song for her write because of the subject matter. Cyrus attempted to halt writing [...] "I Miss You", telling her co-writers she could not bear anymore.|$|E
500|$|On November 5, California Chrome {{entered the}} Breeders' Cup Classic {{as a strong}} {{favorite}} over Travers Stakes winner Arrogate. [...] Chrome led from the outset, tracked by Arrogate. [...] The two horses engaged in the homestretch and in the final yards, Arrogate surged ahead to defeat California Chrome by a neck at the finish. The two horses dominated {{the remainder of the}} field by over 10 lengths. [...] Critics of the race and Espinoza himself speculated that the loss was because Espinoza had failed to make his move and establish a large enough lead earlier in the race. [...] Sherman also wondered if Espinoza could have opened up a bigger lead, but he was unsure if it would have mattered: [...] "That winner is the real McCoy, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the one we had to beat, but I didn't know how good he was," [...] he said. While the horse came out of the race in good shape, the press asked Raul Rodriquez if the horse [...] "knew" [...] that he had lost the race, and the groom replied, [...] "oh yeah." [...] Post race analysis gave California Chrome a Beyer Speed Figure of 119, the highest of his career, topped by 120 for Arrogate.|$|E

500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheen's {{breakthrough}} {{role was}} as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's The Deal. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown {{prior to the}} 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because [...] "he was in Mary Reilly and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> brilliant." [...] Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, [...] "It's interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders." [...] The Daily Telegraph praised his [...] "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" [...] while The Guardian found him [...] "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." [...] In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of [...] "treading a fine line" [...] because [...] "a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical". He {{was nominated for a}} BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction and produced and starred in The Banker, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of The UN Inspector, a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector. The Times wrote of [...] "a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance" [...] while Variety noted that the actor [...] "adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire". The Evening Standard, while conceding that the performance was [...] "technically brilliant", expressed bemusement as to why [...] "one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's 24 Hour Play, in which The Telegraph felt he [...] "dazzled". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors.|$|E

2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see me play... but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> watching me, and I never let him down." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you {{would learn to}} do battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't have to learn anything else." [...] It {{was his way of}} saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E
