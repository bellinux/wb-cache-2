40|$|We are {{interested}} in an automotive riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> located in the clutch system. After gearshift and during the clutch re-engagement, the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> allows to transmit a progressive torque through its axial stiffness. In order to ensure the stability of cushion curve during the lifetime of the system, we propose to perform a Finite Element model of the riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> The aim is to optimize the correlation between numerical and experimental results {{in order to obtain}} a prediction of contact pressures in the riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc.</b> This work will be the first step, leading to a framework for the drawing up of design rules for riveted <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> in term of stability. ...|$|R
