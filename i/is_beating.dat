5|$|Leigh has a {{professional}} rugby league team– Leigh Centurions– whose main {{claim to fame}} <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> Leeds 24–7 in the 1971 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium. The club played in the Super League in the 2005 season and was again promoted to the Super League in 2016, playing in 2017. Leigh has several amateur clubs, including Leigh East and Leigh Miners Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} round things started to get interesting. Amelita, David and Hayley took up the {{challenge}} in the Australian-themed episode. Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with your eyes and that <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E

25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and {{she is able to}} lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he <b>is</b> <b>beating.</b> Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E
500|$|... "Breathing" [...] {{is three}} minutes and fifty-four seconds long. It is a Eurodance song that {{displays}} influences of electro and house. [...] "Breathing" [...] {{is written in}} the key of B♭ minor and is set in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Derulo's vocal range spans from the note of F4 to the note of F6. The song features [...] "tribal vocal chorales" [...] in the background, and samples the song [...] "Pilentze Pee", which is sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. The song contains lyrical content about winning back a past love. [...] "Breathing" [...] opens with a [...] "slow build-up of synths and a quick club beat" [...] before Derulo sings: [...] "I only miss you when I'm breathing / I only miss you when my heart <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> / You are the color that I'm bleeding / I only miss you when I'm breathing." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted that {{he appears to be}} screaming the vocals during the chorus line: [...] "I only miss you when I'm breathing", writing that [...] "his final note [...] stretched out for several seconds".|$|E
500|$|Paleoconservative {{activist and}} former presidential {{candidate}} Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> the drums for warbut frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hunter {{called his}} dog {{and went into}} the forest. The {{chimpanzees}} fled as he approached, leaving behind them the drummer, caught in the trap with his drum. The hunter took the drum and brought it to the village. That is why the chimpanzees don't have drums anymore and why they beat their chests with their fists. That's why they say [...] "gugu". It isn't a real drum that we hear today, it is the chimpanzee who has stopped breathing and <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> his chest.|$|E
2500|$|Jacob's {{sons and}} their {{families}} join their brother, Joseph, in Egypt. [...] Once there, the Israelites begin to grow in number. [...] Several generations later, Egypt's Pharaoh, fearful that the Israelites could be a fifth column, orders that all newborn boys be thrown into the Nile. A Levite woman (identified elsewhere as Jochebed) saves her baby by setting him adrift on the river Nile in an ark of bulrushes. The Pharaoh's daughter finds the child, names him Moses, and brings him up as her own. But Moses is aware of his origins, and one day, when grown, he kills an Egyptian overseer who <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> a Hebrew slave and has to flee into Midian. There he marries Zipporah, the daughter of Midianite priest Jethro, and encounters God in a burning bush. Moses asks God for his name: God replies: [...] "I AM that I AM." [...] God tells Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Hebrews into Canaan, the land promised to Abraham.|$|E

2500|$|Paramedics in many jurisdictions {{administer}} {{a variety}} of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that <b>is</b> <b>beating</b> too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. [...] The list may include sympathomimetics like dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiogenic shock. Diabetics often benefit {{from the fact that}} paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They can treat crisis and anxiety conditions. Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, ketorolac. [...] This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.|$|E
