5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 8381 In {{recent times}} courts and legal {{scholars}} have paid increased {{attention to the}} concept of judicial deference. This thesis examines one discrete strand of the debate - judicial deference to legislative constitutional decision-making concerning fundamental human rights. It critically examines the role and practice of this kind of <b>deference</b> <b>in</b> constitutional jurisprudence and offers an account of what, it is argued, is the most defensible case for <b>deference</b> <b>in</b> the Irish constitutional order. It argues that there are difficulties with rationales which courts currently rely on <b>in</b> support of <b>deference.</b> However, it is argued that deference may be most defensible if Irish courts shift from deferring to hypothetical legislative constitutional decisions to affording <b>deference</b> only <b>in</b> cases where it can be shown that the legislature has offered express and publicly ascertainable justification for a particular constitutional decision. It is concluded that the presumption of constitutionality should be abandoned to facilitate this shift <b>in</b> orientation. <b>Deference,</b> it is argued, may be defensible where it is earned rather than where it is extended as a matter of course...|$|R

I initially present in Part II of this article an overview of Section 504 and Titles II and III of the ADA with particular emphasis on their effects on higher education and on judicial interpretations of the “otherwise qualified” standard. In the next section, I review the constitutional and common law principles that courts have relied on <b>in</b> granting <b>deference</b> to academic decisions. Part IV describes the approaches employed by the lower courts <b>in</b> giving <b>deference</b> to academic authorities when program modification claims arise under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. Finally, in Part V, I argue that deference to academic decisions is justified by the incompetence of courts to review academic standards...|$|R
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is {{believed}} that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.|$|E
