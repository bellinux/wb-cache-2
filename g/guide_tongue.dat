His major work was the Ductor in linguas (<b>Guide</b> into <b>tongues),</b> an eleven-language dictionary.

60|$|I {{have only}} to add, that I have {{selected}} the above from many anecdotes of Rob Roy which were, and may still be, current among the mountains where he flourished; but I am far from warranting their exact authenticity. Clannish partialities were very apt to <b>guide</b> the <b>tongue</b> and pen, {{as well as the}} pistol and claymore, and the features of an anecdote are wonderfully softened or exaggerated as the story is told by a MacGregor or a Campbell.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. It was in {{his mind}} to tell her of that evening at Clonarty, to speak of it, to recall that one wave of emotion on which, indeed, they might have floated into a {{completer}} understanding. He looked at her steadfastly. She was very graceful, very good to look upon. She sat upright in her poor cane chair, bending over her foolish little task. But he missed any inspiration which might have <b>guided</b> his <b>tongue.</b> She looked so thoroughly self-possessed, so splendidly superior to circumstances.|$|R
60|$|The {{road was}} smooth and dusty and descended rapidly, so that the horses {{had little to do}} but <b>guide</b> the <b>tongue.</b> As the wagon rocked and reeled past the ranch houses, the {{settlers}} had hardly time to discern what manner of man was driving, but they were thrown into fierce panic by the clatter of fleeing horses and the cloud of prophetic dust. The sheriff was not in sight, and no sound of him could be detected in the whiz of their own wheels.|$|R

The lightning has run masterless too long; He must to school and learn his verb and noun And teach his nimbleness to earn his wage, Spelling with <b>guided</b> <b>tongue</b> man's messages Shot through the weltering pit of the salt sea. And yet I marked, even in the manly joy Of our great-hearted Doctor in his boat (Perchance I erred), a shade of discontent; Or was it for mankind a generous shame, As of a luck not quite legitimate, Since fortune snatched from wit the lion's part? Was it a college pique of town and gown, As one within whose memory it burned That not academicians, but some lout, Found ten years since the Californian gold? And now, again, a hungry company Of traders, led by corporate sons of trade, Perversely borrowing from the shop the tools Of science, not from the philosophers, Had won the brightest laurel of all time. 'Twas always thus, and will be; hand and head Are ever rivals: but, though this be swift, The other slow,--this the Prometheus, And that the Jove,--yet, howsoever hid, It was from Jove the other stole his fire, And, without Jove, the good had never been. It is not Iroquois or cannibals, But ever the free race with front sublime, And these instructed by their wisest too, Who do the feat, and lift humanity. Let not him mourn who best entitled was, Nay, mourn not one: let him exult, Yea, plant the tree that bears best apples, plant, And water it with wine, nor watch askance Whether thy sons or strangers eat the fruit: Enough that mankind eat and are refreshed.|$|R

60|$|When {{they reached}} the little wind-swept village, it became evident that no shelter for the night could be found there, for it was seldom that even an enterprising {{pedestrian}} tourist {{came down from the}} high moors behind Crosbie Fell. Still, one inhabitant informed their <b>guide,</b> in a <b>tongue</b> none of the others could comprehend, that if he was in an unusually good humor old Musker, the keeper, might take them in at Crosbie Ghyll. Thus it happened that just as the rain began in earnest, such a cavalcade as had probably never before passed its gloomy portals rode up to the gate of the dilapidated edifice. Some of the iron-bound barriers still lay moldering in the hollow of the arch, and Helen noticed slits for muskets in the stout walls above, for the owners had been a fighting race, and several times in bygone centuries the tide of battle had rolled about and then had ebbed away from the stubbornly-held stronghold. The observer had gathered so much from a paragraph in her guide-book.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1960s, Keeling {{has been a}} keen {{advocate}} of the music of Robert Fripp and King Crimson. In 1999, Keeling was invited by Robert Fripp to arrange new versions of the King Crimson's music, {{as well as some}} of Fripp's solo guitar Soundscapes. Some of the resulting pieces have been performed, broadcast and recorded by The Metropole Orchestra of Amsterdam and there are plans for a CD release on Fripp's DGM label. Andrew Keeling is also co-author, together with Mark Graham, of A Musical Guide to King Crimson, a series of books, the first being [...] "Musical Guide to In The Court Of The Crimson King by King Crimson" [...] (...) published in August 2009. Musical <b>Guides</b> to Larks' <b>Tongues</b> in Aspic and In the Wake Poseidon follow with plans for further books in the series. He has also been a part-time lecturer at the University of Liverpool and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and performs in an improvisation duo with former King Crimson violinist David Cross. Their album English Sun was released in 2009.|$|R
40|$|D. Litt. et PhilThe primary aim of {{this study}} is to: assess the {{relevance}} of the Zulu first language syllabus in respect of its meeting the needs of pupils; investigate and discuss language teaching approaches that may be appropriate to Zulu first language teaching; establish if various types of language syllabuses can be integrated for the enhancement of effective language teaching; integrate teaching approaches. Method of investigation The main method of investigation used was the literature review. In this research {{the focus is on the}} theoretical treatises, the present syllabus as well as Zulu textbooks and methodology books used for language teaching. Only materials relevant to the study were selected, categorised and discussed systematically in detail under the topics such as: the role of linguistics in language teaching; language teaching syllabuses; learning styles and theories on language learning and teaching; methods of language teaching in the classroom. The findings were compared with other investigations in the same field of study and were applied to Zulu first language teaching. Findings In this thesis it is recognised that the methodology and approaches in the teaching of Zulu first language is inadequate, since it focuses primarily on theoretical intricacies of the subject. Grammar teaching is not utilised maximally because teachers are to adhere to the theoretical aspects of the subject at the cost of the development of communicative competence. In the teaching of languages such as English, the value of the teaching of grammar has been questioned in the course of time, but not so with Zulu first language. The focus in the traditional Zulu first language syllabus is on grammar teaching, it however, lacks proper application. In the light of the above it is clear that the traditional way of teaching Zulu first language is inadequate. The thesis will hopefully <b>guide</b> Zulu mother <b>tongue</b> teachers into acquiring adequate language teaching skills and techniques. Recommendations It is recommended that language teaching should break away from the methodology that does not apply to real-life situations and that language learning should be made useful to learners by applying it to develop their life-skills. Teachers should explain theoretical principles by using authentic or quasi-authentic texts or speech as the point of departure. In other words the theoretical principles should not be merely illustrated by isolated decontextualised examples. Language teaching should reflect on all four language skills, namely, listening, speaking, reading and writing. An integrated approach to language teaching will enhance the standard of Zulu first language teaching. Therefore, language teaching should not be confined to only one syllabus type, but various syllabus types should be integrated depending on the language need to be addresse...|$|R
