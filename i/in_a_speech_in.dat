President and Mrs. Nixon were welcomed home by vice president Gerald R. Ford, who flew from Washington. His daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower was also in attendance. Nixon resigned from office five weeks later.|$|E

25|$|On March 21, a Federal judge {{dismissed}} the relatives' petition for asylum {{which they had}} filed on behalf of Elián González. Lázaro vowed to appeal. On March 29, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas was joined by 22 other civic leaders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> downtown Miami.

25|$|A similar scene {{took place}} at British Columbia's Government House, when, in 2009, Shawn Atleo, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, {{presented}} Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, with a letter of complaint about the Crown's fulfillment of its treaty duties, and requested {{a meeting with the}} Queen. Prince Charles then added another dimension to the relationship between the Crown and First Nations when, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver, he drew a connection between his own personal interests and concerns in environmentalism and the cultural practices and traditions of Canada's First Nations.|$|E
25|$|The Tibetan {{independence}} movement {{is a movement}} for the independence of Tibet and the political separation of Tibet from China. It is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora in countries like India and the United States, and by celebrities and Tibetan Buddhists in the United States and Europe. The movement is {{not supported by the}} 14th Dalai Lama, who although having advocated it from 1961 to the late 1970s, proposed a sort of high-level autonomy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> Strasbourg in 1988, and has since then restricted his position to either autonomy for the Tibetan people in the Tibet Autonomous Region within China, or extending the area of the autonomy to include parts of neighboring Chinese provinces inhabited by Tibetans.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{raised about}} effects of {{coloured}} immigration in communities in his constituency {{played a part}} in his commentary. In March 1968, the month before the Rivers of Blood speech, he made his first public references to them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> Walsall, when he described the concern of an anonymous constituent whose daughter was the only white child in her primary school class and suffered bullying from non-white pupils. When Wolverhampton Express and Star journalists failed to find the child or the class, the paper's editor and a then personal friend, Clement Jones, challenged him, stating Jones himself had similar anonymous complaints that were traced to members of the National Front (NF). Powell would not accept the explanation and told Jones he had received 'bags of supporting mail' {{as a result of the}} Walsall speech.|$|E
25|$|Nasser's {{response}} was the nationalization of the Suez Canal. On 26 July, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria, Nasser gave a riposte to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced {{the name of}} Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to the day's closing price on the Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Many argued that this was also {{a violation of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements.|$|E
25|$|After {{an urgency}} {{motion of the}} Bavarian SPD party in the Bavarian Parliament, the Minister of Justice Beate Merk (CSU party) defended herself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> front of the Parliament on 15 December 2011 against the {{impression}} Mollath had been hospitalized due to his criminal complaint. The following day she was explaining through a spokesman, that the accommodation Mollaths in psychiatry was a consequence of his crimes and {{had nothing to do}} with his wife or his lawsuit against the bank. She said, Mollath harmed his wife with strangulation marks on the neck, large hematoma and a bleeding bite wound. He also stabbed dozens of car tires, including those on vehicles of the wife's lawyers. His accommodation was confirmed by the Federal court and is observed regularly. She defended herself against the allegations that the state prosecution had failed to act because of instructions from leading politicians. Thereupon, the state prosecutor himself directed some questions towards the HypoVereinsbank.|$|E

25|$|Though {{nothing new}} to the {{economic}} history of Argentina, he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred {{a great part of}} their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker Acindar, had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar. In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the advent of democracy under Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89) and into the economic crisis that surrounded the peso's last sharp devaluation in early 2002.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{described}} his policy over North Rhodesia (modern Zambia) as “incredibly devious and tortuous” but “easily the one I am most proud of”. Macleod's initial {{plan for a}} Legislative Council with an African majority (16 African members to 14 Europeans) was strongly opposed by Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation. After a long battle {{in the first half}} of 1961, and under pressure from cabinet colleagues, Macleod accepted Welensky's proposal for a council of 45 members, 15 of whom would be elected by a largely African electoral roll, 15 by a largely European roll, 14 by both rolls jointly (with a further stipulation that successful candidates had to gain at least 10% of the African votes and 10% of the European ones) and 1 by Asians. Macleod's role in these negotiations attracted damaging and much-remembered criticism of Macleod by the party grandee, the Marquess of Salisbury, who had resigned from a senior position in the Cabinet over Cyprus in 1957. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords on 7 March 1961 Salisbury denounced Macleod as “too clever by half” and accused him of bridge-table trickery. The new constitution, which was equally disliked by both Africans and Europeans, helped to weaken the Central African Federation, which was later wound up by Rab Butler at the Victoria Falls Conference on 5 July 1963.|$|E
