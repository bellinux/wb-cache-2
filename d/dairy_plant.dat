25|$|Certain breeds of cattle, {{such as the}} Holstein-Friesian, {{are used}} to produce milk, which can be {{processed}} into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a <b>dairy</b> <b>plant</b> for eventual sale of a dairy product. For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered {{at a young age}} to produce veal. They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK, Europe and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.|$|E

25|$|In 1966 over 30 local Creameries, {{created by}} local farmers, joined with other small rural {{co-operative}} societies throughout Kilkenny and from some neighbouring counties and, together with Unigate Limited support, formed the Avonmore Creameries Federation. Realising {{the benefits of}} increased scale and greater diversification in the 1960s, they saw {{the need for an}} amalgamation of many small, locally focused co-operatives across Ireland. It led to {{the construction of a new}} multi-purpose Avonmore <b>dairy</b> <b>plant</b> facility in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, a Plant they claimed was the biggest food processing facility in Europe at that time. Today that giant global entity is known as Glanbia. Glanbia has its origins in the Irish agricultural co-operative movement that evolved over the last century, ever since first Irish Co-operative in 1889, as founded by Horace Plunkett. Today Glanbia has operations in 34 countries and is exporting to more than 100 countries worldwide. Glanbia plc was then formed in 1997 out of the merger of Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc. Glanbia is ranked by revenue (2010 figures) in the top 100 Cooperatives, No 98 in the world and No 1 in Ireland by the International Co-operative Alliance, the global apex organisation of co-operatives worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Milk {{processing}} effluents typically {{present a}} considerable burden to the environemnt. The level of burden {{can be determined}} {{with the use of}} ATV (Allgemeine Technische Vertragsbedingungen), VDI (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure) and BAT (Best Available Techniques) standards, or via operational monitoring. Water emissions from <b>dairy</b> <b>plants</b> are associated with high water pollution costs. In our survey of <b>dairy</b> processing <b>plants,</b> we found water emissions in excess of ATV and BAT standard predictions. As <b>dairy</b> <b>plants</b> are usually connected to public sewer systems with centralized water treatment facilities, the economic viability of installing effective waste water pre-treatment plants is an important issue to examine. In Slovenia, <b>dairy</b> <b>plants</b> pay water pollution fees and contribute to clean-up costs in centralized water treatment plants. This regime is similar to that in many other European countries. A preliminary test of the efficacy of flotation pretreatment plants exhibited sufficient cleaning effects to reduce total anual burden by more than half. This level of cleaning efficiency could greatly lower the cost of water pollution. An investment in installing pretreatment plants under such conditions would likely become cost-effective in a few years...|$|R
