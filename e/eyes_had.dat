5|$|Some {{observers}} accused Kỳ and Thi {{of either}} allowing or deliberately orchestrating the plot to embarrass Khánh, portray themselves as heroes, and therefore gain prominence {{on the political}} stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based {{in the city of}} Đà Nẵng in I Corps, claimed Kỳ and Thi met with him {{a few days before the}} coup, and had discussed their plans for joining a coup against Khánh. At the subsequent military trial of Phát and Đức's faction, the plotters were acquitted. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Khánh rigged the trial so that Đức and Phát were acquitted so they would be used as a Catholic counterweight to the Young Turks faction of Kỳ and Thi, who in Khánh's <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> become increasingly strong and ominous. Khánh decided to build an alliance with the generals from Minh's junta by releasing them from house arrest and recalling them to active roles. However, Thi and Kỳ were aware of the motives for these moves and adjusted accordingly.|$|E

25|$|However, {{as police}} {{obtained}} confessions from suspects, bodies {{continued to be}} discovered, proving that the suspects who had confessed could not be the killer the police were seeking. On 30 October 1983 the eviscerated body of a 19-year-old prostitute, named Vera Shevkun, was found in Shakhty. Shevkun had been killed on 27 October. Although the mutilations inflicted upon Shevkun's body were otherwise characteristic of those found upon other victims linked to the unknown murderer, the victim's <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> not been enucleated or otherwise wounded. Two months later, on 27 December, a 14-year-old Gukovo schoolboy, named Sergey Markov, was lured off a train and murdered at a rural station near Novocherkassk. Markov was emasculated and suffered over 70 knife wounds to his neck and upper torso before being eviscerated.|$|E

Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>had</b> an encounter with Cobra Commander prior {{to the formation of}} Cobra, where Cobra Commander befriended Snake Eyes and tried to recruit him into murdering a judge. The judge had convicted Cobra Commander's older brother of arson and insurance fraud, resulting in the ruin of his brother's life, causing his spiral downward into alcoholism, and ultimately the car accident that claimed both his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Snake Eyes agreed to accompany Cobra Commander, but at the last minute refused {{to go along with the}} plan. Cobra Commander then killed the judge, and swore revenge against Snake Eyes, resulting in him hiring Firefly (who in turn subcontracted Zartan) to kill Snake Eyes while he was training with the Arashikage Clan.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} what {{followed}} during the students' clash with the police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the students because they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive them off {{to carry out the}} protests and then return to their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. His <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 {{feet down}} at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been covered by plasters.

500|$|The {{issue was}} {{resolved}} in November 2010 when a nest {{was found in}} the top of a rotting tree stump, [...] above ground level and [...] in from the edge of a dry swamp forest in Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park. The nest depression was [...] in depth, with a lower layer of small wood chips at its base and a lining of dead leaves. The egg shells were brownish-white with dark brown and black markings of different sizes. The two very young chicks were entirely covered in black down, contrasting with a white pollux (the equivalent of the thumbnail on a human hand) and pink index nail. The bill was black with a white tip, and the legs were black-streaked brown. The <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> grey irises and blue pupils. Rail chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, so the chicks were assumed to be only a day or two old.|$|E
500|$|After test-sculpting in Plasticine, {{the puppet}} heads were moulded on a {{silicone}} rubber base and made using fibreglass.

For previous series, puppet <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been sized {{out of proportion}} to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in Captain Scarlet, the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets. As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers". Since episodes of Captain Scarlet were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the Century 21 Studios, duplicates were made of the [...] "expressionless" [...] template of each main character. For the pilot episode, an [...] "agony" [...] head was specially sculpted for the Captain Scarlet puppet for a brief reaction shot of Scarlet's Mysteron double being shot by Captain Blue.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's {{executive}} {{officer on the}} USS PC-815, testified in 1984 that Hubbard had {{said that he had}} been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that his <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb go off in my face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted.

500|$|Using such a technique, in 1994 Walter Gehring {{found that}} the pax-6 gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as squid, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc. Biologists including Ernst Mayr had believed that <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy {{of different types of}} eye varies widely. For example, the fruit fly's compound eye is made of hundreds of small lensed structures (ommatidia); the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the retina, so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively [...] "upside-down"; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye [...] "the right way around". The evidence of pax-6, however, was that the same genes controlled the development of the eyes of all these animals, suggesting that they all evolved from a common ancestor. Ancient genes had been conserved through millions of years of evolution to create dissimilar structures for similar functions, demonstrating deep homology between structures once thought to be purely analogous. This has caused a radical revision of the meaning of homology in evolutionary biology.|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2012, undefeated seven-time world {{champion}} Floyd Mayweather, Jr. (41-0, 25 KO’s) {{announced that he}} would challenge Cotto for his WBA 'Super' light middleweight title at the MGM Grand on May 5, 2012. Mayweather took to twitter, [...] "I’m fighting Miguel Cotto on May 5th because Miss Pac Man is ducking me." [...] He also claimed to have offered Pacquiao a guaranteed $40 million, with $20 million upfront. The last time Mayweather fought at 154 pounds was in 2007, in his win against Oscar De La Hoya. Mayweather came in at 151, while Cotto came in at 154 pounds. The fight started off with Cotto establishing himself as the fight's aggressor, but with Mayweather winning the first two rounds using effective counter-punching and body movement to block most of Cotto's punches. However, in the third round Cotto seemed to successfully swarm Mayweather and land decent flurries to steal himself the round. Then from rounds 4-9 the action was closely contested, with both fighters using their partially contrasting styles in attempts to one-up the other. Ultimately though, Mayweather managed to adjust to Cotto's new rhythm of attacking in flurries and used his now-newly tweaked counter-punching style to win a lot of the final rounds, in what people thought had secured Mayweather the decision victory. Cotto had Mayweather against the ropes many times, resulting in some damage and a lot of bleeding from Mayweather's nose. Cotto's <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> some partial swelling. Mayweather won via unanimous decision with scores of 117-111, 117-111 and 118-110. The crowd booed loudly when the scores were read out.|$|E
