40|$|Abstract—In this paper, Harmonic {{analysis}} of 10 -year time series (1995 - 2005) NOAA/AVHRR yearly composite images is performed {{to develop an}} innovative technique for hotspot detection and land-features classification based on temporal changes in the NDVI and various AVHRR band values. NOAA/AVHRR images are used due to wide coverage, high frequency and <b>free</b> <b>acquisition</b> offered by NOAA/AVHRR sensors. Proposed algorithm consists of three steps: (1) preprocessing of NOAA/AVHRR images to correct geometric distortions and calibrate the data radiometrically, (2) detection of cloud and water pixels in the preprocessed image and application of harmonic analysis on 10 -years time series AVHRR images to produce phase and amplitude images, and (3) application of image processing techniques on the amplitude images of different bands to detect hotspots and classify the region of interest. The obtained {{results indicate that the}} proposed method can classify the region of interest successfully with through out greater than 91 % classification accuracy.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Military system acquisition management decisions {{can be both}} untimely and uninformed, according to the author, due to the adverse effects of communication breakdown and filtering of information. An acquisition group decision support system (AGDSS), defined in this thesis, seeks to maintain acquisition team integrity and provides the necessary information processing capacity to mitigate {{the impact of these}} effects. The combination of such key technologies as local area networks, word processing, graphics, data base management, and video conferencing, is employed, which can <b>free</b> <b>acquisition</b> team members of mundane paperwork and afford them extraordinary decision making capabilities. These capabilities promise to result in more timely and better informed decisions. An example is provided to illustrate the application of an AGDSS to an acquisition-related problem and to show the benefits that can be derived from the output of the AGDSS. Finally, a system-level specification describing the performance and interface requirements is presented. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|E
40|$|Doron and Kyrios (2005) have {{suggested}} that self-related constructs may be vulnerability factors {{for the development of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and associated cognitions, possibly including compulsive buying, hoarding, and materialism. The present study examined the relationship between self-related constructs (self-ambivalence and attachment uncertainty), compulsive acquisition, hoarding, and materialism. As predicted, self-ambivalence and uncertainty were correlated with materialism, compulsive hoarding, and compulsive buying, while compulsive acquisition of free things was correlated with uncertainty. Furthermore, self-ambivalence accounted for significant variance in all three possession-related variables even after controlling for depression and indecisiveness. Uncertainty accounted for significant variance in the compulsive acquisition of free things. Materialism exhibited high to moderate correlations with compulsive buying but low to moderate correlations with compulsive hoarding and no association with <b>free</b> <b>acquisition.</b> Lack of family warmth failed to correlate with acquisition variables but did correlate with depression. Overall, the findings supported the contribution of self-ambivalence and attachment patterns but not early family environment to the understanding of compulsive acquisition, particularly hoarding and buying problems...|$|E
40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing propulsion system concepts for human exploration. These propulsion concepts {{will require the}} vapor <b>free</b> <b>acquisition</b> and delivery of the cryogenic propellants stored in the propulsion tanks during periods of microgravity to the exploration vehicles engines. Propellant management devices (PMD's), such as screen channel capillary liquid acquisition devices (LAD's), vanes and sponges {{have been used for}} earth storable propellants in the Space Shuttle Orbiter and other spacecraft propulsion systems, but only very limited propellant management capability currently exists for cryogenic propellants. NASA is developing PMD technology as a part of their cryogenic fluid management (CFM) project. System concept studies have looked at the key factors that dictate {{the size and shape of}} PMD devices and established screen channel LADs as an important component of PMD design. Modeling validated by normal gravity experiments is examining the behavior of the flow in the LAD channel assemblies (as opposed to only prior testing of screen samples) at the flow rates representative of actual engine service (similar in size to current launch vehicle upper stage engines). Recently testing of rectangular LAD channels has included inverted outflow in liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. This paper will report the results of liquid oxygen testing compare and contrast them with the recently published hydrogen results; and identify the sensitivity of these results to flow rate and tank internal pressure...|$|E

40|$|Syftet med denna studie var att beskriva vad patienter med cancer i den palliativa fasen upplever att livskvalitet är utifrån fysiskt, psykiskt och socialt perspektiv. Sökning av de underlag som användes i studien gjordes i olika databaser som Medline (via pubmed), Science Direct och Academic Search Elite. Sökningarna gjordes med enkla sökord eller i kombination med varandra. De underlag som söktes begränsades med att vara skrivna på svenska eller engelska, vara publicerade mellan år 2000 - 2008, handla om vuxna patienter samt fri åtkomst via databasen i fulltext. Totalt 17 artiklar granskades, analyserades och sammanställdes sedan under de olika perspektiven: fysiskt, psykiskt och socialt. Resultatet visar att upplevelse av livskvalitet sker genom avsaknad av smärta. Smärta är det vanligaste upplevda fysiska symtomet hos patienter med cancer i den palliativa fasen. Ångest och {{depression}} är de psykiska symtomen som är starkt relaterad till försämrad upplevd livskvalitet hos patienter genom den hela palliativa fasen. Man kunde även se att en bra kommunikation och dialog mellan sjuksköterskor och behandlande läkare värderades högt av patienterna. Den palliativa fasen hos cancersjuka patienter präglades av att det sociala nätverket med familj och närstående fördjupades, vilket var en viktig del för att kunna göra ett avslut.   Nyckelord:  Palliative Care, Patient Satisfaction, Quality of life, Terminally Ill, Terminal Care. The {{purpose of}} this study was to describe the quality of life from a physical, mental and social perspective that cancer patients in the palliative phase experience. The search of the articles which were utilized in the study was made in different databases such as Medline (via pubmed), Science Direct and Academic Search Elite. The searches were made with simple key words or in combination with each other. Limits for the searches were put to the Swedish or English language, articles published between 2000 - 2008, adult patients as well as a <b>free</b> <b>acquisition</b> through the database in full-text. In total, 17 articles were scrutinized, analyzed and then compiled under different perspectives: Physical, mental, and social. The result showed that the experience of the quality of life occurs through lack of pain. Pain is the most common physical symptom experienced by cancer patients at the palliative phase. Anguish and depression are the physical symptoms that are strongly related to deterioration in the quality of life that the patients experience through the whole palliative phase. One could even notice that good communication and dialogue between nurses and doctors in charge were highly appreciated by the patients. The palliative phase with regard to cancer patients was characterized by the fact that the social network with their families and relatives was profoundly intensified, which was an important part in order to be able to bid them farewell.     Keywords:  Palliative Care, Patient Satisfaction, Quality of life, Terminally Ill, Terminal Care...|$|E
