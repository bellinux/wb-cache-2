5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the thin slot and grins.|$|E
2500|$|Ennis {{travels to}} meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his {{childhood}} bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt {{he thought he had}} lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fianc√© really loves her and she replies [...] "yes". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, [...] "Jack, I swear..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River's ambitious, {{sometimes}} neurotic junior police officer. Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not like {{to bring it up}} for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want to admit that she does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> her dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that [...] "a police officer should be respected by the community", to which Davis casually replies [...] "Who said that?" [...] Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don't spend much time together outside of work. In the episode [...] "Hook, Line and Sinker" [...] Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his [...] "sexy fish talk". After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in , Karen's husband {{is said to be a}} soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.|$|E
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. <b>He</b> returned; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the dead {{rhinoceros}} {{and at the}} hole in its throat; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the still smoking rifle.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, for Peter's eyes were staring more roundly than usual {{and the hand}} that fumbled at his locket trembled visibly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Aunt Hannah, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Irene; {{but most of all}} <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Mary Louise, who seemed to sense from his manner some {{impending}} misfortune.|$|R
60|$|James {{scarcely}} heard; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the floor, brooding sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> his daughter, stares {{all around}} him, closes his eyes, and lies slumbering on her arm.|$|E
60|$|BURGOYNE (rising in amazement). Satisfactory, sir! Satisfactory!! (<b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> {{him for a}} moment, {{and then}} adds, with grim intensity) I am glad you take that view of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{what they}} all say, but--I don't know.' <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> his old sword which is hanging on the wall. 'Dering, I feel as if I was needed somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every one?' ...|$|E
60|$|Kells's {{radiance}} fled, {{leaving him}} ghastly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Oliver.|$|R

60|$|It was the general-in-chief. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me, {{but said}} nothing.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Guppy {{has been}} biting his thumb-nail during this dialogue, {{generally}} changing the thumb {{when he has}} changed the cross leg. As {{he is going to}} do so again, he happens to look at his coat-sleeve. It takes his attention. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> it, aghast.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mary," [...] the {{botanist}} whispers {{with white}} lips, but <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> {{the form of}} the man. His face whitens, it becomes so transfigured with emotion that for a moment it does not look weak. Then I see that his thin hand is clenched.|$|E
6000|$|Then at the {{expression}} of his face one realises that a Modern Utopia will probably keep its more intelligent citizens for better work than inn-tending. He is evidently inaccessible to the idea we think of putting before him. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> us a moment, and then remarks, [...] "There's the book to sign." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her fixedly, seeming fearful and {{uncertain}} how to answer.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} his round eyes, playing with his locket.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke with}} girlish shyness, which {{increased}} as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|ANDERSON (quaintly). Then I shall go in my best coat, dear. (He {{turns to}} the press, {{beginning}} {{to take off his}} coat.) Where--? (<b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the empty nail for a moment; then looks quickly round to the fire; strides across to it; and lifts Richard's coat.) Why, my dear, it seems that he has gone in my best coat.|$|E
60|$|Even {{the long}} drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy's spirits. He {{is so low}} that he droops on the {{threshold}} and has hardly strength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece, painted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a charm. He recovers in a moment. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> it with uncommon interest; {{he seems to be}} fixed and fascinated by it.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{been like}} that ever since this morning. Mr. Fiorsen's been in more than once, ma'am, and the fact is, baby don't like it. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> her so. But this morning I thought--well--I thought: 'You're her father. It's time she was getting used to you.' So I let them be a minute; and when I came back--I was only just across to the bathroom--he was comin' out lookin' quite fierce and white, and baby--oh, screamin'! And except for sleepin', she's hardly stopped cryin' since." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Hare did not understand. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her unbelievingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her, {{trying to}} {{guess at the}} mystery of her thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver's brows went up, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{the row of}} solemn faces.|$|R
6000|$|He {{goes into}} the bedroom. CLARE gets up and stands by the fire, [...] looking round in a dazed way. She puts her hand up and [...] {{mechanically}} gathers together the violets in the little vase. [...] Suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole, and sinks down into [...] the armchair, which he must pass. There she sits, the violets [...] in her hand. MALISE comes out and crosses towards the outer [...] door. She puts the violets up to him. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> them, [...] shrugs his shoulders, and passes on. For just a moment CLARE [...] sits motionless.|$|E
6000|$|JONES. Fat lot o' things they've got 'ere! [He {{sees the}} crimson purse {{lying on the}} floor.] More cat's fur. Puss, puss! [He fingers it, drops it on the tray, and looks at JACK.] Calf! Fat calf! [He sees his own presentment in a mirror. Lifting his hands, with fingers spread, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> it; then looks again at JACK, {{clenching}} his fist as if to batter in his sleeping, smiling face. Suddenly he tilts the rest o f the whisky into the glass and drinks it. With cunning glee he takes the silver box and purse and pockets them.] I 'll score you off too, that 's wot I 'll do! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Florist, alone, thoughtfully {{turning over}} the papers on his counter: [...] "That is sdrainche that I mage that mistake about the attress! I can't find the oder one anwhere; and if I lost it, what am I coing {{to do with the}} rhoces the other lady ortert?" [...] He steps back and looks at his feet, and then stoops and picks up a paper, which he examines. [...] "Ach! here it iss! Zlipped down behindt. Now I don't want to get it mixed with that oder any more." [...] He puts it down at the left, and takes up the address for the young man's roses on the right; <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the two {{addresses}} in a stupefaction. [...] "That is very sdrainche too. Well!" [...] He drops the papers with a shrug, and goes on arranging the flowers.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her, {{and made}} {{as if to}} tear her hands from their hold.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her, with {{something}} of wonder {{and more of}} admiration in his look.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me with {{a hopeless}} {{expression}} upon his vacuous, good-natured, scrubby little face.|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Despondently.] All right, Ay tal him. [ANNA {{goes out}} the doorway on rear. CHRIS follows {{her out and}} stands on the deck outside for a moment looking after her. Then he comes back inside and shuts the door. He stands looking out of the window--mutters--"Dirty die davil, you." [...] Then {{he goes to the}} table, sets the cloth {{straight}} mechanically, picks up the newspaper ANNA has let fall to the floor and sits down in the rocking-chair. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the paper for a while, then puts it on table, holds {{his head in his hands}} and sighs drearily. The noise of a man's heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door. CHRIS starts, makes a move as if to get up and go to the door, then thinks better of it and sits still. The knock is repeated--then as no answer comes, the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears. CHRIS scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip. BURKE is dressed up--wears a cheap blue suit, a striped cotton shirt with a black tie, and black shoes newly shined. His face is beaming with good humor.] ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), {{but all of us}} shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you in the depths of Hertfordshire. The more you endeavour to indicate where Brighton is--when you have with the greatest difficulty remembered--the less the devoted father can be made to comprehend, and the more obtusely <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the prospect; whereby, being reduced to extremity, you recommend the faithful parent to begin by going to St. Albans, and present him with half- a-crown. It does him good, no doubt, but scarcely helps him forward, since you find him lying drunk that same evening in the wheelwright's sawpit under the shed where the felled trees are, opposite the sign of the Three Jolly Hedgers.|$|E
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> me, wondering how I come there, and I stare at him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|E
60|$|Squire Paget was dumbfounded. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Ralph {{as if the}} boy was an apparition.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{was still}} inarticulate. His face twitched, his eyes watered as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
