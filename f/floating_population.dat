40|$|Background: <b>Floating</b> <b>populations</b> {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} characterized as "the tipping point" for the HIV epidemic in China. This study aims to systematically summarize {{and assess the}} effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions in <b>floating</b> <b>populations</b> in China over the past decade. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in three international databases for literature published between 2005 and 2012 with condom use as the primary outcome, and knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention and stigma towards HIV-infected individuals as secondary outcomes. The impact of interventions on changing the primary and secondary outcomes was calculated by risk difference (RD). We also performed subgroup analyses and meta-regression based on different study characteristics, using Stata 12. 0, for the primary outcome. Results: Sixteen studies (out of 149) involved 19 different programs {{and a total of}} 10, 864 participants at entry from 11 provinces in China. The pooled effect estimate of all studies indicated that people participating in HIV-related interventions were 13 % more likely to use condoms (95 %CI: 0. 07, 0. 18), however, the effects on increasing condom use exhibited significant heterogeneity across programs (P< 0. 01, I 2 = 0. 93). The meta-regression results suggest that interventions have been significantly less successful in changing condom use in more recent studies (β, 0. 14; 95 %CI: 0. 01, 0. 27), adjusted for sexual relationship, study design and follow-up period. Regarding the secondary outcomes, HIV-related interventions were successful at improving knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention (RD, - 0. 26; 95 %CI: - 0. 36, - 0. 16 and RD, - 0. 25; 95 %CI: - 0. 33, - 0. 16, respectively), and decreasing stigma (RD, 0. 18; 95 %CI: 0. 09, 0. 27). Conclusions: The included studies between 2005 and 2012 indicate that HIV prevention interventions among Chinese <b>floating</b> <b>populations</b> in the past decade were only marginally effective at increasing condom use, but relatively successful at increasing HIV knowledge and decreasing stigma. To avert new infections, novel sexual risk-reduction interventions taking into account the changing socio-economic and cultural situation of Chinese <b>floating</b> <b>populations</b> are urgently needed...|$|R

If the employment of indigenous people is limited to the tourism industry and there is a lack of opportunity in other industries, the development of indigenous populations will be more limited (Schellhorn 2010).|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{the current}} system of {{circular}} migration of <b>floating</b> <b>populations</b> in China offers greater labor resources to coastal areas of high economic activity, but [...] "although labor productivity in migrant activities is higher than it is in local nonfarm sectors, the current economic cost of migration in China is so high as to significantly limit such reallocation.

[...] In other words, research done by Yaohui Zhao at Beijing University indicates that while economic theory demonstrates labor migration to increase efficiency due to the reallocation of labor, the economic cost of migration actually mitigates gains in efficiency enough that internal migration under the Hukou system results in financial and social losses instead of gains.|$|R

Methods: We systematically searched the English and Chinese literature on sexual risk behaviors published between January 1980 and March 2012 in PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). We included observational studies that focused on population groups other than commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients, and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) and quantitatively reported one of the following indicators of recent high-risk sexual behavior: premarital sex, commercial sex, multiple sex partners, condom use or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
