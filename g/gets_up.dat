The song begins {{to turn into a}} jam after about the first two minutes, prominently including a choir of singers chanting [...] "Bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up)</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance, dance, dance!

Like the amount of vocals, the amount of instrumentation increases significantly during this portion, but with John on piano, the piano is obviously the dominant instrument; there are three piano solos in the song. As a result of the musical free-for-all, the song is six minutes and forty-three seconds, making it one of John's longest.|$|R

Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays.

The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave.

Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E

Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return.

5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life.

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

40|$|Cattle have {{a species}} {{specific}} movement pattern when lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> They need sufficient space for {{their heads to}} perform these movements normally. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> behaviour of beef bulls at a Swedish farm operation. The hypothesis was that bulls older than 10 months (over approximately 400 kg) were disturbed by a horizontal front rail and that the time to lie down and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> differed from what can be regarded as normal based on earlier scientific studies. The bulls were Swedish Red and White (SRB), Swedish Friesian (SLB) or crossbreeds of these two, and were kept in a cubicle system with a stall front design where there was a horizontal rail 40 cm above the stall floor. The age of the bulls ranged from 4 to 18 months. A group consisting of 33 bulls with weights 424 - 615 kg was chosen for the study. During one week in July 2008, behavioural observations were made daily from 7. 30 to 11. 30 hrs. Thirty-one of the 33 bulls were observed when lying down or <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> The total number of observations for lying down was 175 and for <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> 157. The median total time for lying down was 27 s and for <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> 6. 9 s, including interrupted sequences. According to a separate regression analysis, body weight was not significantly associated with time for lying down (P> 0. 05). The recorded times for lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> corresponded well with other studies. The bulls had 21 % interrupted lying down and 3 % interrupted <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> behaviours. During 12 % of the <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> movements they were slipping, whereas this was not recorded during lying down. There were 3 recordings of abnormal lying down and 5 recordings of abnormal <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> The head was held over the rail during 38 % of the lying down movements and during 76 % of the <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> movements. In conclusion this study did not show any longer times for lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> in bulls with a head rail at 40 cm above the floor, but there were some interrupted lying down behaviours and slipping at <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> and the head position during these movements may be of importance...|$|R
