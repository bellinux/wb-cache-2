The objective of this work was to select sunflower cultivars adapted to this important production region.

Two criteria were used for selection of cultivars: i) the <b>general</b> <b>mean</b> obtained from different environments; ii) partitioning of <b>general</b> <b>mean</b> in favorable and unfavorable environments. Partitioning of the <b>general</b> <b>mean</b> allowed to detect the specific environment indicated for each cultivar. For grain yield, the cultivar Helio 251 presented general indication, Milênio and CF 17 could be indicated for favorable environments and ACA 884, ACA 885 and ACA 872 for the unfavorable ones. For oil yield, CF 13, Milênio, DK 4030, Helio 250 and ACA 872 had general indication; AG 966, GH 12, GV 26043, CF 17 and VDH 93 could be indicated for favorable environments, while VDH 488, Helio 251, ACA 884 and ACA 885 for the unfavorable conditions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose {{the use of an}} {{alternative}} methodology to track low incomes based on Atkinson`s (1970) family of "equally distributed equivalent income" functions, which are called "general means" here. We provide a new characterization of general means that justifies their use in this context. Our method of evaluating the effects of growth on poor incomes is based on a comparison of growth rates for two standards of living: the ordinary mean and a bottom-sensitive <b>general</b> <b>mean.</b> The motivating question is: To what extent is growth in the ordinary mean accompanied by growth in the <b>general</b> <b>mean?</b> A key indicator in this approach is the growth elasticity of the <b>general</b> <b>mean,</b> or the percentage change in the <b>general</b> <b>mean</b> over the percentage change in the usual mean. Our empirical analysis estimates this growth elasticity for a data set containing 144 household surveys from 20 countries over the last quarter century. Among other results, we find that the growth elasticity of bottom sensitive general means is positive, but significantly smaller than one. This suggests that the incomes of the poor do not grow one-for-one with increases in average income. ...|$|E
