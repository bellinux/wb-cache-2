500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E

2500|$|Captain Schettino stated that, before {{approaching}} the island, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> the alarm {{system for the}} ship's computer navigation system. [...] "I was navigating by sight, because I knew those seabeds well. I had done the move three, four times." [...] He told investigators that he saw waves breaking on the reef and turned abruptly, swinging {{the side of the}} hull into the reef. [...] "I have {{to take responsibility for the}} fact that I made a judgment error." [...] "This time I ordered the turn too late." [...] The captain initially stated that the ship was about [...] from the shore (about the length of the vessel) and hit an uncharted rock. However, the ship's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, told investigators that Schettino had left his reading glasses in his cabin and repeatedly asked Ambrosio to check the radar for him.|$|E

2500|$|John Fletcher, a 47-year-old {{delivery}} driver, {{was driving}} a white Mercedes van along the B1188 Sleaford road when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> along a disused road near Nocton, Lincolnshire. The road formerly led towards a bridge over a railway line; this bridge had been removed in 1968 and the approach to the line blocked by a brick wall. After travelling [...] along the road Fletcher's van smashed through the wall and fell [...] onto the railway, trapping him inside the vehicle. At 18:30, as Fletcher was talking on his mobile phone to an emergency services operator, the 15:42 service from Birmingham New Street station to [...] via Lincoln, a two-carriage Sprinter train (156409), impacted his van and shunted it [...] along the tracks. According to a police statement the van disintegrated into [...] "1,000 pieces if not more". Fletcher died of multiple injuries. The front carriage of the train was derailed, remaining upright. Fourteen of the train's forty-one occupants, including the driver, were taken to Lincoln County Hospital with minor injuries.|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles {{performed}} [...] "Get Back" [...] (along {{with other}} {{songs from the}} album) {{as part of the}} Beatles' rooftop performance, which took place on the roof of Apple Studios in Savile Row, London on 30 January 1969, an edited version of which was included in the Let It Be film. [...] "Get Back" [...] was performed in full three times. During the third, which marked the end of the rooftop performance, the Beatles were interrupted by the police who had received complaints from office workers nearby. After the police spoke to Mal Evans, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> Lennon and Harrison's amplifiers only for Harrison to switch them back on, insisting that they finish the song. It was during this period that McCartney ad-libbed, [...] "You've been playing on the roofs again, and that's no good, and you know your Mummy doesn't like that... she gets angry... she's gonna have you arrested! Get back!" [...] The third rooftop performance of [...] "Get Back" [...] is available on Anthology 3: the last song of the Beatles' final live performance.|$|E

50|$|In the 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, while {{traveling}} in a San Francisco city bus, Spock used the Vulcan neck pinch to subdue a punk traveler who rudely ignored Kirk's request that <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> his boom box as his music was causing the other travelers discomfort.

50|$|The film {{opens with}} Manchester Black {{watching}} news stories about villains and how they're given second chances.

When Manchester sees this, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the TV and begins his plot to keep the world safe by any means necessary.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{also had}} {{elements}} of horror. As did another Outer Limits story, [...] "The Borderland", it addressed {{the idea of}} an electronic limbo that exists when television signals cease transmission or are broadcast out into space, raising questions such as where the Galaxy Being goes when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the transmitter. This horror of oblivion was to occur in several other Outer Limits episodes.|$|R

50|$|Consider a lamp with a toggle switch. Flicking {{the switch}} once turns the lamp on. Another flick will <b>turn</b> the lamp <b>off.</b> Now suppose {{that there is}} a being able to perform the {{following}} task: starting a timer, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> the lamp on. At the end of one minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> it <b>off.</b> At the end of another half minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> it on again. At the end of another quarter of a minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> it <b>off.</b> At the next eighth of a minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> it on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.|$|R
50|$|Despondent, Cunningham {{insists that}} Giles open the vault and free his asphyx. Giles agrees, on the {{condition}} that Cunningham first grant him immortality.

The resulting explosion kills Giles and destroys all of the equipment required to capture asphyxes.|$|R

60|$|In one of {{his pockets}} he carried a piece of cake, and this he ate with {{satisfaction}} while undressing. Then, when clad only in his pajamas, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> the light and moved in the semi-darkness toward the bed.|$|E
50|$|Len {{is driving}} Mohammed's son Hassan {{back from a}} maths exam. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> down a track to {{investigate}} a column of smoke {{from the village of}} Deir Yassin.

50|$|The film {{opens with}} a boy waking from sleep {{in the middle of}} the night.

He walks to the living room, where the television is playing static. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the television and notices a red light emanating from his bedroom. He becomes afraid and runs to the closed door, yelling for his mother. A robed arm reaches towards him from his bedroom. The door slams.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for the song, {{directed}} by Tamar Simon Hoffs, features the band inside a car being driven around by a chauffeur, {{who appears to}} be unimpressed by the group (at one point <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the car radio, stopping the song). The car stops inside a tunnel and the girls walk towards the end of it, which cuts to the band playing and dancing over a red background. Leonard Nimoy played the part of the chauffeur; this came about due to Nimoy being a friend of Tamar and Susanna Hoffs' family.|$|R
