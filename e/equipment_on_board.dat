5|$|The Su-25UBM is a twin seat variant {{that can}} be used as an {{operational}} trainer, but also has attack capabilities, and can be used for reconnaissance, target designation and airborne control. Its first flight was on 6 December 2008 and it was certified in December 2010. It will enter operational use with the Russian Air Force later. The variant has a Phazotron NIIR Kopyo radar and Bars-2 <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Su-25UBM's range is believed to be 1,300km and it may have protection against infra-red guided missiles (IRGM), a minimal requirement on today's battle fields where IRGMs proliferate.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E

25|$|A new {{signalling}} system, {{supplied by}} Thales, {{will replace the}} current ageing signalling system on the North South Line. The upgrading works will be completed in phases from 2016. The upgraded signalling system will shorten waiting times as trains {{will be able to}} run closer to each other. The new system was expected to become operational from mid-March 2017. MRT trains were also progressively retrofitted with new <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to be compatible with the new signalling system.|$|E
25|$|When coupled, {{the power}} for the ramps, pumps, {{floodlights}} and other <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the barge is taken from the pusher. When the power cables on the starboard side of the pusher's superstructure are disconnected, a 200 kVA Volvo Penta TD100CRC generating set starts automatically and provides power to operate the equipment when the barge is left alone for loading or unloading. To increase maneuverability in ports the barges are equipped with a 680kW controllable-pitch bow thruster which is powered by the pusher's shaft generator.|$|E

25|$|The boilers of Tarmo were {{converted}} for {{heavy fuel oil}} in 1950, which increased her endurance from one week {{to more than one}} month in normal ice conditions and quadrupled her range. Furthermore, the number of stokers tending the boilers could be reduced from 15 to 9. Her superstructure was also expanded and the crew accommodation was brought up to modern standards. However, as late as in 1952 she still lacked a gyrocompass, echosounder and even a radar, all of which were standard <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the merchant ships she assisted during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|With {{less than}} a month's {{training}} behind her, Mathews departed Norfolk on 8 April 1945 for the Pacific with military cargo and passengers. Stopping briefly in Hawaii for further training, she steamed on to Eniwetok and Ulithi, arriving at the latter on 21 June. On 10 July, with Army passengers and <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> she sailed for Okinawa, which had recently been secured after 82 days of fighting. Mathews entered Hagushi Bay on 14 July, remaining until the 22nd when she departed for Ulithi. From there she carried cargo to Guadalcanal and Guam.

50|$|Two flying boats, the Boreas and the Passat, {{equipped}} with aerial photography <b>equipment</b> were <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ship Schwabenland. The {{application of this}} technology over Antarctica was revolutionary. Stereo photography was used. On {{the way back to}} Europe, the aircraft carrier conducted oceanographic, biological and meteorological observations and every fifteen to thirty minutes echo soundings were taken.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was an Ilyushin Il-76, a large Russian-built cargo aircraft. Registered as EW-78849, the Il-76 {{had been}} on a chartered cargo flight carrying equipment to Ugandan AMISOM peacekeepers in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. All of the crew members were Belarusian. Four of the personnel on board the accident aircraft were engineers who had worked on repairing another aircraft of the same type that had been the subject of an attempted shootdown 14 days earlier. Much of the <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> EW-78849 was for repairing the aircraft damaged earlier; the rest of the cargo was humanitarian aid. The first aircraft was still crippled at the departure time of EW-78849, and TransAVIAexport were considering whether to cannibalise it for re-usable parts.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed that it probably started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
500|$|From its {{beginning}} in the early 1930s, the LFR was augmented with Low Frequency Non-directional beacons (NDBs). [...] While the LFR required a complex ground installation and only a simple AM receiver on board the aircraft, NDB ground installations were simple single-antenna transmitters requiring somewhat more complex <b>equipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the aircraft. [...] The NDB's radio emission pattern was uniform in all directions in the horizontal plane. The NDB's on-board receiver was called a radio direction finder (RDF). [...] The NDB-RDF combination allowed pilots to determine the direction of the NDB ground station relative to the direction the airplane was pointing. [...] When used in conjunction with the on board magnetic compass, the pilot could navigate to or from the station along any chosen course radiating from the station.|$|E
