40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{mathematics}} based approaches have been widely adopted in various image restora-tion problems, among which the partial differential equation (PDE) based approach (e. g. the total variation model [56] and its generalizations, nonlinear diffusions [15, 52], etc.), and wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach are some of successful examples. These approaches were developed through different paths and generally provided understandings from different angles of the same problem. As shown in numerical simulations, implementa-tions of wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach and PDE based approach quite often end up with solving a similar numerical problem with similar numerical behaviors, even though different approaches have advantages in different applications. Since wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> and PDE based approaches have all been modeling {{the same type of}} problems with success, it is natural to ask whether wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach is fundamentally connected with PDE based approach when we trace {{all the way back to}} their roots. A fundamental connection of a wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach with total variation model and its generalizations were established in [8]. This connection gives wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach a geometric explanation and, at the same time, it equips a PDE based approach with a time frequency analysis. It was shown in [8] that a special type of wavelet frame model using generic wavelet frame systems can be regarded as an approximation of a generic variational mode...|$|R
40|$|Applications of wavelet frames {{to image}} {{restoration}} problems (e. g. image deblurring and inpainting) {{have been successful}} due to their redundancy and capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions like images (see e. g.

Recently in [6], connections between one of the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> image restoration model [8, 28, 48] and variational models (e. g. the ROF model [45]) were rigorously established. Such connections not only grant new insights to wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> image restorations, it also case a geometric explanation to wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches. This leads us to a wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> model, as well as a fast algorithm, to reconstruct implicit surfaces from unorganized point sets in R 3. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model using several commonly used examples...|$|R

40|$|Theory of wavelet {{frames and}} their {{applications}} to image restoration {{problems have been}} extensively studied {{for the past two}} decades. The success of wavelet frames in solving image restoration problems, which includes denoising, deblurring, inpainting, computed tomography, etc., is mainly due to their capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions such as images. However, in contrast to the wide applications of wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches to image restoration problems, they are rarely used for some image/data analysis tasks, such as image segmentation, registration and surface reconstruction from unorganized point clouds. The main reason for this is the lack of geometric interpretations of wavelet frames and their associated transforms. Recently, geometric meanings of wavelet frames have been discovered and connections between the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach and the differential operator based variational model were established. 1 Such discovery enabled us to extend the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach to some image/data analysis tasks that have not yet been studied before. In this paper, we will provide a unified survey of the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> models for image segmentation 2 and surface reconstruction from unorganized point clouds. 3 Advantages of the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach are illustrated by numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The variational {{techniques}} (e. g., {{the total}} variation based method [1]) are well established and effective for image restoration, {{as well as}} many other applications, while wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach is relatively new and came from a different school. This paper is designed to establish a connection between these two major approaches for image restoration. The main result of this paper shows that when spline wavelet frames of [2] are used, a special model of a wavelet frame method, called the analysis based approach, {{can be viewed as a}} discrete approximation at a given resolution to variational methods. A convergence analysis as image resolution increases is given in terms of objective functionals and their approximate minimizers. This analysis goes beyond the establishment of the connections between these two approaches, since it leads to new understandings for the both approaches. First, it provides geometric interpretations to the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approach as well as its solutions. On the other hand, for any given variational model, wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches provide various and flexible discretizations which immediately lead to fast numerical algorithms for both the wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches and the corresponding variational model. Furthermore, the built-in multiresolution structure of wavelet frames can be utilized to adaptively choose proper differential operators in different regions of a given image according to the order of the singularity of the underlying solutions. This is important when multiple orders of differential operators are used in various models that generalize the total variation based method. These observations will enable us to design new methods according to the problems at hand, hence, lead to wider applications of both the variational and wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches. Links of wavelet <b>frame</b> <b>based</b> approaches to some more general variational methods developed recently will also be discussed. 1...|$|R
