5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E

5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E

There would have been no need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone.

The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E

He began his review with the statement [...] "Once you reach the level of intellectual maturity where {{you can tell the}} difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair", and continued in the same fashion throughout. Pearson likened Johns to Kurt Cobain, saying they share a common inability; [...] "his inability to write lyrics".

Despite other reviewers' claims that the capsule system contributed to the game's dependence on chance, IGN commended the system for contributing to a more dynamic game board experience. The [...] "Super Duel" [...] mode was praised as a reasonably fun feature, although the gameplay was rated as [...] "sluggish".

Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying, [...] "It's easy to see the great ideas from previous songs at work here, {{but there seems to}} be an intentional restraint placed on the band's likeable pop inclinations." [...] The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett's performance, saying [...] "his voice is too drearily clean-cut to deliver a true emotional punch." [...] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork felt that the album was hampered by the band's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them, saying that [...] "Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To Loyalty <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> their detractors can say the same thing." ...|$|E

[...] Thompson explained that the disease had afflicted his family as well as millions of others and stated that [...] "there's no candidate in either party more prepared and more motivated to lead this effort than me." [...] He compared the announcement to President Kennedy's pledge to put {{a man on the moon}} before the end of the 1960s. The plan consisted of increases in funding for cancer research, including a doubling of the National Institute of Health's budget and additional incentives for private medical professionals to find a cure. Furthermore, Thompson remarked that as part of the plan, he would travel the world to promote cures, improving the United States' international standing. David Miller of CBS News questioned whether the announcement was [...] "a desperate measure by a desperate candidate, or a well-thought out policy by a former Health and Human Services secretary." [...] He added, [...] "we can't say for sure, but this item <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> it did succeed in drawing attention to the other Thompson in the race." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Volk, [...] "The basic {{tenet of}} {{what we might call}} Manilius' natural {{philosophy}} is the idea that the universe is divine". With that said, she contends that the poet is inconsistent {{when it comes to the}} location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims that the perfectly regular movement of the heavenly bodies <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the universe is the product of a god, but at the same time he asserts that the universe itself is also a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum). Later in the same book, Manilius once again argues that the universe is the [...] "work of a great divinity" [...] (magni ... numinis ordo). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes: [...] "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?" [...] Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, [...] "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [...] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god." [...] According to Volk, this interpretation of the universewhich states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly waythus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect impacting everything within the cosmos, [...] and that fate rules all.|$|E

500|$|After The Dark Knights success, Warner Bros. signed Nolan {{to direct}} Inception. Nolan also wrote and co-produced the film, {{described}} as [...] "a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within {{the architecture of}} the mind". Before being released in theaters, critics like Peter Travers and Lou Lumenick wondered if Nolan's faith in moviegoers' intelligence would cost him at the box office. Starring a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film was released on 16 July 2010, and was a critical and commercial success. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a perfect score of [...] "A+" [...] and called it [...] "one of the best movies of the [...] century." [...] Mark Kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating [...] "Inception <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing." [...] The film ended up grossing over $820million worldwide and was nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture; it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Nolan also received BAFTA, Golden Globe, DGA and PGA Award nominations, as well as a WGA Award for his work on the film. While in post-production on Inception, Nolan gave an interview for These Amazing Shadows (2011), a documentary spotlighting film appreciation and preservation by the National Film Registry. He also appeared in Side by Side (2012), a documentary about the history, process and workflow of both digital and photochemical film creation.|$|E

However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being {{better than the other}} ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly in control of the dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command!

The performance received positive reviews from critics. Jon O'Brien from AllMusic commented that [...] "the euphoric glittery disco of [...] "All the Lovers", [...] benefit from a live setting." [...] Dawn Collinson from Liverpool Echo praised the encore segment and its visuals, saying [...] "All The Lovers took Aphrodite to an incredible climax."

[...] Minogue performed [...] "All the Lovers" [...] as part of her seven song set at the closing ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. That same year, on the Kiss Me Once Tour, [...] "All The Lovers" [...] was the second-to-last performance of the show and featured confetti cannons raining down upon the audience. It was also included on Minogue's 2015 Summer Tour, where she performed dressed in a glittery red mini dress. Most recently, it was performed on Minogue's Kylie Christmas concert series. On 22 June 2010, American pop group Scissor Sisters performed a country-inspired version of [...] "All the Lovers" [...] on the Live Lounge segment of the British radio station BBC Radio 1.
