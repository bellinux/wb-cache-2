500|$|Preston Wong from Hampton Roads said, [...] " [...] giv riders a {{sense of}} {{vulnerability}} and, {{for those in the}} front row, an idea of what it must <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> fly" [...] and that enthusiasts would like the ride. Nicole Paitsel, Lisa Deaderick, and Joe Atkinson from Daily Press each rated the roller coaster for its vomiting and scream factors. Nicole and Lisa rated the vomiting factor a one (out of five) for the roller coaster's smoothness; Joe gave a four as he began feeling ill after his second ride. For the scream factor Nicole gave a five, Lisa gave a ten, and Joe gave a four. Mike from NewsPlusNotes praised the first drop for its freefall experience.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with {{a pretty good idea of}} what it would <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E
500|$|... "What's It <b>Feel</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> Be a Ghost?" [...] is, {{according}} to Lazzara, about a [...] "pre-pre-midlife crisis." [...] Mascherino {{said that the}} song [...] "charges forward," [...] never letting [...] "up and fully rocks the entire time." [...] Rubano called the opening guitar riff [...] "not quite 'Paradise City', but it's a guitar riff where when we first came up with it, we were like, 'Whoa! Rock! He thought that [...] "Liar (It Takes One to Know One)" [...] sounded like a modern equivalent of the Police. Lazzara called the song [...] "110 miles-per-hour, very hard to play and totally rocking," [...] and Mascherino considered it and [...] "Spin" [...] the group's fastest songs ever. [...] "MakeDamnSure" [...] has a phone message in the bridge; Lazzara and his girlfriend were arguing at the time, and she left him a message. Lazzara showed it to Valentine, wanting to include it in the song. He called [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] "laid-back." [...] According to Mascherino, [...] "MakeDamnSure" [...] received the greatest group effort of the album's songs.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1997 South Park episode [...] "Death," [...] Stan's {{grandfather}} locks Stan in a {{room and}} plays a parody of the song performed by Toddy Walters to illustrate what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be old.|$|R

2500|$|A lot of {{historical}} films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia page to you onscreen, like just reciting [...] "and {{then he did}} that, and then he did that, and then he did this other thing" [...] – it's like a [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] compilation. We wanted the movie to be emotional and passionate. Our goal was to give you [...] "What does Alan Turing feel like?" [...] What does his story feel like?

2500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz, in his {{positive}} {{review of}} the film, observed how [...] "t's less interested in a giant monster's rampage than in what it might <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a tiny human watching it close up, or far away, or on TV. It is not about Godzilla or the beasts he fights .... it's a combination epic horror film and parable of nature in revolt, filled with odd ellipses and surprising but appropriate storytelling choices, such as an early monster duel that plays out mainly on CNN." [...] In regards to the film's shallow characters, [...] "the film is inclined {{to see them as}} representatives of an endangered species rather than complex individuals". He also noted in the film [...] "a touch of Terrence Malick's Transcendentalist humility in how the director lavishes attention on meadows and forests and rolling waves", with the film's final shot evoking The Thin Red Line (1998).|$|E

5000|$|Rick Cohoon of Allmusic {{gave the}} song a {{favorable}} review. He stated {{in his review}} that Wayne [...] "sends this one right to the pit of our stomachs, {{as we all know}} what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> struggle for equilibrium after a breakup." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{was only}} {{this morning that}} I was reading in the {{newspaper}} all sorts of nice things about you.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{almost as}} bad," [...] she cried with vehemence, and Ditmar, stopped {{suddenly}} in his pacing as by a physical force, {{looked at her}} with the startled air of the male who has inadvertently touched off one of the many hidden springs in the feminine emotional mechanism. [...] "How {{do you know what it}} is to live in a squalid, ugly street, in dark little rooms that smell of cooking, and not be able to have any of the finer, beautiful things in life? Unless you'd wanted these things as I've wanted them, you couldn't know. Oh, I can understand what it would <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> strike, to wish to dynamite men like you!" ...|$|E

You crossed Sloane Square, turned up King's Road, and finally arrived here. I followed. I saw a notice up, [...] "Studio to Let". I {{reflected}} that, having done a little painting in an amateur way, I could pose as an artist all right; so I took the studio. Also the name of Alan Beverley. My own is Bill Bates. I had often {{wondered what it would}} <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be called by some name like Alan Beverley or Cyril Trevelyan. It was simply the spin of the coin which decided me in favour of the former. Once in, the problem was how to get to know you. When I heard you playing I knew it was all right. I had only to keep knocking on the floor long enough--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{did just}} splendidly, Anne," [...] puffed Diana, {{recovering}} sufficiently {{to sit up}} and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word. [...] "Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago--it {{came out on the}} afternoon train, you know, and won't be here till tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon and all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty well--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through with three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as if she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see your name {{at the head of a}} pass list like that? If it were me I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you're as calm and cool as a spring evening." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} write about love because it is the one thing that we all {{identify}} with. Everyone knows what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be with someone you love, and to fall out of love. You suffer because of love and then love makes you happy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Morning {{and evening}} we work away pretty stiff. It is {{infantry}} drill we have. They {{say we are}} not going to fight on the camels, but only to be carried along by them and to get off and fight if we see the enemy, and as we are all new to each other there is a good bit of work to be done to get us down to work as one battalion. We and the 4th make a troop together. We have drill in the afternoon, too, for a bit. Of a morning those that like can go across and have a look at the town. I went yesterday. Rum old place, isn't it? The rummiest thing is the way those little donkeys get about with a fat chap perched on the top of a saddle two feet above them. Never saw such mokes in my life. They ain't bigger than good-sized dogs some of them, and yet they go along with fifteen or sixteen stone on their backs as if they did not feel it. Those and the camels pleased me most. Rum beasts those camels. I can't think what it must <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be stuck up on top of them, and if one does fall off it must be like coming off a church. Have you tried one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, yes, I too {{could talk}} like that--I, writer of books, {{to the young}} lad, sick of his office stool, dreaming of a {{literary}} career leading to fame and fortune. [...] "And do you think, lad, that by that road you will reach Happiness sooner than by another? Do you think interviews with yourself in penny weeklies will bring you any satisfaction after the first halfdozen? Do you think the gushing female who has read all your books, and who wonders what it must <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be so clever, will be welcome to you the tenth time you meet her? Do you think press cuttings will always consist of wondering admiration of your genius, of paragraphs about your charming personal appearance under the heading, 'Our Celebrities'? Have you thought of the Uncomplimentary criticisms, of the spiteful paragraphs, of the everlasting fear of slipping a few inches down the greasy pole called 'popular taste,' to which you are condemned to cling for life, as some lesser criminal to his weary tread-mill, struggling with no hope but not to fall! Make a home, lad, for the woman who loves you; gather one or two friends about you; work, think, and play, that will bring you happiness. Shun this roaring gingerbread fair that calls itself, forsooth, the 'World of art and letters.' Let its clowns and its contortionists fight among themselves for the plaudits and the halfpence of the mob. Let it be with its shouting and its surging, its blare and its cheap flare. Come away, the summer's night is just {{the other side of}} the hedge, with its silence and its stars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be suicidal, and I know what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, {{and then the next}} thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|R
