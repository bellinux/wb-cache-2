40|$|We {{explore the}} dynamic {{evolution}} {{of property rights}} regimes in R&D alliances using the incomplete contract approach pioneered by Grossman, Hart, and Moore. In contrast to the standard analysis, the productive asset is an excludable public good such as a patent. Moreover, both firms can decide whether to disclose their know-how and invest effort. Know-how that has once been released cannot be concealed later. We characterize different scenarios in which the optimal ownership structure may change over time due to a trade-off between inducing <b>know-how</b> <b>disclosure</b> and ensuring maximum effort...|$|E
40|$|In general, the {{disclosure}} of know-how and technological knowledge could harm the disclosing firm. Firms, however, often share their know-how freely and yet enhance their profits. We provide a theoretical framework and a new insight into <b>know-how</b> <b>disclosure.</b> We consider a multiproduct oligopolistic market in which an incumbent firm that can disclose its cost-reducing know-how and several new entrants exist. Each firm supplies products in two separate markets. The incumbent firm has already allocated its production resources to one market (market A) and discloses its know-how concerning production in market A. We show that {{the disclosure}} of know-how for cost reduction can enhance the profit of the incumbent (the disclosing) firm. Using the disclosed know-how, the entrants can produce for a low cost in market A and allocate their production resources to the other market. As a result, competition in market A is less severe than {{that in the case}} in which the incumbent does not disclose its know-how. We also provide several extensions of the basic scenario...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{agreements}} associated with the transfer of <b>know-how</b> agreement:(a) the <b>disclosure</b> and (b) the non-disclosure agreements which are not separately parts of the principal know-how agreement.|$|R
