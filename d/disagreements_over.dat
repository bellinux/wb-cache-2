5|$|The {{moral and}} ethical {{questions}} raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.

5|$|After Parker {{was hired}} to direct the film, Gerolmo had {{completed}} two drafts. Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion's offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director however had repeated <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> {{the focus of the}} story. To resolve the issue, Orion executives in New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand then {{attempted}} {{to facilitate a}} fusion between the Romanian National Party and the National Liberals, but negotiations broke down after <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> the possible leadership. Eventually, Brătianu convened with Ferdinand his return to power, and the king called on Foreign Minister Take Ionescu to resign, thus causing a political crisis that profited the PNL {{and put an end}} to the Averescu cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kaspersky made a {{decision}} against taking the company public, saying it would make decision-making slow and prevent long-term R investments. This led {{to a series of}} high-level departures from the company, including his ex-wife and co-founder. Another series of departures occurred in 2014 due to <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> how to run the company.|$|E

5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. <b>Disagreements</b> <b>over</b> the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E

5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating {{in the formation of the}} Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the {{explosive}} trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. <b>Disagreements</b> <b>over</b> and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E

5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> the asking price. The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that <b>disagreements</b> <b>over</b> how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

In July, he cancelled Thunderbirds after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer. The three major US networks of the time– NBC, CBS and ABC– had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price. When NBC withdrew its offer, the other two immediately followed.|$|E
