The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832.

5|$|Former WWF Champion Randy Savage was {{the last}} wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were {{eliminated}} in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal Rumble match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named {{the winner of the}} 1993 Royal Rumble match.

5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head.

However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E

Ramon threw Hart with a fallaway slam and applied a bear hug. Hart escaped the hold by biting Ramon. He threw Ramon {{out of the ring}} and performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second rope. Hart applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, but Ramon grabbed the ropes, which forced the referee to instruct Hart to break the hold. Hart threw Ramon with a belly-to-back suplex, but Ramon responded by attempting to perform the Razor's Edge, his signature move. Hart reversed this into an unsuccessful pin attempt. With both men exhausted, Hart applied the Sharpshooter and won the match by forcing Ramon to submit.|$|E
