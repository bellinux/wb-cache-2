5|$|Secretariat's first {{official}} foal crop, arriving in 1975, consisted of 28 foals, {{the best of}} which was Dactylographer, who won the William Hill Futurity in October 1977. The <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> also included Canadian Bound, who at the 1976 Keeneland July sale was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier, selling for $1.5 million. Canadian Bound, however, was a complete failure in racing, and for several years, the value of Secretariat's offspring declined considerably, especially given the rising popularity of Northern Dancer's offspring in the sales ring.|$|E
5|$|Sold for US$300,000 to a {{breeding}} syndicate led by Leslie Combs II, Shannon was retired to stud duty and stood alongside another Australian champion Bernborough at Combs' Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, {{where he had}} a successful career as a sire. Eleven of his <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> yearlings averaged $11,755 each. The best of his progeny were Clem ($535,681) who defeated Round Table in track record time in the Washington Park Handicap, and Sea O Erin ($407,259), who won the Citation Handicap and 18 other races. Shannon sired the winners of more than $4 million {{while he was at}} stud in Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the album}} had been {{composed}} and committed to demo form before the band arrived at Rundgren's studio, but the producer felt that the <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> was insufficient. He expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready, whereas the Furs believed that their creative process had always flourished best inside a studio. He postponed recording while the Furs made additional demos. British keyboardist and future music producer Ed Buller helped to create many of the demos made before the band returned. Although never an official member of the Furs, Buller supplied much-needed musical accompaniment at this stage, and {{would go on to}} collaborate frequently with the band over the next six years. When the second batch arrived, Rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely. By necessity then, some songs were revised or fully composed in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> of foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a horse that was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E
25|$|Nyquist is {{from the}} <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> of Uncle Mo, and is the first foal out of Seeking Gabrielle. Helped by Nyquist's earnings, Uncle Mo led the 2015 {{freshman}} sire list in America, setting an earnings record. Uncle Mo also sired several other stakes winners in the <b>first</b> <b>crop,</b> two of which joined Nyquist {{in the field for}} the 2016 Kentucky Derby.|$|E

25|$|Giri {{completed}} his initial {{education at the}} Khallikote College in Berhampur. In 1913 he went to Ireland to study law which he did at University College Dublin and the Honourable Society of King's Inns, Dublin between 1913–1916. Giri was one among the <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> of thirteen Indian students who sat the obligatory year long course at UCD in 1914–15. This was a requirement for being called to the Irish Bar through study at the King's Inns. In total, 50 Indian students studied at UCD between 1914 and 1917.|$|E

25|$|Like most temperate-latitude trees, cherry seeds require {{exposure}} to cold to germinate (an adaptation which prevents germination during the autumn, {{which would then}} result in the seedling being killed by winter temperatures). The pits are planted in the autumn (after first being chilled) and seedlings emerge in the spring. A cherry tree will take {{three to four years}} in the field to produce its <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> of fruit, and seven years to attain full maturity. Because of the cold-weather requirement, none of the Prunus genus can grow in tropical climates.|$|E
25|$|Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 {{to making}} the <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> circles in South England. When some people refused to believe them, they {{deliberately}} added straight lines and squares {{to show that they}} could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.|$|E
25|$|March 2016, Tweed Farms is now {{licensed}} to produce, possess and ship dried marijuana at its facilities in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. The license completes a successful phase of infrastructure enhancements that {{have increased the}} independence of the Tweed Farms site and transformed it from a broad-scale production facility to a vertically integrated campus capable of growing, trimming, curing and storing product. A 25,000 sq. ft. processing and storage building has been added to the existing 350,000 sq. ft. greenhouse. Tweed Farms will seek a final sales license as soon as its <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> has been harvested and tested for sale.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{situation}} of farm mechanization in rice production. Factors affecting labor productivity in rice production, both <b>first</b> and second <b>cropping</b> seasons in 2010 / 2011, was analyzed using quantile regression and ordinary least square models. The results reveal that increasing farm size would increase labor productivity in both <b>first</b> and second <b>cropping</b> seasons while laborsaving technology would increase labor productivity only in the <b>first</b> <b>cropping</b> season. Thus, increasing farm size, investment {{in research and development}} of labor-saving technology, and supporting the appropriate use of labor-saving technology will improve labor productivity in a labor shortage situation...|$|R

25|$|On May 27, 2014, the University of Kentucky {{planted the}} second legal hemp crop in Kentucky. The <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> plot was planted earlier in May {{of the same}} year at Murray State University using California seeds. With these plantings, Kentucky became the first state in America to begin hemp production. Katie Moyer, a farmer in Christian County raising hemp, boasted that hemp crops stop soil erosion. In 2015, Kentucky's Department of Agriculture {{received}} 326 applications. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for approving applications. All applicants must submit a business plan, as well as pass a background check to appease the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).|$|E
25|$|Short-term dwarfing {{of foliage}} can be {{accomplished}} in certain deciduous bonsai by partial or total defoliation of the plant partway through the growing season. Not all species can survive this technique. In defoliating a healthy tree of a suitable species, {{most or all of}} the leaves are removed by clipping partway along each leaf's petiole (the thin stem that connects a leaf to its branch). Petioles later dry up and drop off or are manually removed once dry. The tree responds by producing a fresh crop of leaves. The new leaves are generally much smaller than those from the <b>first</b> <b>crop,</b> sometimes as small as half the length and width. If the bonsai is shown at this time, the smaller leaves contribute greatly to the bonsai aesthetic of dwarfing. This change in leaf size is usually not permanent, and the leaves of the following spring will often be the normal size. Defoliation weakens the tree and should not be performed in two consecutive years.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch {{was from}} the <b>first</b> <b>crop</b> of Joe Patchen, {{one of the fastest}} pacers of his time. Joe Patchen's main rival was Star Pointer, the first Standardbred to break the two minute barrier. Joe Patchen was a {{great-grandson}} of Standardbred foundation sire Hambletonian (known more fully as Hambletonian 10 or Rysdyk`s Hambletonian to distinguish him from the Thoroughbred of the same name). Hambletonian sired 40 trotters who met the standard, with several going on to be influential sires. His son George Wilkes raced for twelve years, winning 29 of 67 races. Known for his ill temper, he was initially greeted with indifference at stud but soon became one of the greatest sires of his age. One of George Wilkes's less distinguished sons was Patchen Wilkes, who barely met the standard with a best time of 2:29. Patchen Wilkes's only important offspring was a colt produced by the Morgan mare Josephine and named Joe Patchen after his parents. Though his breeding was suspect, Joe Patchen was a great pacer with a career best of 2:01. Other than Dan Patch, he was not a great success at stud.|$|E
