40|$|This {{engineering}} evaluation compares five alternative {{schemes for}} maintaining emergency annulus pumping equipment in a reliable condition. The five schemes are: (1) continue status quo; (2) periodic pump removal and run-in; (3) periodic in-place limited maintenance; (4) uninstalled ready spares; and (5) expanded mission of Single-Shell Tank Emergency <b>Pumping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> Each alternative is described, {{the pros and}} cons identified, and rough order of magnitude life-cycle costs computed. The alternatives are compared using weighted evaluation criteria. The evaluation concludes that staging adjustable length submersible pumps in the Single-Shell Tank Emergency <b>Pumping</b> <b>Trailer</b> has the best cost-benefit characteristics...|$|R
50|$|A Variable Speed (VFD) <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controller is a <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> {{controller}} that {{is able to}} {{vary the}} speed of the motor depending on the demand of the <b>fire</b> <b>pump,</b> resulting in the ability to hold a constant discharge pressure. It differs from other industrial variable speed control devices because it is now considered a life safety device, and so must adhere to the more rigid standards set forth by NFPA-20.|$|R
5000|$|A jockey pump is a pump {{connected}} to a fire sprinkler system and is intended to maintain pressure in a fire protection piping system to an artificially high level so that the operation of a single fire sprinkler will cause a pressure drop which will be sensed by the <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> automatic controller, causing the <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> to start. The jockey pump is essentially {{a portion of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>pump's</b> control system.A jockey pump is sized for a flow less than the flow to one sprinkler in order to ensure a system pressure drop. Hence a jockey pump {{is an important part of}} the <b>fire</b> <b>pumps</b> control system.Jockey pumps are typically small multistage centrifugal pumps, and do not have to be listed or certified for fire system application. The control equipment for jockey pumps may however carry approvals.Jockey pumps should be sized for 3% of the flow of the main <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> and to provide 10psi more pressure than the main <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> (As per Code IS 15105 : 2002) ...|$|R
5000|$|Variable Speed <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controllers {{were invented}} and {{released}} with a UL Listing for <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> service in 2003 by Master Control Systems, Inc. Paragraph 10.5.5 in the 2003 edition of NFPA-20 recognized Variable Speed as an accepted method for operating the <b>fire</b> <b>pump.</b> Then in the NFPA-20 2007 edition, section 10.10 {{was added to}} clarify and enhance the previous standards. In addition to reading these standards, a detailed summary of them by James S. Nasby of Columbia Engineering {{can be found on}} slides 7-11. In 2008 Master Control Systems, Inc. became the first company to provide FM Approval for the controller. A full list of companies with FM Approval may be found here. [...] Variable Speed <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controllers are now accepted by NFPA-20, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and most recently Factory Mutual (FM) for <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> applications.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a part}} of a fire {{sprinkler}} system's water supply and powered by electric, diesel or steam. The pump intake is either connected to the public underground water supply piping, or a static water source (e.g., tank, reservoir, lake). The pump provides water flow at a higher pressure to the sprinkler system risers and hose standpipes. A <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> is tested and listed for its use specifically for fire service by a third-party testing and listing agency, such as UL or FM Global. The main code that governs <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> installations in North America is the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 20 Standard for the Installation of Stationary <b>Fire</b> <b>Pumps</b> for <b>Fire</b> Protection.|$|R

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>pumping</b> {{systems are}} often used for {{firefighting}} {{in the majority of}} buildings, can they be residential, commercial, industrial or any other type. These systems are responsible for the needed water flow and pressure on manual or automatic devices installed for building protection purposes. Thus, {{it is very important to}} assure their availability when an undesirable fire event occurs. This paper focuses <b>fire</b> <b>pumping</b> systems' availability when they are submitted to regular periodic inspections or tests. These inspections or tests are performed to observe the system behavior and detect potential hidden failures of some component or subsystem. The methodology proposed in this paper is focused in the first stage on the analysis of the probability of failure on demand of critical equipment and analyzing the probability of success of this important stage. It is also shown the influence of inspection or tests frequency on the desired availability of the <b>fire</b> <b>pumping</b> system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
