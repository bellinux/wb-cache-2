5|$|The Northern Epirote {{representatives in}} the {{following}} Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino {{had to take the}} final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> accept the Protocol. The Protocol was eventually accepted after the intervention of Venizelos; however the representatives of Himara found the terms too humiliating, arguing that the only viable solution would be union with Greece and not autonomy inside the Albanian state.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{financial problems}} with Seattle Transit put the Blue Streak program in jeopardy, leading to calls {{to suspend the}} program before it launched. Service was originally slated to begin in 1968, and delays led {{to the federal government}} establishing a deadline in early 1969 for a city <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> move forward. A park and ride lot in Northgate was secured in August 1969, settling the demands of the federal government. The United States Department of Transportation approved $2 million in operating funds for Blue Streak in January 1970, providing two-thirds of the system's operating budget for {{the first two years of}} service.|$|E

5000|$|A {{model with}} a dummy {{dependent}} variable (also known as a qualitative dependent variable) {{is one in which}} the dependent variable, as influenced by the explanatory variables, is qualitative in nature. Some decisions regarding 'how much' of an act must be performed involve a prior <b>decision</b> making <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> perform the act or not. For example, the amount of output to produce, the cost to be incurred, etc. involve prior <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> produce or not, <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> spend or not, etc. Such [...] "prior decisions" [...] become dependent dummies in the regression model.|$|R
5|$|The <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> surgically {{decompress}} the {{pituitary gland}} {{is complex and}} mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery {{is most likely to}} improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, {{the second}} stage in the legal process began when both Carrouges and Le Gris, with their followers, {{presented}} themselves before the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de Justice to issue the formal challenge. This involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight. The declarations were pronounced {{in front of the}} King, his brother Louis of Valois and the entire Parlement, who decided to initially hear the case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> permit the judicial duel until both sides had given testimony. Attempts had been made to persuade Le Gris to insist on a church trial, but these proved unsuccessful as Le Gris wished to counter the accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40,000 livres for defamation. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris.|$|E

The agreement intended to feed Alliance Air's operations with both Air Tanzania and Uganda Airlines domestic and regional services.

25|$|The MP {{introducing}} {{the bill will}} generally make a recommendation that the bill be considered by an appropriate Select Committee (see below).

The House then votes {{as to whether the}} bill should be sent to the Committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the Select Committee stage even by parties which do not support it — since Select Committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> back a bill until the Second Reading.|$|E

Decisions regarding ICU admission are currently not based on scientific evidence, yet refusal is associated with increased mortality.|$|R
25|$|Admiral of the Fleet Sir (George) Rodney Mundy, GCB (19 April 1805 – 23 December 1884) was a Royal Navy officer. As a commander, {{he persuaded}} the Dutch to {{surrender}} Antwerp during the Belgian Revolution and then {{acted as a}} mediator during negotiations between the Dutch and the Belgians to end hostilities. As a captain, he was deployed to the East Indies Station and was asked to keep the Sultan of Brunei in line until the British Government made a final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> take the island of Labuan: he took the Sultan's son-in-law, Pengiran Mumin, to witness the island's accession to the British Crown in December 1846.

Gitlow considered this an unfortunate turn of events, as he sought freedom to continue his political activities without the constraint of parole supervision and the threat of a rapid return to jail. Gitlow's wife received word by telephone at that time that his <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> accept a parole was moot, however, as the Governor had decided to grant him a full pardon. Freed from jail the next day, Gitlow arrived by train to a packed Grand Central Station, where he received a rousing hero's welcome from the assembled party members and friends.|$|E

Mundy was asked to keep the Sultan of Brunei in line until the British Government made a final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> take the island of Labuan: he took the Sultan's son-in-law, Pengiran Mumin, to witness the island's accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846.

25|$|In November 2006, declaring {{satisfaction}} with the F-35's progress to date, the government gave 'first-pass' initial approval to the project under which F-35s will be acquired, deferring to late 2008 a <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> actually order the aircraft. Following this initial approval, on 13 December 2006 Australia signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which commits Australia to {{the next phase of}} the F-35's development. In October 2006 the deputy chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn, publicly stated that the RAAF had considered suitable aircraft which could be acquired if the F-35 was delayed, but that such aircraft were not believed to be necessary {{on the basis of the}} F-35 program's progress at the time. Concerns over the F-35 delivery schedule developed in Australia during 2007. In February the defence minister announced that a risk mitigation strategy, which involved obtaining F/A-18F Hornets, was being developed to prevent a gap in the RAAF's air combat capability if the F-35 program was delayed. This strategy was adopted, and an order for 24 F/A-18Fs was announced on 6 March 2007. The first aircraft was delivered in 2009 and the first squadron was declared operational in December 2010.|$|E
