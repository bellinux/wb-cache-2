40|$|Six leucine auxotrophic {{strains of}} the white rot {{basidiomycete}} Phanerochaete chrysosporium were characterized genetically and biochemically. Complementation studies involving the use of heterokaryons identified three leucine complementation groups. Since all of the leucine auxotrophs grew on minimal medium supplemented with α-ketoisocaproate {{as well as with}} leucine, the transaminase catalyzing the last step in the leucine pathway was apparently normal in all strains. Therefore, the wild-type, auxotrophic, and several heterokaryotic strains were assayed for the activities of the other enzymes specific to leucine biosynthesis. <b>Leu</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 4 strains (complementation group I) lacked only α-isopropylmalate synthase activity; <b>Leu</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 6 strains (group III) lacked isopropylmalate isomerase activity; <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 5 strains (group II) lacked β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.

Here, we present a straightforward method for their stereospecific solid-state NMR assignment based on [2 - 13 C]Glucose ([2 - 13 C]Glc) as the sole carbon source during protein expression. The approach is fundamentally based on the stereo-selective biosynthetic pathway of Val <b>and</b> <b>Leu,</b> <b>and</b> the co-presence of [2 - 13 C]pyruvate produced mainly by glycolysis and [3 - 13 C]/[1, 3 - 13 C]pyruvate most probably formed through scrambling in the pentose phosphate pathway.

40|$|Improving {{the amino}} acid (AA) {{profile of the}} diet by using l-Lys, l-Thr, dl-Met, l-Trp and l-Val helps to reduce the dietary CP content, thereby {{reducing}} nitrogen excretion while maintaining the performance of pigs. Valine is the fifth limiting AA in cereal–soybean meal-based diets. The {{extent to which the}} CP content in the diet can be reduced further without compromising performance depends on the requirement of the next limiting AA. In cereal–soybean meal-based diets, Ile, His <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> may be the limiting AAs after Val, although information on the requirements for these AAs is scarce. Six experiments were conducted to determine the effect of supplementing a low-CP diet with l-Ile, l-His and l-Leu on the performance of pigs weighing 10 to 20 kg. Experiment 1 was designed to determine the most limiting AA with respect to performance among Ile, His <b>and</b> <b>Leu.</b> A diet 10 % deficient in Ile, <b>Leu</b> <b>and</b> His relative to the National Research Council (NRC, 1998) requirement estimates tended to decrease daily feed intake and daily gain by 6 % and 8 %, respectively. A 10 % deficiency in His alone had no effect, whereas a 10 % deficiency in Ile or Leu slightly reduced daily feed intake and gain. In the remaining experiments, the standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ile : Lys, His : Lys <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> : Lys requirements were estimated. In Experiments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, 14 blocks of six pigs each were assigned to six levels of SID Ile : Lys (40 %, 43 %, 46 %, 49 %, 52 % and 55 %), His : Lys (20 %, 24 %, 28 %, 32 %, 36 % and 40 %), His : Lys (21 %, 24 %, 27 %, 30 %, 33 % <b>and</b> 36 %), <b>Leu</b> : Lys (70 %, 78 %, 86 %, 94 %, 102 % and 110 %) <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> : Lys (80 %, 90 %, 100 %, 110 %, 120 % and 130 %), respectively.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{we showed}} that the amino acid at {{position}} 61 in TM 1 of human P-glycoprotein is important in deciding the substrate specificity of this protein. In this work, we investigated whether the amino acids other than His 61 in TM 1 of P-glycoprotein are also essential in the function of this protein. Nine amino acids residues, from Ala 57 to Leu 65 in TM 1, were independently substituted to Arg, and analyzed the drug resistance of cells stably expressing each of these mutant P-glycoproteins. The mutant P-glycoproteins Ile 60 →Arg, His 61 →Arg, Ala 63 →Arg, Gly 64 →Arg, <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 →Arg were normally processed and expressed in the plasma membrane. Substrate specificities of mutant P-glycoproteins Gly 64 →Arg <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 →Arg were quite {{different from that of}} the wild type, and similar to that of the His 61 →Arg mutant, while the Ile 60 →Arg and Ala 63 →Arg mutant P-glycoproteins showed similar substrate specificities to that of the wild-type P-glycoprotein, suggesting that not only the amino acid residue at position 61 but also those at position 64 and 65 are also important in deciding the substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein. These three amino acids His 61, Gly 64, <b>and</b> <b>Leu</b> 65 would form a compact region on an α-helix arrangement of TM 1.

A positive n-π^* CD band at ∼ 225 - 230 nm appears to be characteristic of this structure.

In the cyclic disulfide series the Pro-Aib and Pro-D-Ala peptides favor type I 1 β-turns, whereas all other peptides adopt type I (111) conformations. All the cyclic disulfides exhibit an intense negative CD band at ∼ 228 - 230 nm.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements for branched-chain amino acids of 9 wild strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and 23 wild strains of L. lactis subsp. lactis in chemically defined media were investigated. Twenty-ninewild strains {{grew in the}} absence of lle, 14 {{in the absence of}} <b>Leu,</b> <b>and</b> none in the absence of Val. However, 15 wild strains grew in the absence of Ile <b>and</b> <b>Leu,</b> 2 in the absence of lle and Val, 2 in the absence of <b>Leu</b> <b>and</b> Val, and 13 in the absence of lle, <b>Leu</b> <b>and</b> Val. When 6 collection strains of L. lactis were cultured under the same conditions, the only growth recorded was that of 2 strains in the medium lacking lle. Sensory characteristics of lactococci were studied in small cheeses made using each strain as starter culture. The 7 L. lactis strains auxotrophic for Ile produced cheeses of standard odour, whereas the 14 strains prototrophic for Leu produced cheeses of abnormal odour. Out of 17 strains prototrophic for lle <b>and</b> auxotrophic for <b>Leu,</b> only 4 strains produced cheeses of standard odourPeer reviewe...|$|R

From an {{abbreviation}} of leeuwendaalder come the names of three present-day Balkan currencies, the Romanian <b>and</b> Moldovan <b>Leu</b> <b>and</b> the Bulgarian Lev.|$|R
40|$|General-purpose yeast {{expression}} vectors for convenient cloning {{and production of}} proteins with N- or C-terminal His 6 tags that can be efficiently removed with thrombin have been developed. To the parental yeast-E. coli shuttle vectors that have convenient copper-inducible expression, two selectable markers <b>and</b> <b>LEU</b> 2 d vector amplification, this development adds substantial versatility to product recovery...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{order and}} {{orientation}} in the leu-pyrA {{region of the}} Salmonella typhimurium linkage map was established by phage P 22 -mediated transductions. The gene order, in counterclockwise orientation, is leuO-leuA-leuB-leuC-leuD-ara-fol-pyrA. The fol locus is co-transducible with either the ara <b>and</b> <b>leu</b> loci or the pyrA locus, whereas no co-transduction for the ara and pyrA loci can be found...|$|R
