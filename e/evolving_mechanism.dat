40|$|The {{combinatorial}} optimization problem always is ubiquitous in various applications {{and has been}} proved to be well known NP-hard problem that classical mathematical methods cannot solve within the polynomial time. To solve it, many approaches {{have been developed to}} find best or near best solutions. As one of such approaches, genetic algorithm is well known as being able to find satisfied solution within acceptable time, it is controlled by <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> to achieve optimization searching in the solutions space. In this paper, we propose a new <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> for GA to improve the solution quality and searching efficiency as well. This <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> can extract a generalized pattern from elite individuals in the whole population. The pattern is used to determine the selection probability to experience the genetic operations such as crossover, mutation, replication, etc. moreover, the <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> includes a replacement mechanism to substitute the worse individual for the potential excellent individual to expand searching space. The computation results show that the proposed <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> can work effectively and find satisfactory solutions better than traditional evolving mechanisms, even though the solution space increases with the problem size.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in neuroscience is how {{structure and function}} of neural systems are related. We study this interplay by combining a familiar auto-associative neural network with an <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the birth and death of synapses. A feedback loop then arises leading to two qualitatively different behaviours. In one, the network structure becomes heterogeneous and dissasortative and the system displays good memory performance. In the other, the structure remains homogeneous and incapable of pattern retrieval. These findings are compatible with experimental results on early brain development, and provide {{an explanation for the}} existence of synaptic pruning. Other evolving networks [...] such as those of protein interaction [...] might share the basic ingredients for this feedback loop, and indeed many of their structural features are as predicted by our model...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} this paper is to examine the integration of biometric technology into healthcare’s information technology systems. Biometric technology, a rapidly <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> analyzes specific anatomical and physiological features of an individual for identity verification (Perrin, 2002). Moreover, as the federal government has mandated all health records to be electronic in 2014, the implementation of biometrics has become a prevalent means of security. In an effort to adhere to the patient privacy laws authorized by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), biometric recognition is currently used to restrict access to verified health care providers and detect fraudulent account access. This paper considers the advantages, disadvantages, and ethical consequences of utilizing biometric technology to secure the electronic health record in regards to cost, usability, accessibility, and accuracy. In addition to evaluating the primary application, the essay acknowledges the potential use of biometric technology to identify patients by vasculature scanning in the future...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid male {{sterility}} (HMS) is a rapidly <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> of reproductive isolation in Drosophila. Here we report a genetic analysis of HMS in third-chromosome segments of Drosophila mauritiana that were introgressed into a D. simulans background. Qualitative genetic mapping {{was used to}} localize 10 loci on 3 R and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) procedure (multiple-interval mapping) was used to identify 19 loci on the entire chromosome. These genetic incompatibilities often show dominance and complex patterns of epistasis. Most of the HMS loci have relatively small effects and generally {{at least two or}} three of them are required to produce complete sterility. Only one small region of the third chromosome of D. mauritiana by itself causes a high level of infertility when introgressed into D. simulans. By comparison with previous studies of the X chromosome, we infer that HMS loci are only approximately 40 % as dense on this autosome as they are on the X chromosome. These results are consistent with the gradual evolution of hybrid incompatibilities as a by-product of genetic divergence in allopatric populations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Standard Model {{of physics}} {{is built on}} the {{fundamental}} constants of nature, {{but it does not}} provide an explanation for their values, nor requires their constancy over space and time. Here we set a limit on a possible cosmological variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ by comparing transitions in methanol observed in the early Universe with those measured in the laboratory. Based on radio-astronomical observations of PKS 1830 - 211, we deduced a constraint of ∆µ/µ = (0. 0 ± 1. 0) × 10 - 7 at redshift z= 0. 89, corresponding to a look-back time of 7 billion years. This is consistent with a null result. Main Text: The Standard Model of particle physics, the theory describing symmetries and forces of nature at the deepest level, does not provide an intrinsic explanation for the values of the fundamental coupling constants, nor does it prohibit that the fundamental constants depend on time and space. In contrast, Einstein’s Equivalence Principle, a basic assumption of General Relativity, assumes that the laws of nature, and hence the fundamental constants are independent of a local reference system. Some cosmological scenarios aimed at explaining the fine-tuning between fundamental constants sketch an <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> where minimally varying constants are crucial for reaching the present state of complexity in the Universe (1).

40|$|The {{transition}} to selfing in Capsella rubella accompanies its recent divergence from the ancestral outcrossing C. grandiflora species about 100, 000 years ago. Whether {{the change in}} mating system was accompanied by the evolution of additional reproductive barriers that enforced species divergence remained unknown. Here, we show that C. rubella and C. grandiflora are reproductively separated by an endosperm-based, non-reciprocal postzygotic hybridization barrier. While hybridizations of C. rubella maternal plants with C. grandiflora pollen donors resulted in complete seed abortion caused by endosperm cellularization failure, the reciprocal hybridization resulted {{in the formation of}} small seeds with precociously cellularized endosperm. Strikingly, the transcriptomic response of both hybridizations mimicked respectively the response of paternal and maternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting unbalanced genome strength causes hybridization failure in both species. These results provide strong support for the theory that crosses between plants of different mating systems will be unbalanced, with the outcrosser behaving like a plant of increased ploidy, evoking a response that resembles an interploidy-type seed failure. Seed incompatilibity of C. rubella pollinated by C. grandiflora followed the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, involving negative genetic interaction of multiple paternal C. grandiflora loci with at least one maternal C. rubella locus. Given that both species only recently diverged, our data suggest that a fast <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> underlies the post-zygotic hybridization barrier(s) separating both species...|$|E

Experiments {{show that the}} water proton spin-lattice relaxation rate in chloroplast thylakoid membrane suspensions {{can be used to}} monitor membrane-bound manganese. Tile relaxation effect is reduced to 0. 4 of its original value upon manganese extraction by washing with either alkaline Tris buffer or NH 2 OH/EDTA solution. Large increases in the proton relaxation rate are measured in the presence of reductants such as tetraphenylboron a d NH 2 OH; oxidants uch as potassium ferricyanide or 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindo-phenol ead to a decrease in this rate. These results uggest that manganese exists as a mixture of oxidation states in dark-adapted chloroplasts. Even though a considerable amount of kinetic information is available on the oxygen <b>evolving</b> <b>mechanism</b> in green plants, the actual chemistry remains a mystery. In the elegant kinetic model proposed by Kok and coworkers (see Joliot and Kok [1]), some chemical intermediate is assumed to accumulate up to four oxidizing equivalents in the light before reacting with water to yield oxygen. Since manganese is known to be essential for oxygen evolution and can take on a number of stable oxidation states, it may be acting as the so-called charge accumulating intermediate [2 [...] 5]. However, there has been no evidence for changes in the oxidation state of bound manganese during photosynthesis. In order to resolve the function of manganese, it is necessary to have some means to monitor manganese in its bound state. Nuclear magnetic relax-ation, particularly as applied to water protons, has been used quite Success...|$|E
