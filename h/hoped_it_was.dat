5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} once {{going to}} see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not an unfavorable omen. [...] "No", he replied, [...] "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, AEG stated, {{that based}} on the {{positive}} enthusiasm by fans for waiting in lines for days for tickets to the film, that they had <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a sign that the}} public had not felt that they were exploiting Jackson after his death. AEG president Tim Leiweke stated he hoped that the film would give fans some peace of mind that as a company, Jackson's 'legacy' and well being was always a priority and the fact that people had thought otherwise had really [...] "hurt" [...] people at AEG. Leiweke stated, ...|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of burials conducted by the LNC (around 80%) were pauper funerals on behalf of London parishes, the LNC also reached agreement {{with a number of}} societies, guilds, religious bodies and similar organisations. The LNC provided dedicated sections of the cemetery for these groups, on the basis that those who had lived or worked together in life could remain together after death. Although the LNC was never able to gain the domination of London's funeral industry for which its founders had <b>hoped,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very successful at targeting specialist groups of artisans and trades, {{to the extent that it}} became nicknamed [...] "the Westminster Abbey of the middle classes". A large number of these dedicated plots were established, ranging from Chelsea Pensioners and the Ancient Order of Foresters to the Corps of Commissionaires and the LSWR. The Nonconformist cemetery also includes a Parsee burial ground established in 1862, which [...] remains the only Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe. Dedicated sections in the Anglican cemetery were also reserved for burials from those parishes which had made burial arrangements with the LNC.|$|E

500|$|As the Lotus 72 {{was not as}} {{effective}} as the team <b>hoped,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called [...] "the race of his life". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{government}} {{and the international community}} ultimately declared the February 1980 general election free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become [...] "ZANU–PF"). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting [...] "brutal 'disciplinary murders' as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform", name-taking and [...] "claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted". The Commonwealth Observer Group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly. Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him [...] "most courteously"; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a [...] "wonderful country" [...] with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting {{had a profound effect on}} the former Prime Minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an [...] "apostle of Satan" [...] before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as [...] "sober and responsible". [...] "If this were a true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair," [...] he recalled in his autobiography. [...] "When I got home I said to Janet that I <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not an hallucination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirwan {{shouldered}} {{much of the}} songwriting responsibility {{during this}} troubled and uncertain period for the band, through the changes in both the line-up and in musical style. The pressure showed in his health and he suffered problems with alcoholism; stories abound of Kirwan not eating for several days at a time, subsisting largely on beer. [...] He gradually became estranged from the other band members, and things {{came to a head}} during the autumn of 1972. Before a concert on that year's US tour, Kirwan and Welch rowed over tuning and Kirwan flew into a rage, banging his head and fists against the wall, then smashing his Gibson Les Paul guitar and refused to go onstage. Instead he watched {{while the rest of the}} band struggled through without him, and offered unwelcome criticism afterwards. Kirwan was sacked by Fleetwood, who had hitherto been the only other member still speaking to him. Fleetwood later said: [...] "It was a torment for him, really, to be up there, and it reduced him to someone who you just looked at and thought 'My God'. It was more a thing of, although he was asked to leave, the way I was looking at it was, I <b>hoped,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> almost putting him out of his agony." [...] He later commented, [...] "I don't think he's ever forgiven me really." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reno had a {{reputation}} as a [...] "soldier's soldier" [...] and often was right beside his troops without a sword or any sign of rank. On September 12, 1862, Reno's IX Corps spent the day in Frederick, Maryland, as the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George McClellan advanced westward in pursuit of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under Gen. Robert E. Lee. Elements of Lee's army defended three low-lying [...] "gaps" [...] of South Mountain—Crampton's, Turner's, and Fox's—while concentrating at Sharpsburg, Maryland, to the west, the location of the subsequent Battle of Antietam (September 17, 1862). In the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, Reno stopped directly in front of his troops as he reconnoitered the enemy's forces advancing up the road at Fox's Gap. He was shot in the chest by a rookie Union Soldier from the 35th Massachusetts who mistook him for Rebel Cavalry at dusk. He was brought by stretcher to Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis's command post and said in a clear voice, [...] "Hallo, Sam, I'm dead!" [...] Sturgis, a long-time acquaintance and fellow member of the West Point Class of 1846, thought that he sounded so natural that he must be joking and told Reno that he <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not as bad as all that. Reno repeated, [...] "Yes, yes, I'm dead—good-by!", dying a few minutes later. In his official report, Confederate general D. H. Hill sarcastically remarked, [...] "The Yankees on their side lost General Reno, a renegade Virginian, who was killed by a happy shot from the Twenty-third North Carolina." ...|$|E
