40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the <b>hair</b> <b>wrapping</b> via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery rubber roller to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery roller could stop fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery rubber roller. However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery rubber roller. This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{instruments}} that have strings have an attached keyboards that the player presses keys on {{to trigger a}} mechanism that sounds the strings, instead of directly manipulating the strings. These include the piano, the clavichord, and the harpsichord. With these keyboard instruments too, strings are occasionally plucked or bowed by hand. Modern composers such as Henry Cowell wrote music that requires that the player reach inside the piano and pluck the strings directly, [...] "bow" [...] them with bow <b>hair</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the strings, or play them by rolling the bell of a brass instrument such as a trombone on the array of strings.
