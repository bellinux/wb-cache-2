25|$|Young {{children}} learn {{from experience that}} stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds, before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> <b>In</b> this stage of development, children will sometimes tell outrageous and unbelievable lies, because they lack the conceptual framework to judge whether a statement is believable, or even to {{understand the concept of}} believability.|$|E

Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song's order of placement on the track list of 4, stating that [...] "'Run the World (Girls)' is tagged on like a bonus track following 'I Was Here', which sounds like the perfect ending for the album." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view, saying it [...] "disrupts the flow of up-tempo songs on the second half 4". Perpetua however calls it a [...] "showstopper" [...] and added that it [...] "work well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album".

[...] Another reviewer of the same magazine, Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé's vocals stating that she sings with authority; however, he coined [...] "I Was Here" [...] as a low point on the album and added that it is [...] "swamped in 'My Way'-style self-mythologizing." ...|$|E
