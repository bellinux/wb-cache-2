Researchers at the intersection of social and moral psychology employ diverse methodologies, including surveys, moral dilemmas, economic games, and neuroimaging, to study how individuals think, feel, and act in intergroup moral encounters. We review recent research pertaining to four types of intergroup moral encounters: (a) value-expressive and identity-expressive endorsements of conflict-related actions and policies; (b) helping and harming ingroup and out-group members; (c) <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> transgressions committed by in-group or out-group members; and (<b>d)</b> <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> the suffering of in-group or out-group members. Overall, we explain how sacred values, social motives, group-based moral emotions, and the physiological processes underlying them, shape moral behavior in intergroup conflict...|$|R
40|$|Preparation of {{a series}} of terminally and {{internally}} substituted δ-alkenyl and δ-alkynyl esters 6, 7 and 9, potential precursors to oxazin- 2 -one nitrones, has been attempted. Condensation between pyruvic or benzoylformic acid and the appropriate alcohol proceeded smoothly in some cases whilst allylic transposition was a major feature in other cases – most especially during reactions with α-vinylbenzyl alcohol. Oximation of pyruvic acid derivatives furnished E-oxime isomers whilst benzoylformic acid derivatives afforded mixed geometrical isomers. The E-oxime of 4 a 1 carrying an internal Me group undergoes facile thermal cyclisation affording nitrones 1 c and 1 d in good yield. Oximes E- 5 a,b with a terminal methyl substituent on the alkene moiety furnish nitrone only under the influence of an external electrophile [PhSeBr/AgBF 4]. A terminal Ph substituent on 5 c,d prohibits formation of the cyclic dipole irrespective of reaction conditions, and whilst 5 <b>d</b> <b>reacts</b> <b>to</b> afford a bicyclic isoxazolofuranone 13 by an IOOC reaction (intramolecular oxime olefin cyclisation) 5 c remains thermally inert. Finally δ-alkynyl oximes 9 c,d also failed to cyclise. The regio- and stereochemical characteristics of the cycloadditions between the new dipoles and electron poor olefinic dipolarophiles have been investigated. The conditions needed for reaction were rather forcing since the dipoles are somewhat stabilised by the adjacent alkoxycarbonyl group. All reactions proceeded regiospecifically to give adducts with 5 -substituted isoxazolidine rings whilst diastereoselectivity varied with the choice of dipolarophile and the steric demands of the nitrone substituents. The phenylselenyl dipole 10 a could not be trapped by any dipolarophiles bar dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate...|$|R

It is also {{the first time a}} public health laboratory with its manpower and technical facilities constraint utilized the commercially available leptospira antigens for the rapid macro-slide agglutination test as to pools and as specific serotype antigens. This has helped the clinicians and epidemiologists identify the etiology of the outbreak. At the time of the outbreak in 1976, of 101 sera from patients and residents with complaints within the month, 34 % were positive to one or more leptospira antigen pools; 74 % and 25 % to Pool 3 and to Pool 2 alone or in combination with other pools respectively. Of 517 sera from prisoners without complaints, 1 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> one or more pools, 80 % of these <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> Pool 3 alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Limonene and linalool {{are common}} {{fragrance}} terpenes. Both oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: Oxidized R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and oxidized linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> either oxidized R-limonene or oxidized linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % <b>reacted</b> only <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene and 46 % only to oxidized linalool. Of the 152 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene, 46 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool also <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> {{only one of the}} oxidation mixtures, thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products. This is in accordance with what is generally seen for patch test reactions to fragrance materials...|$|R
