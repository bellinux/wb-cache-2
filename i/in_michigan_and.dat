5|$|In the United States it was {{imported}} {{very early}} in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and piscicide properties. By 1818, it had begun spreading so much that Amos Eaton thought it was a native plant. In 1839 it was already reported <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> in 1876, in California. It is now found commonly in all the states. In Canada, it is most common in the Maritime Provinces as well as southern Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, with scattered populations in between.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotating}} low continued {{along its}} northward path into the evening, bringing its counterclockwise winds in phase with the northwesterly winds already hitting Lakes Superior and Huron. This {{resulted in an}} explosive increase in northerly wind speeds and swirling snow. Ships on Lake Huron that were south of Alpena, Michigan—especially around Harbor Beach and Port Huron <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> Goderich and Sarnia in Ontario—were battered with massive waves moving southward toward St. Clair River.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{instances}} of M-numbered state highways that once existed as extensions of US Highways. M-25 was originally {{an extension of}} US25 before the latter was decommissioned <b>in</b> <b>Michigan,</b> <b>and</b> M-24 was once an extension of US24 before routing changes separated the two highways. M-131 was an extension of US131 until US131 was routed onto the former M-131. There was also once an M-112 that served as an alternate routing for US112 (both have since been changed to I-94 and US12, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

5|$|In 1820–21, {{the federal}} land surveys {{had reached the}} disputed area from two directions, {{progressing}} southward from a baseline <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed {{they were part of}} Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, {{it was agreed that}} the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King over issues of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E
5|$|The Mid-October 2007 tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a widespread}} tornado outbreak {{that took place}} {{across much of the}} eastern half of North America starting on October 18, 2007 and continuing into the early hours of October 19. The outbreak was also responsible for five deaths; three <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> two in Missouri, plus many injuries (including some from non-tornadic events). At least 64 tornadoes were confirmed including 16 on October 17 across six states including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri with wind damage reported in Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, Arkansas and Mississippi. On October 18, at least 48 tornadoes were confirmed across eight states including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, plus widespread straight line wind damage.

5|$|Tornado watches {{were also}} issued for the Lower Great Lakes in the {{afternoon}} hours, and supercells began to track across southern Michigan in the early evening. Two tornadoes touched down <b>in</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York. Two-inch-diameter hail was reported in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. An isolated supercell moved across Central New York {{throughout much of the}} afternoon, producing golf ball-sized hail in Syracuse, and spawned a very brief EF1 tornado in Verona Mills, causing primarily tree damage. Another tornado in Gilbertsville caused significant damage to an athletic field at a school.|$|E
