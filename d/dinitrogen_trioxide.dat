Intracellularly decaying SIN- 1 partly generates nitric oxide as monitored by two independent methods, i. e. the fluorescent nitric oxide scavenger FNOCT- 1 and the nitric oxide electrode. Moreover, reactive nitrogen-oxide species (e. g. peroxynitrite, nitrogen dioxide, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide)</b> were intracellularly formed as detected with the scavenger DAF- 2. Laser scanning microscopy revealed that in L- 929 cells SIN- 1 -derived species initially oxidized the major fraction of the NAD(P) H within the cytosol and the nuclei, whereas the mitochondrial level of NAD(P) H was somewhat increased. This opposite behavior is conclusively explained by the capabilities of SIN- 1 to simultaneously generate reactive nitrogen-oxide species (like peroxynitrite and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide)</b> and freely diffusing nitric oxide in the intracellular milieu. These observations may lead to the conclusion that SIN- 1 penetrated in vivo its target cells in order to stimulate the release of freely diffusing NO.

40|$|Hemoglobin and {{myoglobin}} {{are among}} the most extensively studied proteins, and nitrite {{is one of the most}} studied small molecules. Recently, multiple physiologic studies have surprisingly revealed that nitrite represents a biologic reservoir of NO that can regulate hypoxic vasodilation, cellular respiration, and signaling. These studies suggest a vital role for deoxyhemoglobin- and deoxymyoglobin-dependent nitrite reduction. Biophysical and chemical analysis of the nitrite-deoxyhemoglobin reaction has revealed unexpected chemistries between nitrite and deoxyhemoglobin that may contribute to and facilitate hypoxic NO generation and signaling. The first is that hemoglobin is an allosterically regulated nitrite reductase, such that oxygen binding increases the rate of nitrite conversion to NO, a process termed R-state catalysis. The second chemical property is oxidative denitrosylation, a process by which the NO formed in the deoxyhemoglobin-nitrite reaction that binds to other deoxyhemes can be released due to heme oxidation, releasing free NO. Third, the reaction undergoes a nitrite reductase/anhydrase redox cycle that catalyzes the anaerobic conversion of 2 molecules of nitrite into <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide</b> (N 2 O 3), an uncharged molecule that may be exported from the erythrocyte.

Although this paradoxical fate has generated confusion, separating the biological actions of NO on the basis of its physiologic chemistry provides a conceptual framework which helps to distinguish between the beneficial and toxic consequences of NO, and to envision potential therapeutic strategies for the future. Under normal conditions, NO produced in low concentration acts as a messenger and cytoprotective (antioxidant) factor, via direct interactions with transition metals and other free radicals. Alternatively, when the circumstances allow the formation of substantial amounts of NO and modify the cellular microenvironment (formation of the superoxide radical), the chemistry of NO will turn into indirect effects consecutive to the formation of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide</b> and peroxynitrite.

The apparent first-order rate constant was proportional to the square of the nitrite concentration at pH 4. 4 and it increased as the pH was lowered.

An nfi (endonuclease V) mutant was grown anaerobically with nitrate or nitrite, conditions under which it has a high frequency of A:T-to-G:C transition mutations because of a defect in the repair of hypoxanthine (nitrosatively deaminated adenine) in DNA.

The results suggest that nitrosative mutagenesis occurs during a shift from nitrate/nitrite-dependent respiration under hypoxic conditions to aerobic respiration, when accumulated nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to form endogenous nitrosating agents such as N 2 O 3.

NO and excess glutathione (GSH) was accompanied by the formation of glutathione disulfide, which could not be ascribed to the secondary reaction of GSH with GSNO. Superoxide dismutase significantly increased GSNO yields and the thiyl radical trap, 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), inhibited by 45 and 98 % the formation of GSNO and GSSG, respectively. Maximum nitrosation yields were obtained at an oxygen concentration of 3 %, whereas higher oxygen tensions decreased GSNO and increased GSSG formation. When murine fibroblasts were exposed to exogenous. NO, RSNO formation was sensitive to DMPO and oxygen tension in a manner similar to that observed with GSH alone.

40|$|Ascorbic acid {{has been}} found to promote nitrosothiol {{decomposition}} via two pathways. In the first, ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent for added or adventitious copper (II), producing copper (I). This reacts with the nitrosothiol, giving nitric oxide and disulfide as the ultimate products. The reaction requires only small quantities of ascorbic acid, and is catalytic in copper. The second pathway requires higher concentrations of ascorbic acid, the stoichiometry being one mole of ascorbic acid to two moles of nitrosothiol. The products are nitric oxide and thiol, and the reaction has been interpreted in terms of rate limiting nucleophihc attack by ascorbate at the nitroso nitrogen, followed by decomposition of the 0 -nitroso ascorbate formed to nitric oxide and dehydroascorbic acid. The rate equation is first order in both the nitrosothiol and ascorbic acid, and the entropy of activation is significantly negative. pH - rate profiles reveal the ascorbate dianion is much more reactive than the monoanion, and that the neutral form has negligible reactivity. Nitrosation of thione-containing nitrogen heterocycles by nitrous acid leads to the equilibrium formation of =SNO(^+) species; large equilibrium constants are observed. The reactions exhibit many of the features generally observed in nitrosation, including catalysis by halides and thiocyanate, and some participation by <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide</b> as a nitrosating agent.

Experimental nitroso bond heterolytic dissociation free energies were accurately reproduced {{with a number of}} composite theoretical methods, the most successful being CBS-Q and G 2 MP 2, with average errors of 3. 1 and 3. 4 kJ mol- 1, respectively. Using the MP 2 and B 3 LYP methods, calculations were made with correlation consistent basis sets up to quadruple-ζ, extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. The MP 2 /CBS calculations were accurate to around 10 kJ mol- 1, while the B 3 LYP/ CBS calculations routinely overpredicted experimental bond free energies by ca. 40 kJ mol- 1. It is therefore highly recommended that B 3 LYP energies are not used for nitroso compounds, although other results demonstrate that the B 3 LYP method provides a good account of nitroso compound geometries, frequencies, and entropies. Single-point CBS energy calculations using MP 2 /aug-cc-pVQZ geometries and frequencies showed that the MP 4 (SDTQ) and QCISD(T) methods provide a slight improvement over MP 2 at the CBS limit, although the inclusion of triple excitations is necessary to achieve this improvement in accuracy.

The evidence relating to the structure of the solid and oil products is considered in detail and it is inferred that the latter consisted largely of low molecular weight polymers containing nitro and nitrate groups but complete identification of the components was not possible. From a consideration of the evidence accumulated it is concluded that a free radical mechanism operates during the formation of the afore mentioned compounds. This involves initiation by nitrogen dioxide. The resulting nitro allylic radical can undergo several reactions; combination with nitric oxide to give a nitro-nitroso monomer, which disproportionates nitric oxide into molecular nitrogen and nitrogen trioxide via unconfirmed intermediate; reaction with diene monomer and thus leading to polymerisation; addition of nitrogen dioxide or nitrogen trioxide to give dinitro and nitro-nitrate compounds respectively. Since in many cases the products could not be separated in a pure state, extensive use was made of spectroscopic methods of analysis and the interpretation of these results are explained where relevant...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} covers the {{development}} of assays for bacterial nitrosation and nitrous oxide reductase. The use of these two assays and the nitrite reductase assay allowed a detailed study {{not only of the}} correlation between nitrite reductase and nitrosation but also between nitrous oxide reductase and nitrosation in Neisseria subflava. The three activities have been studied with various electron donors and inhibitors and also with cells grown under various conditions. Maximum activities were:- Nitrite reductase 1130 nmol/min/mg protein with lactate as electron donor, Nitrous oxide reductase 7. 17 ^unol/min/mg protein with glucose as electron donor 7 and nitrosation 427 nmol/min/mg protein with ethanol as electron donor. When this work was coupled with the production of N. subflava mutants deficient in different aspects of denitrification using insertional transposon mutagenesis it provided a wealth of information regarding the correlation between denitrification and bacterial nitrosation. The strains of N. subflava isolated from the achlorhydric stomach were all able to nitrosate. The ability to nitrosate required the reduction of nitrite but nitrite reductase itself was unable to catalyse nitrosation. Reactions involving nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide reductase and dinitrogen were shown to have no involvement in bacterial nitrosation. Leaving only nitric oxide and nitric oxide reductase as possible connections between bacterial nitrosation and denitrification. With the knowledge that oxygen was required for bacterial nitrosation and the growth conditions necessary to induce bacterial nitrosation a hypothesis could be proposed to connect nitrosation activity and denitrification: Nitric oxide may accumulate following nitrite reduction and could be subsequently oxidised (by molecular oxygen) to produce <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide</b> and dinitrogen tetroxide. These two products are known to be very powerful nitrosating agents which can then react with amines, amides and ureas to produce various N-nitroso compounds. As the strains of N. subflava used in this work were gastric isolates it is plausible that these reactions producing N-nitroso compounds could occur in the stomach. This would account for the high risk from gastric cancer seen in patients whose gastric pH is close to 7 allowing bacteria to colonise the stomach...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical models {{which do}} not use any {{experimental}} parameters other than molecular geometry are usually referred to as ab initio methods. One such ab initio molecular orbital method is used in this thesis to study the molecules nitrous acid (HONO), <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>trioxide</b> (N₂O₃) and germane (GeH₄). An ab initio valence bond study was done on dihydrogen sulfide (SH₂). All used a slater-type minimal basis set. Except for germane, integrals were calculated by using closed formulae, but some repulsion integrals were calculated numerically with a gaussian expansion technique. The integral program was enlarged to accommodate orbital types 3 s through to 4 p. Heavy, perhaps even excessive, reliance has been put in Mulliken's population analysis for interpreting the molecular orbital wavefunctions. This method has been criticized often and can be misleading, but it does offer a simple conceptual way of interpreting wavefunctions. Used in a comparative manner most of its difficulties are reduced. Chapter one outlines briefly the theory necessary for {{an understanding of the}} methods used, implementations of these methods, interpreting techniques and the extensions to the integral program. A discussion and comparison on length of gaussian expansion and extent of its use (the nG/S and STO-nG methods) in integral evaluation is given. Chapter Two discusses and reviews the bonding and structure of nitrous acid, [diagram here] HONO has two stable planar forms which are almost equal energetically. A high barrier separates them. The geometry of the cis form has longer N=O and O-H bonds, but a shorter N-O bond with respect to the trans. These features and the barrier have been discussed in the literature in terms of some weak hydrogen bonding in the cis and a partial N-O π bond or by the various lone pair interactions. Calculations at three HONO geometries were done; the experimental cis and trans geometries and a gauche form to represent the barrier top. The results were interpreted within the framework of perturbation theory with the unperturbed wavefunction being that, of trans. This represents a picture of the geometry differences between cis and trans as being due to the mixing in, under the increased N=O oxygen-hydrogen interaction, of the unoccupied 0 -H* orbital by the HOMO to give a weaker O-H bond but a stronger N-O σ bond in cis. This stronger N-O σ skeleton allows greater π interaction (oxygen lone pair electrons delocalizing into the N=O n* orbital). The breaking of this partial N-O π bond is a major component of the barrier between the planar isomers. To date four other ab initio calculations have been made on HONO. Chapter Three presents the results of a calculation on N₂O₃ at its experimental geometry. For reference purposes calculations were done on NO and NO₂ using the N₂O₃ parameters. In reviewing N₂O₃; [diagram here] the molecules [diagram here] been included, as these three form a set with the common features of a very long N-N bond (and small ∆Hdiss) and yet are planar. The NO and NO₂ geometries in this set are very similar to those for free NO and NO₂. The bonding in the three molecules is thus intermediate between normal and Van der Waals bonding, and is in a similar position to hydrogen bonding. To the author's knowledge no other calculation has been published on N₂O₃. There are several ab initio calculations on N₂O₄ and N₂O₂. N₂O₄ {{has a long history of}} empirical attempts to explain its long N-N bond and planarity, such as: (i) a 'π-only' bond with no σ bond; (ii) a charge transfer configuration; and (iii) a weakening of the σ bond by delocalization of oxygen's lone pair electrons into the σ antibonding orbital. A similar case is stabilization of the odd electrons in NO₂ which is not available in N₂O₄. The barrier is explained by most as being due to a weak N-N π bond, but a few use a weak cis O … O bond. The two latest ab initio calculations' models are for either a delocalization of the oxygen lone pairs into the N-N σ* with the barrier due to the cis O … O bond making this interaction more favourable in the planar form, or for repulsion due to the occupied molecular orbitals of NO₂ with a stabilization from only the HOMO. This HOMO is a linear combination of NO₂'s HOMO which is delocalized over NO₂ and so gives a smaller N-N bond order. The barrier is then due to the balance of less repulsion in the skew form with greater cis O [...] . O bonding in the planar geometry. The results for N₂O₃ showed that it needs a multi-configurational wavefunction to describe it energetically. The localized molecular orbitals of N₂O₃ gave orbitals that are similar to the classical concepts of bonds, lone pairs and inner shells. They resemble those of the free NO and NO₂ for the two cis N-O bonds and that of NO₂- for the third N-O bond. There is a nitrogen bond but it is cancelled by the antibonding tails from the nitrogen and cis oxygen lone pairs. The N₂O₃ HOMO contains the net N-N bonding and is a linear combination of the NO and NO 2 HOMO’s. There is also a weak cis O … O bond. Simple models for N₂O₃ bonding were explored and the rotation barrier studied by the semiempirical extended Hückel theory. Reasons for the long N-N bond were advanced. i. e. A 'normal' N-N bonded N₂O₃ is intrinsically unstable with respect to NO and NO₂ due to the loss of 'three electron bonding' in NO and NO₂. Perturbation theory shows that there is a stabilization from the interaction of the NO and NO₂ HOMO's as they are singly occupied. This can overcome the basic instability at the longer bond lengths. The interaction is weakened by the fact that the HOMO's are delocalized over NO and NO₂ and that the repulsions from the doubly occupied molecular orbitals will increase faster than the stabilization at shorter bond lengths. Planarity needed both the O … O bonding and the N-O 'three electron bonding'. Chapter four deals with the valence bond calculations on SH₂ done at three angles but with the same S-H distance. This is a continuation of similar calculations on H₂O, CH₂, BH₃ and BeH₂. Several molecular orbital calculations and one other valence bond calculation have been done. However some different aspects were looked at in this work. A frozen 'core' approximation was used resulting in only six electrons being considered directly (eight for the hybrid orbital configurations). Convergence was slow with respect to numbers of configurations after the first three to five. Use of hybrid orbital configurations is 2. 5 times better in terms of number of determinants needed to reach a certain energy. Relative importance of configurations was explored but was found to be an imprecise concept which was dependent on the number and type of configurations present. In comparison with H₂O, CH₂, BH₃, and BeH₂, SH₂ converged more slowly to the molecular orbital energy. This was due to its larger core of 12 electrons compared with 6 valence electrons, as opposed to 10 and 6 for, say, H₂O. It was, however, the only one for which the calculated value of the angle θ between the bonding hybrids was close to the experimental. These five molecules all exhibited 'non-perfect following' of θ, i. e. as the bond angle was changed, the optimum value of θ for the lowest energy remained constant...|$|E
