5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types <b>IgG</b> and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both <b>IgG</b> and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. <b>IgG,</b> by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, <b>IgG</b> reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both <b>IgG</b> and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for <b>IgG</b> and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of <b>IgG</b> alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific <b>IgG</b> is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called <b>IgG,</b> is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas <b>IgG</b> indicates an infection sometime in the past. <b>IgG</b> antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) and its pre-cancerous stage {{monoclonal}} gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) {{allow to}} study immune responses and the chronology of inflammation {{in the context}} of blood malignancies. Both diseases are characterized by the production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (mc Ig) which for subsets of MGUS and MM patients targets pathogens known to cause latent infection, a major cause of inflammation. Inflammation may influence the structure of both polyclonal (pc) Ig and mc Ig produced by malignant plasma cells via the sialylation of Ig Fc fragment. Here, we characterized the sialylation of purified mc and pc <b>IgGs</b> from 148 MGUS and MM patients, in comparison to pc <b>IgGs</b> from 46 healthy volunteers. The inflammatory state of patients was assessed by the quantification in serum of 40 inflammation-linked cytokines, using Luminex technology. While pc <b>IgGs</b> from MGUS and MM patients showed heterogeneity in sialylation level, mc <b>IgGs</b> from both MGUS and MM patients exhibited a very low level of sialylation. Furthermore, mc <b>IgGs</b> from MM patients were less sialylated than mc <b>IgGs</b> from MGUS patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 01), and mc <b>IgGs</b> found to target an infectious pathogen showed a lower level of sialylation than mc <b>IgGs</b> of undetermined specificity (p[*]=[*] 0. 048). Regarding inflammation, 14 cytokines were similarly elevated with a p value[*]<[*] 0. 0001 in MGUS and in MM compared to healthy controls. MM differed from MGUS by higher levels of HGF, IL- 11, RANTES and SDF- 1 -α (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). MGUS and MM patients presenting with hyposialylated pc <b>IgGs</b> had significantly higher levels of HGF, IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, TGF-β 1, IL- 17, and IL- 33 compared to patients with hyper-sialylated pc <b>IgGs</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). In MGUS and in MM, the degree of sialylation of mc and pc <b>IgGs</b> and the levels of four cytokines important for the anti-microbial response were correlated, either positively (IFN-α 2, IL- 13) or negatively (IL- 17, IL- 33). Thus in MGUS as in MM, hyposialylation of mc <b>IgGs</b> is concomitant with increased levels of cytokines that {{play a major role in}} inflammation and anti-microbial response, which implies that infection, inflammation, and abnormal immune response contribute to the pathogenesis of MGUS and MM...|$|R
40|$|Maternal-fetal <b>IgGs</b> {{transport}} occurs either prenatally or postnatally, which confers the newborns with {{passive immunity}} before their own immune system has matured. However, {{little is known}} about the mechanisms of postnatal <b>IgGs</b> passage in the mammary gland. To investigate how FcRn mediates the <b>IgGs</b> transport in the mammary gland, we first generated bFcRn and anti-HAV mAb transgenic mice, and then obtained HF transgenic mice expressing both transgenes by mating the above two strains. Transgene expression of bFcRn in the four lines was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. We then localized the expression of bFcRn to the acinar epithelial cells in the mammary gland, and anti-HAV mAb was mainly detected in the acini with weak staining in the acinar epithelial cells. Human <b>IgGs</b> could be detected in both milk and serum of HF transgenic mice by western blot and ELISA. A significantly lower milk to serum ratio of human <b>IgGs</b> in HF mice compared with that of anti-HAV mAb mice, indicating that bFcRn could transport human <b>IgGs</b> across the milk-blood barrier from milk to serum during lactation in HF mice.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that human natural autoantibodies enriched in antiestrogen receptor Ig (<b>IgGs)</b> display estrogenic activity in MCF- 7 mammary carcinoma cells. In this study, we investigated IgGs' mechanism of action. We showed that: 1) <b>IgGs</b> Fab fragments (which contain only one antigen binding site) induced an estrogenic response in MCF- 7 cells, producing estrogen receptor (ER) down-regulation {{and an increase}} in progesterone receptor concentration; 2) <b>IgGs</b> specifically inhibited MCF- 7 cell surface labeling with fluorescent estradiol (E 2) -BSA conjugates; 3) this inhibition of E 2 - BSA binding to membrane estrogen binding sites was largely caused by natural anti-E 2 -BSA antibodies (Ab) selectively associated with the natural anti-ER Ab within IgGs; 4) furthermore, these natural anti-E 2 -BSA Ab accounted for most of <b>IgGs</b> estrogenic activity in cell culture; 5) however, when incubated with cytosolic ER, they did not behave like estrogens, but they decreased ER hormone binding capacity; and 6) although <b>IgGs</b> stimulated cAMP production, their anti-E 2 -BSA Ab subpopulation did not. In conclusion, the estrogenic activity of <b>IgGs</b> does not involve Ab mimicking E 2 molecular configuration or ligand-independent cAMP mediated pathways, membrane Fc receptors, and membrane receptor cross-linking mechanisms. On the contrary, <b>IgGs</b> seem to function by neutralizing estrogen-like epitopes, associated with ER-related peptides, which might inhibit ER activation.

We purified and fraction-ated insulin-binding <b>IgGs</b> from cat sera by affinity chromatography and analyzed affinity of insulin-binding <b>IgGs</b> for insulin and their epitopes. Following the passing of fraction A, which did not bind to insulin, insulin-binding <b>IgGs</b> were eluted into two fractions, B and C, by affinity chromatography using a column fixed with bovine insulin. Dissociation constant (KD) values between insulin-binding <b>IgGs</b> and insulin, deter-mined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Biacore™system), were 1. 64 e− 4 M for fraction B (low affinity <b>IgGs)</b> and 2 e− 5 M for fraction C (high affinity <b>IgGs).</b> Epitope analysis was conducted using 16 peptide fragments synthesized in concord with the amino acid sequence of feline insulin by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fractions B and C showed higher absorbance (affinity) of the peptide fragment of 10 amino acid residues at the carboxyl-terminal of the B chain (peptide No. 19), followed by peptide fragments of 6 to 15 amino acid residues of the B chain (peptide No. 8).

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{extend the}} study of the camel milk {{proteins}} which have antiviral activity against HCV, camel naïve polyclonal <b>IgGs,</b> α-lactalbumin were purified from camel milk and their anti-HCV effect was examined using PBMCs and Huh 7. 5 cell-lines. They were compared with the activity of human polyclonal <b>IgGs</b> and camel lactoferrin and casein. Material and methods Three types of experiments were performed on PBMCs and HuH 7. 5 cell. HCV was directly incubated with the purified proteins and then mixed with both cell types, or the proteins were incubated with the cells and then exposed to HCV, or the HCV pre-infected cells were treated with the proteins to inhibit intracellular replication. The proteins were added to cells or virus at different concentrations and time intervals. Results Pretreated PBMCs and Huh 7. 5 cells with milk proteins were not protected when exposed to HCV infection. The direct interaction between HCV and camel <b>IgGs</b> and camel lactoferrin (cLf) led to a complete inhibition of HCV entry into cells, while casein, α-lactalbumin and human <b>IgGs</b> failed to inhibit HCV entry at any tested concentration. Camel <b>IgGs</b> showed ability to recognize HCV peptides with a significant titer (12 [*]×[*] 10 3) in comparison with human <b>IgGs</b> which failed to do it.

LEMS <b>IgGs</b> reduced by 30 – 36 % the whole-cell Ba 2 + currents through Q-like Ca 2 + channels at + 10 mV without significantly modifying their voltage dependence and activation kinetics. Single- and multiple-channel recordings in cell-attached and outside-out patches of cells treated with LEMS <b>IgGs</b> showed no significant changes of the channel elementary properties but rather a decreased number of active channels per patch. This suggests that Q-like current depression by LEMS autoantibodies is mostly due to a down-regulation of functioning Ca 2 + channels. In agreement with previous observations, LEMS <b>IgGs</b> also reduced by 20 – 33 % the dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) Bat+ current. The suggested down-regulation of Q-like channels by LEMS <b>IgGs</b> in RINm 5 F cells may have a functional correlation with the depressive action of LEMS autoantibodies on the PIQ-type Ca 2 + channels controlling acetylcholine release from mammalian neuromuscular junctions...|$|R

After in vitro infection with R 5 -tropic strains, we obtained similar percentages of infected cells for both dendritic cell (DC) subsets. Moreover, LC infection was not increased by blockage of langerin by antilangerin.
