50|$|Cultural {{heritage}} management (CHM) is the vocation {{and practice}} of managing cultural heritage. It is a branch of cultural resources management (CRM), although it also draws on the practices of cultural conservation, restoration, museology, archaeology, history and architecture. While the term cultural heritage is generally used in Europe, in the USA the term cultural resources is in more general use specifically referring to cultural heritage resources. CHM has traditionally been concerned with the identification, interpretation, maintenance, and preservation of significant cultural sites and physical heritage assets, although intangible aspects of heritage, such as traditional skills, cultures and languages are also considered. The subject typically receives most attention, and resources, {{in the face of}} threat, where the focus is often upon rescue or salvage archaeology. Possible threats include urban development, large-scale agriculture, mining activity, looting, erosion or unsustainable visitor numbers. The public face of CHM, and a significant source of income to support continued management of heritage, is the interpretation and presentation to the public, where it is an important aspect of tourism. Communicating with government and the public is therefore a <b>key</b> <b>competence.</b>|$|E
50|$|A wide view on {{approaches}} and practices on self-assessment of competence in Adult education {{is offered by}} a European project VINTAGE - online tool for self eValuatIoN of key competences in adulT AGE that reports a desk study focused on the acquisition and self-assessment of key competences in adult education in Italy, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Sweden. The VINTAGE self-assessment framework has been tested during seven parallel focus group sessions, in the six partner Countries, involving roughly hundred experts and practitioners at European level. The self-assessment procedure offers an innovative alternative to common knowledge based multiple-choice questionnaires to evaluate competences. It assigns an active role to the user, calling upon reflective abilities, self-assessment competences and self-responsibility. The procedure focuses on the Lifelong Learning approach, aiming to offer a tool for personal empowerment and development, rather than for solely selective or professional purposes.Vintage assessment framework focuses on actual behavior a person is demonstrating in a realistic context, or rather a reconstruction of a realistic context in a particular situation, evaluating the mastery level {{and the quality of}} the performance. This chosen approach towards the assessment of learning outcomes and competences is as well supported by research that highlights the importance of the performance side in demonstrating (<b>key)</b> <b>competence</b> within the field of education and lifelong learning. It is a process that requires involvement and participation by the user and reflection, bringing into play meta-competences typical of the self-assessment process and therefore particularly suited to an adult context. Engaging the user in such an active and responsible way additionally improves the self-assessment competences and aims at raising motivation of the adult learner and supporting the idea of self-directness of lifelong learning.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recent study}} aimed {{to fill in}} that gap, and offer a more precise {{language}} for discussing the term. While examining sisu within the psychological framework, it sought to render it less elusive as a construct by giving it an easily citable definition rooted {{within the field of}} positive psychology. Sisu as a psychological power potential was introduced {{for the first time in}} the 3rd World Congress on Positive Psychology in Los Angeles on 29 June 2013. [...] In the study, sisu is described as a psychological <b>key</b> <b>competence</b> which enables extraordinary action to overcome a mentally or physically challenging situation. Sisu also contributes to what has been named the action mindset; a consistent, courageous approach toward challenges which at first seem to exceed our capacities. A related on-line survey (conducted between March and May 2013) tracked the cultural representations of sisu among contemporary Finns (and Finnish Americans) and revealed that sisu is still deeply valued, and that there is public interest for cultivating this strength capacity as well. All in all, the study received 1,060 responses. Among the main findings was the perception of sisu as a reserve of power, which enables extraordinary action to overcome mentally or physically challenging situations (rather than being the ability to pursue long-term goals and be persistent). To elaborate on the function of sisu: it is a powerful psychological potential which enables the individual to tap into mental strength beyond their pre-conceived resources. Wielding sisu in the face of adversity helps individuals push through what first seemed like the boundaries of their mental or physical capacities. Furthermore, sisu is an action mindset which equips the individual to choose to take on challenges beyond their observed capacities. It provides the final empowering push when we would otherwise hesitate to act. Sisu can be conceptualized as taking action against the odds. Additionally, even though 53% of the respondents believed some people innately have more sisu, a majority of 83% of the respondents believed that sisu is a flexible quality which can be cultivated through conscious practice (rather than a being a fixed quality), and the majority of respondents were interested in developing this capacity.|$|E
