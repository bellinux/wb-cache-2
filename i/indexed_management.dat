40|$|The {{most recent}} {{epistemological}} evolution of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) is analyzed to extend previous state-of-the-art research by de Bakker et al. (2005 and 2006) both in management and marketing literatures. A three judges based Content Analysis of 570 papers published from 2003 to 2006 in <b>indexed</b> <b>management</b> and marketing journals shows that, for this period, the epistemological evolution of CSR is framed within a Progressive view in both disciplines. Findings help to discard that CSR evolution exhibits a Variegational stance, and to confirm that, {{as in the previous}} 30 years (1972 - 2002), CSR epistemological evolution from 2003 - 2006 does not strongly express high priority to a Normativist view.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether management- and marketing-salient literature focused on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and related issues has evolved from 2003 to 2006, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and to learn which of three competitive epistemological evolutional views (progressive, variegational, normativist) best fits CSR evolution in both disciplines. Design/methodology/approach – Following an ex professo methodology developed by de Bakker, Groenewegen and Den Hond, a content analysis (CA) -based empirical examination of 570 papers focused on CSR and corporate social performance (CSP) published in <b>indexed</b> <b>management</b> and marketing journals between 2003 and 2006 was conducted. The selected temporal scope is equivalent, in terms of CSR published papers, to the period 1972 - 2002 analyzed by de Bakker et al. Three coders judged each paper by their epistemological orientation and discipline pertinence, achieving larger enough reliability coefficients. Findings – The epistemological evolution of CSR within the management and marketing literatures fits a progressive view, and both alternative evolutional perspectives, variegational and normativist, were rejected. This finding means that theoretical-oriented papers (conceptual, exploratory or predictive) prevailed over prescriptive (instrumental and normative) and descriptive articles. This qualitative evolution has been accompanied by a significant growth in the total number of CSR papers published in the broad management field from 2003 to 2006. Research limitations/implications – Judgments were mainly based on papers' abstracts, titles and keywords. Full text analyses were only done on those cases where coders had doubts. Originality/value – The research contributes to a better understanding of the role of CSR within the management and marketing disciplines, as it is the first to analyse the epistemological evolution of CSR in the academic research. The findings serve to refute the ideas that CSR research has an intrinsic normative character, is still too embryonic or has a disoriented evolution. Company performance, Social responsibility...|$|E
40|$|Recent work on {{client-server}} data-shipping OODBs {{has demonstrated}} {{the usefulness of}} local data caching at client sites. In addition to data caching, index caching can provide substantial benefits through associative access to cached objects. Indexes usually have high contention, and database performance is quite sensitive to the <b>index</b> <b>management</b> scheme. This paper examinesthe effects of two index caching schemes, one centralized and the other distributed, for <b>index</b> page <b>management</b> in a page server OODB. In the centralized scheme, index pages {{are not allowed to}} be cached at client sites and are managed by the server.

40|$|Data centric {{storage is}} an {{effective}} algorithm to organize data in the sensor networks. Even though such kind of storage can save more energy than other algorithms, such as flooding based algorithm, it also wastes energy in some cases. For example, the event frequency {{is much more than}} the query frequency. To overcome this problem, we propose an index based query processing algorithm. We analyze the energy consumption of the algorithm and present conditions for the index based algorithm to save more energy than the traditional data centric storage. Finally a time-based <b>index</b> <b>management</b> algorithm is proposed to adopt the proper algorithm in different cases.

40|$|Both {{in terms}} of number of {{participating}} users and in traffic volume, KaZaA {{is one of the}} most important applications in the Internet today. Nevertheless, because KaZaA is proprietary and uses encryption, little is understood about KaZaA’s overlay structure and dynamics, its messaging protocol, and its <b>index</b> <b>management.</b> We have built two measurement apparatus- the KaZaA Sniffing Platform and the KaZaA Probing Tool- to unravel many of the mysteries behind KaZaA. We deploy the apparatus to study KaZaA’s overlay structure and dynamics, its neighbor selection, its use of dynamic port numbers to circumvent firewalls, and its <b>index</b> <b>management.</b> Although this study does not fully solve the KaZaA puzzle, it nevertheless leads to a coherent description of KaZaA and its overlay. Furthermore, we leverage the measurement results to set forth a number of key principles for the design of a successful unstructured P 2 P overlay. The measurement results and resulting design principles in this paper should be useful for future architects of P 2 P overlay networks as well as for engineers managing ISPs. 1...|$|R

Change of workload characteristics, indexes selected by the query optimizer’s “magic”, subtle differences in the expressiveness of indexes, and tailor-made index properties ask—in addition to (long-range) manual index selection—for rapid autonomic reactions and self-tuning options by the DBMS. Hence, when managing an existing set of indexes (i. e., a configuration), its cost trade-off has to be steadily controlled by observing query runtimes, index creation and maintenance, and space constraints.

40|$|The {{topic for}} this thesis is <b>index</b> <b>{{management}}</b> in Database management Systems (DBMS). The thesis is {{split in two}} related parts. The first part documents the design and implementation of Rindex, a platform whose goal is to support research on <b>index</b> <b>management</b> in RAM. This work (both the programing and the writing) was done in collaboration with Tomas Are Haavet. The idea behind the project is to keep all indexes but the primary ones entirely in main memory, and to create indexes on all attributes whose value domain is strictly ordered. Another fundamental concept is that instead of applying the query operators to relations, we apply them to indexes. In it's current implementation, Rindex is only concerned with queries, and only {{a subset of the}} query language from SQL is implemented. The second part first establishes a methodology for evaluating Rindex, and then uses this methodology for an actual evaluation. Here Rindex is evaluated by doing a comparative analysis against Oracle. The analysis is done by measuring the execution time of the two platforms for a set of selected queries. The queries are partitioned into five test cases, that delves into the basic operations: joins, selections and projections, but also index generation. The platform is far too immature, so an absolute conclusion can not be done. However the tests all indicate that there might be significant performance gains by managing indexes the ``Rindex way''...|$|R
40|$|Recent work on {{client-server}} data-shipping OODBs {{has demonstrated}} {{the usefulness of}} local data caching at client sites. However, none of the studies has investigated index-related performance issues in particular. References to index pages arise from associative queries and from updates on indexed attributes, often making indexes the most heavily used hot spots in a database. System performance is therefore quite sensitive to the <b>index</b> <b>management</b> scheme. This paper examines the e ects of index caching, and investigates two schemes, one centralized and the other distributed, for <b>index</b> page <b>management</b> inapage server OODB. In the centralized scheme, index pages {{are not allowed to}} be cached at client sites � thus, communication with the central server is required for all index-based queries and index updates.

In this paper, we positively answer this question by presenting a rewriting framework where mesh refinements are described by simple rules. This framework is based on a notion of topological chain rewriting. Topological chains generalize the notion of labeled graph to higher dimensional objects. This framework has been implemented in the domain specific language MGS.
