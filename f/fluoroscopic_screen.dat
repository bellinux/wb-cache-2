2500|$|But {{the quest}} for {{recorded}} moving images was a more complex challenge. In the 1890s, moving pictures of any kind (whether taken with visible light or with invisible radiation) were emerging technologies. Because the word photography (literally [...] "recording/engraving with light") was long since established as connoting a still-image medium, the word cinematography (literally [...] "recording/engraving movement") was coined for the new medium of visible-light moving pictures. Soon several new words were coined for achieving moving radiographic pictures. This was often done either by filming a simple <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screen</b> with a movie camera (variously called fluorography, cinefluorography, photofluorography, or fluororadiography) or by taking serial radiographs rapidly {{to serve as the}} frames in a movie (cineradiography). Either way, the resulting film reel could be displayed by a movie projector. Another group of techniques were various kinds of kymography, whose common theme was capturing recordings in a series of moments, with a concept similar to movie film although not necessarily with movie-type playback; rather, the sequential images would be compared frame by frame (a distinction comparable to tile mode versus cine mode in today's CT terminology). Thus electrokymography and roentgenkymography were among the early ways to record images from a simple <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pupin {{completed}} his studies in 1883 {{as one of}} the best students, especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883-1885), where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on 2 January 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screen</b> which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was [...] "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour" [...] which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if [...] "drawn with pen and ink." [...] Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.|$|E

40|$|Several electrokymographs were {{subjected}} to study of their recording fidelity. Distortions were found in respect to time and amplitude of recorded response. The recording defects were analyzed quantitatively, {{and the degree to}} which the various components of the electrokymograph contribute to these distortions was measured. The significance of these deviations in recording fidelity is discussed in reference to the application of the electrokymlograph to the study of cardiovascular dynamics. T HE ELECTROKYMOGIRAPH was de-vised to record the border motions of the heart and great vessels. '- ' Although simple in operation, the instrument is complex in principle. In ordinary fluoroscopy, an x-ray beam, pulsating at 120 cycles per second, passes differentially through the thoracic tissues and causes characteristic shadows and translucen-cies to appear on a fluoroscopic viewscreen. The process of electrokymography interposes another small rectangle of <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screen</b> placed perpendicularly to the moving border of the desired objective. The changes in inten-sity of illumination of this screen are converted by a photomultiplier tube to changes in milli-volt output from the tube. These millivolt changes are recorded by an electrocardiograph after passage through an electrical filter. The filter is a complex system of condensers and resistors, designed to eliminate the 120 cycle per second pulsations of the x-ray beam with-out interfering with the lower frequency changes in <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screen</b> illumination. As with any apparatus, knowledge of the recording fidelity is essential.

40|$|Introduction The {{gastro-oesophageal}} junction is very {{mobile and}} constantly changing position with breathing, swallowing and transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR). The only method currently available for studying its location is <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> {{and this is}} limited by radiation exposure. We have developed a method allowing continuous real-time monitoring of the squamo-columnar (SC) junction without radiation exposure. It involves clipping a small magnet endoscopically to the SC junction and monitoring its location {{by a series of}} 26 Hall Effect sensors placed at 5 mm interval within a probe placed in oesophageal lumen. The aim {{of the study was to}} validate the new technique against fluoroscopy. Methods In eight subjects, the magnet was attached and locator probe inserted. During simultaneous fluoroscopy, subjects were asked to perform normal breathing, deep breathing, water swallows and finally advancement and retraction of locator probe over 12 cm segment. The fluoroscopy recorded images at a rate of 5 frames per seconds and the locator at 8 Hz. The position recorded by fluoroscopy and locator at each second interval were compared as well as amplitude of each complete manoeuvre. Results The correlation co-efficient for all 224 position readings was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 89 to 0. 96) and adjusted residual squared (R 2) of 0. 91. The amplitude for the different manoeuvres was similar by the two techniques.

30|$|In summary, {{uncomplicated}} EVAR {{procedures have}} lower <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> times and deliver acceptable doses of radiation to patients, supporting their use over open aneurysm repair in appropriate patients. The radiation burden significantly increases {{in patients who}} require pre-EVAR iliac artery embolisation and when routine surveillance CT examinations are taken into consideration. Undertaking EVAR in younger patients should be viewed with caution as these patients have a greater lifetime risk of developing a radiation-induced cancer. Furthermore, as repetitive CT examinations {{have been shown to}} cumulatively deliver high doses of radiation to patients, this highlights the importance of following-up patients with non-ionising radiation techniques whenever possible. More complicated EVAR procedures in patients with less favorable aortic anatomy must be planned with caution, as they will deliver larger doses of radiation. Furthermore, these procedures are often associated with additional re-intervention and require more frequent follow-up CT examinations, ultimately increasing a patient’s potential radiation-induced cancer risk. The {{results of the present study}} highlight the issues of radiation dose associated with EVAR procedures and related interventions, thereby allowing clinicians to provide patients with the appropriate information and counseling regarding potential levels of exposure. In addition, these findings will help clinicians to provide better informed consent, especially for those patients requiring more complicated EVAR procedures.|$|R

Several measures have been developed to quantify radiation exposure during a procedure and cardiologists usually refer to <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> time (FST). FST, however, has limitations for predicting deterministic injury which is directly dependant on peak skin dose (PSD). We compared FST to PSD for a range of interventional cardiac electrophysiology procedures. Methods: All patients undergoing electrophysiology procedures during a 2 -month period in our institution were studied. Demographic details, nature of procedure, FST and PSD were measured. The FST to PSD ratio was calculated and compared between patient and procedural factors. Results: 67 procedures on patients (23 female) with body mass index (BMI) of 28 (SD 5) Kg/m 2 were studied. Screening times ranged from 0. 2 to 96. 6 min (median 11. 2). PSD ranged from < 0. 1 to 1108 mGy (median 141). There was a positive correlation between PSD to FST ratio and BMI (r= 0. 59, p < 0. 001). The PSD to FST ratio was higher in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices than single or dual chamber ICDs (p= 0. 002).

However, medial deltoid ligament ruptures are difficult to diagnose using current imaging modalities. We hypothesized that ultrasonography {{can be used to}} accurately allow early clinical assessment of ankle fracture stability, thereby negating the need to perform plain film stress views of the acutely injured ankle. This prospective study included 12 patients (age range, 18 - 72) with supination external rotation fractures requiring operative fixation. Following induction of anesthesia, ultrasonography examination was performed, followed by an arthrogram under <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening.</b> Radiographs, ultrasonography, and arthrographic findings were compared. There was 100 % correlation between ultrasonography and arthrogram findings. Ultrasonography accurately diagnosed medial deltoid rupture with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 100 %. Plain film radiographs of the ankle had a sensitivity of 57. 1 % and a specificity of 60 %. The difference between these was significant (χ(2) =. 0091). This study demonstrates diagnostic ultrasonography to be an accurate diagnostic modality in assessing medial deltoid ligament integrity in patients with supination external rotation fractures. It offers the same sensitivity and specificity as arthrography without the need for additional invasive procedures. Its relative ease of use and lack of ionizing radiation make it a potentially useful tool, particularly in a busy trauma service...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A precise {{puncture}} of the renal {{collecting system}} is the most essential step for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). There are many techniques describing this crucial first step in PCNL including the bull's eye technique, triangulation technique, free-hand technique, and gradual descensus technique. We describe a novel puncture guide to assist accurate percutaneous needle placement during bull's eye technique. Methods: The mini access guide (MAG) stabilizes the initial puncture needle by mounting it on an adjustable multidirectional carrier fixed to the patient's skin, which aids in achieving the “bull's eye” puncture. It also avoids a direct fluoroscopic exposure of the urologist's hand during the puncture. Sixty consecutive patients with solitary renal calculus were randomized to traditional hand versus MAG puncture during bull's eye technique of puncture and the fluoroscopy time was assessed. Results: The median fluoroscopy screening time for traditional free-hand bull's eye and MAG-guided bull's eye puncture (<b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> time for puncture) was 55 versus 21 s (P = 0. 001) and the median time to puncture was 80 versus 55 s (P = 0. 052), respectively. Novice residents also learned puncture technique faster with MAG on simulator. Conclusion: The MAG is a simple, portable, cheap, and novel assistant to achieve successful PCNL puncture. It would be of great help for novices to establish access during their learning phase of PCNL. It would also be an asset toward significantly decreasing the radiation dose during PCNL access...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 36 th Annual Meeting of the Pacific Association of Pediatric Surgeons, Sydney, Australia, 12 - 16 May 2003. Purpose: Whereas {{endoscopic}} balloon dilatation (EBD) of benign esophageal strictures is {{an established}} mode of therapy in adults, {{this has not}} been accepted universally in the pediatric population. The aim {{of this study is to}} report the safety, efficacy, and long-term results of EBD for children in the authors' center. Methods: Between 1986 and 2002, a total of 77 children (median age, 1. 8 years; range, 2 months to 20 years) were treated by EBD for various causes: 2 had achalasia, and 75 had esophageal strictures (postesophageal atresia repair, 63; reflux esophagitis, 7; postfundoplication, 2; caustic injury, 3). Dilatations were performed using flexible endoscopy and <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> under general anesthesia. Results: A total of 260 dilatations were carried out with the mean number of EBD per patient being 3. 4 (range, 1 to 19). A mean period of 5 months (maximum, 28 months) for each patient was required. Four complications of esophageal perforations (1. 5 %) were observed, but only one required surgical repair because of persistent leakage. The remaining patients have undergone long-term follow-up (median follow-up, 6. 6 years), and all are asymptomatic. Conclusions: This large series has shown that EBD can provide a safe and effective mean of relieving esophageal strictures with good long-term results. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Purposes. To present {{our series}} of 38 prone {{percutaneous}} nephrolithotomy procedures performed with renal access and tract dilation purely under ultrasound guidance and describe the benefits and challenges accompanying this approach. Methods. Thirty-eight consecutive patients presenting for percutaneous nephrolithotomy for renal stone removal were included in this prospective cohort study. Ultrasonographic imaging in the prone position was used to obtain percutaneous renal access and guide tract dilation. <b>Fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> was used only for nephrostomy tube placement. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative procedural and patient data were collected for analysis. Results. Mean age of patients was 52. 7 ± 17. 2 years. Forty-five percent of patients were male with mean BMI of 26. 1 ± 7. 3 and mean stone size of 27. 2 ± 17. 6 millimeters. Renal puncture was performed successfully with ultrasonographic guidance in all cases with mean puncture time of 135. 4 ± 132. 5 seconds. Mean dilation time was 11. 5 ± 3. 8 [*]min and mean stone fragmentation time was 37. 5 ± 29. 0 [*]min. Mean total operative time was 129. 3 ± 41. 1. No patients experienced any significant immediate postoperative complication. All patients were rendered stone-free and no additional secondary procedures were required. Conclusions. Ultrasound guidance for renal access and tract dilation in prone percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a feasible and effective technique. It can be performed safely with significantly reduced fluoroscopic radiation exposure to the patient, surgeon, and intraoperative personnel...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Fluoroscopic {{guidance}} is {{a routine}} practice in endourology; both the physician and the assistances {{are exposed to}} some radiation via radiation scatter. Measurement of radiation doses in staff is important, but often these data are not reported. Materials and Methods: We measured radiation exposure during 100 cases of percutaneous nephrolithotomy using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and {{the legs of the}} operating surgeon, the assistant, and the circulating nurse. Results: The mean screening time was 4. 5 minutes (range, 1 to 8 minutes) with mean fluoroscopy tube potential of 73 kVp, and mean tube current of 2. 8 mA. The estimated scatter exposure rate at 40 cm from the x-ray beam was 0. 47, 0. 04, 0. 21, and 4. 1 μGy to the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and thelegs of the operating surgeon, respectively. The estimated scatter exposure rate at different points from the x-ray beam was 0. 05, 0. 01, 0. 025, and 0. 1 μGy to the head, eye glasses, the fingers, and the legs of the assistant, respectively and the estimated scatter exposure rate at all different points from the x-raybeam for circulating nurse was 0 μGy. Conclusion: <b>Fluoroscopic</b> <b>screening</b> results in radiation exposure of the medical staff. The surgeon received the maximum radiation exposure, mostly to the legs and very least to the eyes. The assistant received less radiation exposure than the surgeon and the nurse did not receive significant amountof radiation...|$|R
