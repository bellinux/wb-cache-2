40|$|Machine-workable {{packaging}} materials by themselves do not guarantee trouble-free mechanical packaging. The adjustable machine parameters {{also have to}} be in conformity with the quantities of packaging material and machine. Tests with twelve commercial {{packaging materials}} on a pouch form-, fill- and seal-machine, type Transwrap 125 H, showed that only thick and relatively stiff packaging materials show a perceptible reaction upon changing of speed. Also the choice of the type of the side seam did not have a noticeable influence on the degree of the pull-off forces. On the other hand, the bag size proved to be very important: Small long pouches caused higher specific forces than the production of wide short pouches. For the user of machines {{it is very difficult to}} work with the <b>dancing</b> <b>roller</b> system which is important for the uniformity and also for the degree of the changing ofthe web tension while running. By the brake adjustment, the only possible adjustment, his influence on the web tension and especially on its temporal slope is quite limited...|$|E

25|$|The Generals grew a {{reputation}} for treating its players well and signed many young men who {{would go on to}} National Hockey League fame. Players were admitted free to theatres, <b>dancing,</b> wrestling, <b>roller</b> skating and other attractions at the arena. Sponsors gave full scholarships to school and weekly stipends. Through the whole dynasty, the team was managed by Matt Leyden, and its secretary was Neil Hezzlewood. Both men would be inducted in the Oshawa Sports Hall of fame.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Madonna's choreographer Jamie King, was a continuation from the [...] "Hung Up" [...] music video. It featured Madonna and her dancers roaming around {{a city in}} a van, <b>dancing</b> on <b>roller</b> skates and Madonna fighting {{with a group of}} men in a cage. She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video. An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song, which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction.|$|R
2500|$|The {{operators}} pioneered photography techniques {{which were}} never used in Soviet cinema: aerial lifts with cameras were hoisted over sets to create [...] "a cannon ball view". When filming Natasha's first ball, an operator with a hand-held camera circled between the <b>dancing</b> extras on <b>roller</b> skates. The crowd scenes were shot using cranes and helicopters. Another new feature {{was the use}} of a six-channel audio recording system by the sound technicians.|$|R
50|$|Freestyle <b>roller</b> <b>dancing</b> is a {{style of}} {{physical}} movement, usually done to music, that isn’t choreographed or planned ahead of time. It occurs in many genres, including those where people dance with partners. By definition, this kind of dance is never the same from performance to performance, although {{it can be done}} formally and informally, sometimes using some sparse choreography as a very loose outline for the improvisation.|$|R
50|$|When Haythorne was fourteen, {{he began}} his {{professional}} performing career with Harold Raymond's Varieties, a vaudeville troupe established initially as a concert party to entertain troops as World War II began. With Harold Raymond, he took part in comedy sketches, played his piano accordion, sang songs, and danced. His star act, which would feature again much later in his life, was his tap <b>dancing</b> routine on <b>roller</b> skates.|$|R

5000|$|P. Diddy (known then as Puff Daddy) {{produced}} [...] "Hypnotize" [...] and sampled {{the beat}} from Herb Alpert's 1979 hit [...] "Rise" [...] {{which was written}} by Andy Armer and Herb's nephew, Randy [...] "Badazz" [...] Alpert. Randy recalled, [...] "I asked Puffy, in 1996 when he first called me concerning using 'Rise' for 'Hypnotize,' why he chose the 'Rise' groove. He told me that {{in the summer of}} 1979 when he was I think 10 years old the song was a huge hit everywhere in New York and 'Rise' along with Chic's 'Good Times' were 'the songs' that all the kids were <b>dancing</b> and <b>roller</b> skating to that summer. He had always remembered that summer and that song. When he first played the loop for Biggie, (he said that) Biggie smiled and hugged him." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Rock DJ" [...] {{was directed by}} Vaughan Arnell. It begins with Williams <b>dancing</b> on a <b>roller</b> disco with girls skating around him. He wants {{to get the attention}} of the female DJ (played by Lauren Gold) standing above the stage, so he begins taking off his clothes. After he finally gets her attention he proceeds with stripping of his skin, muscles and organs, until the only thing left of him are his bones, which is performed by special effects. In the end, the DJ dances with his skeleton.|$|R
500|$|Melinda Newman {{from the}} website HitFix {{described}} Beyoncé's {{look in the}} video as [...] "sultry, slightly euphoric" [...] and noted its main theme being about comparing love to a carnival. She concluded that the video for [...] "XO" [...] is [...] "interesting... almost as if we're seeing her in some state of heightened reality enhanced by some mood-altering substance-- or maybe that's just what love does to Beyoncé." [...] Joe Lynch from Fuse commented that the shots of Beyoncé's smiles, children <b>dancing</b> and <b>roller</b> coaster throughout the video made it [...] "the most joyous music video of 2013". The same writer in another review said that the video shows Beyoncé [...] "at her most flippant, casual best". Michelle Collins from the Vanity Fair described the singer's look as [...] "young, carefree" [...] further describing the video as [...] "FOMO to the max". However, Whitney Phaneuf of the website HitFix gave a mixed review, comparing the video to Mariah Carey's [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) saying that the latter's clip made [...] "the roller coaster look better". The video was nominated in the category for Best Video at the 2014 World Music Awards.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{park was}} a simple nature park featuring Spring Creek, gorgeous landscaped gardens, and many walking paths for his citizens. He also added a structure for entertainment like <b>dancing</b> and <b>roller</b> skating, and helped institute a community band to perform there. The family-oriented park included children’s playgrounds, picnic pavilions, and baseball and athletic fields added in 1905. Spring Creek soon became a scenic boating lake. The park was a beautiful place in nature for all to enjoy, and even had impressive nighttime lighting. Hershey, PA’s growth and increased visitors to the town instilled a need for the park to evolve into an amusement park. A trolley was instituted in the place, {{as well as the}} park’s first ride in 1908: a used carrousel and band organ, and an amphitheater followed in 1909. Soon, the park began expanding each year. The carrousel, bandstand, and restaurant were enlarged in 1912, and a Convention Hall followed three years later. The very first roller coaster, Wild Cat, was introduced for the 20th anniversary, and the amusement park fad in the 1920s added a bumper cars ride and the Mill Chute water flume. After this period, although the Great Depression cast its shadow on the park, more new attractions and the Hershey Arena and Stadium were added.|$|R
5000|$|Compulsory dances, {{now called}} pattern dance in ice dancing, {{are a part}} of ice <b>dancing</b> and artistic <b>roller</b> skating in which all the couples or solo dancers perform the same {{standardized}} steps and holds to music of a specified tempo and genre. One or more compulsory dances were usually skated as the first phase of ice dancing competitions. The 2009-10 season was the final season in which the segment was competed in ISU junior and senior level competition. In June 2010, the International Skating Union replaced the name [...] "compulsory dance" [...] with [...] "pattern dance" [...] for ice dancing, and merged it into the short dance beginning in the 2010-2011 figure skating season. Compulsory dances are still skated in international roller skating competitions, however as in ice skating, a new section called the Style Dance [...] was introduced from the 2015/16 season alongside the standard compulsory dances and freedance categories. The style dance is very similar in structure to the short dance on ice.|$|R
