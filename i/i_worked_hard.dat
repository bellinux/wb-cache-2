He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to my faith in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E

[...] Josh Weinstein called {{it one of the}} most [...] "real" [...] episodes, commenting that every character in the episode, from Superintendent Chalmers to Lisa, acts like a real person throughout. The medic's line [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze" [...] is one of Matt Groening's favorites. Marge's line [...] "When I first met your father, he was loud, crude and piggish. But <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> on him, and now he's a whole new person", is one of Susie Dietter's favorites, as it explains why Marge is still married to Homer despite his actions.|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E

From 1940 until 1946 he attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he graduated with honors. He gained admission to Washington and Lee University, where he received a B.A. in History, graduating magna cum laude. He joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Robertson has said, [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools." ...|$|E
2500|$|Articles {{presented}} {{from the}} Korean-Americans' side stated that “Korean American merchants were apparently targeted by looters during the LA. Riots, {{according to the}} FBI official who directed federal law enforcement efforts during the disturbance.” The Korean American newspaper focused on the 1992 riots with Korean Americans being {{the center of the}} violence. Initial articles from late April and early May were about the stories depicting victims’ lives and the damage done to the LA Korean Community. Interviews with Koreatown merchants, such as Chung Lee, drew sympathy from its readers. Chung Lee, the model example of good merchant watched, helplessly, as his store was burned down. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> for that store.

2500|$|The demonstrations raised {{questions}} for Harvard students {{about their own}} role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called [...] "1%". Even participants struggled {{with the question of}} how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E

5000|$|Masta Killa {{is known}} for being the most quiet and mysterious member of the Wu-Tang Clan, and little is still known about him. He does not give many {{independent}} interviews. On the Wu-Tang Corp. website, Masta Killa stated, [...] "I know I seem serious and quiet {{to a lot of}} the fans. That's because <b>I</b> take my <b>work</b> seriously. It's not a game.

5000|$|Puyol {{was also}} known for his {{leadership}} and work ethic. He often continued training alone {{after the end of}} a team practice session or on days off. He said in 2010, [...] "I don't have Romário's technique, Marc Overmars' pace or Patrick Kluivert's strength. But <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> than the others.

60|$|There is a {{touch of}} the old spirit in me yet that bids me brave the tempest,--the spirit that, in spite of {{manifold}} infirmities, made me a roaring boy in my youth, a desperate climber, a bold rider, a deep drinker, and a stout player at single-stick, of all which valuable qualities there are now but slender remains. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> when I came in, and finished five pages.|$|E
60|$|I accepted, {{not without}} {{reluctance}} since with the impatience of youth I wanted everything at once. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> in that office and soon mastered the business, for {{my knowledge of}} figures--I had taken a first-class mathematical degree at college--came to my aid, as in a way did my acquaintance with Law and Literature. Moreover I had a certain aptitude for what is called high finance. Further, Fortune, as usual, showed me a favourable face.|$|E

60|$|There is no {{need for}} me to dwell upon my college career, but if any one were to take the trouble to consult the old records he would find that it was {{sufficiently}} brilliant. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard,</b> and I had a natural, perhaps an hereditary liking, for the work.

60|$|I was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and {{was left}} an orphan while I was yet {{a very young}} man, for my parents died {{within a few days}} of each other. I had {{inherited}} from them a small fortune, which <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> night and day to increase, till at last I found myself the owner of eighty camels. These I hired out to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompanied on their various journeys, and always returned with large profits.|$|E

40|$|An oft-cited oriental story {{describes}} {{a student who}} asked his teacher, “How {{long will it take}} me to master your discipline?” The teacher replied, “Ten years. ” The student said, “If <b>I</b> <b>work</b> twice as <b>hard,</b> {{how long will it take}} then?” “Twenty years. ” answered the teacher. Again the student said, “But if <b>I</b> <b>work</b> really <b>hard,</b> night and day, how long will it take me?” The teacher responded, “Thirty years. ” The student was confused, “How is it that if <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder,</b> you say that it will take longer?” The teacher replied, “Because when you keep one eye on the goal, you only have one eye with which to find the way. ” The moral of the story, namely, that the journey is more important than the destination, is perhaps difficult to apply in the pharmaceutical industry. How else, if not by keeping in mind that the goal of maintaining the highest standards of good practices is to guarantee patient safety, does one find the courage and justification to face the consequences of suspending the marketing authorisations of hundreds of medicinal products due to flawed studies?N/...|$|R
