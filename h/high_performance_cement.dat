40|$|International {{audience}} The {{addition of}} external nanoparticles, mainly nano silica during the hydration of cement {{is a field}} of investigation in <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>cements.</b> The added particles act as seeds and initiate early nucleation and subsequent growth of C-S-H gel. Nucleation is triggered very early, before enough clinker grains are dissolved or in other words, before the super saturation condition is attained.

Experimental studies in this area are less favored due to economic reasons and simulation studies are rare in the literature. An earlier work by some of the authors introduced a Monte Carlo model which dealt with the kinetics of the hydration process at early ages. The colloidal model incorporated random nucleation in the bulk, followed by an Avramian style layer by layer growth of 5 nm sized C-S-H particles. The model was based on a Random Sequential Addition scheme and enabled a satisfactory rationalization of the early growth of C-S-H gel.

40|$|Strength {{characteristics}} of cement based composites {{are affected by}} their microstructure: stronger cements have a much lower porosity which is often determined by their initial water/cement ratio. Conventionally cements are brittle materials with low tensile strength, but despite this, are widely used in construction. High strength cements are even more susceptible to catastrophic brittle failure than conventional cements, mainly because their (slightly) higher tensile strength leads to release of higher stored energy at failure. The work in this thesis follows an approach previously taken {{by members of the}} Chemistry and Engineering Departments at Aberdeen University to promote toughening in conventional cement pastes. The toughening mechanism depends strongly {{on the nature of the}} interface between angular inclusions and the continuous cement matrix. The situation is more complicated in <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>cements</b> because the matrix is more compacted so that controlling interfacial properties is more difficult. Pore reduced cement and silica fume blended cement are used as model high strength matrices. The increased density of conventional high strength pastes that results from the lower water cement ratio and better particle packing does not immediately lend itself to this toughening mechanism because of the expected increase in physical bond between matrix and aggregate. Despite these fears, increases in strength and fracture toughness have been achieved using both high strength matrices with the angular debonded inclusion toughening mechanism. The present study has also shown that the measured toughness can be used as a means of assessing the relative strength of the matrix angular aggregate interaction. In order to manufacture tougher materials it has been shown that the matrix should be stronger. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Thus, the use of HPFRCC may relieve the confinement requirements of members with highly congested reinforcement (Parra-Montesinos 2005).

For practical applications, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the fractural behavior of HPFRCCs to understand the mechanism of the microbehavior of a cement matrix containing reinforcing fibers.

The experimental parameters studied were: the type of fiber (polyethylene or polyvinyl alcohol), the hybrid type (with steel cord), and the loading pattern. The data shows that the progress of the damage in HPFRCCs in the compressive mode is characteristic of the type of hybrid fiber and its volume fraction. From the AE data, the second and third compressive load cycles resulted in a successive decrease in the amplitude compared to the first compressive load cycle. In addition, an AE Kaiser effect was observed in HPFRCCs specimens up to 80 % of their ultimate strength.

The first type of materials that have been investigated is the so called diluted magnetic semiconductors.

(Mn,Al) co-doped ZnO has been investigated regarding the Al significance on ferromagnetic behavior using density functional theory within the generalized-gradient approximation plus on-site Coulomb interaction. Despite the presence of Al the system always shows antiferromagnetic behavior. The role of intrinsic defects on ferromagnetism in pure and Cr doped In 2 O 3  was also studied. For pristine In 2 O 3, In vacancy and O interstitial states are completely spin polarized. Moreover, these hole states will create Cr ions in mixed valence state, giving rise to a strong ferromagnetic coupling. The second type of functional materials studied are hydrogen storage materials for mobile applications. These materials are considered as alternative if hydrogen is to replace fossil fuels as a energy carrier. In the view of this a series of compounds containing boron, nitrogen and hydrogen has been examined with respect to electronic structure, dehydrogenation energy and hydrogen diffusion properties. One compound, NH 3 BH 3, has many desirable properties as a hydrogen storage material.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of damage and failure in short fiber reinforced composites like <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> hybrid-fiber reinforced <b>cement</b> composites {{is still a}} challenging task, due to the richness of failure mechanisms introduced by fibers on the mesoscale of the material. Randomly oriented, hooked steel fibers, like the Baekaert Dramix ® fibers, sustainable modify the macroscopic failure behavior of the composite like increased compressive, tensile, flexural, and shear strength. On the mesoscale fibers introduce a multitude of additional mechanisms like fiber fracture, fiber bridging, fiber bending and matrix spalling for inclined fibers and finally fiber pull-out. Models for these materials must represent concrete as cohesive, frictional material with microstructure, and the different phases of fiber pull-out for 3 D randomly oriented fibers. The Discrete Element Model of Kun&Herrmann is extended by randomly throwing additional fibers with the projected fiber length on the disordered twodimensional system. We demonstrated a numerical study on the tensile and flexural failure behavior with the proposed model for brittle matrix material, reinforced with short, ductile fibers. We observe stiffening, strengthening, strain hardening and softening, depending on the fiber content...|$|R
