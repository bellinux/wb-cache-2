5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Hyderabadi garb {{also reveals}} {{a mix of}} Muslim and South Asian {{influences}} with men wearing sherwani and kurta–paijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez. Most Muslim women wear burqa and hijab outdoors. In addition to the traditional Indian and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths.|$|E
5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting {{in the loss of}} habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Another {{increasing}} {{issue is}} the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.|$|E

5|$|Between 1987 and 1998, the {{development}} corporation attracted 1,000companies, generating 28,299new jobs and £1.759billion of private sector investment. The setting {{up of the}} corporation {{was intended to be}} only a temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong {{financial}} centre matured in the 1990s, but was greatly {{affected by the}} Asian financial crisis in 1998, and again in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. A revival of external and domestic demand <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong recovery, as cost decreases strengthened the competitiveness of Hong Kong exports and a long deflationary period ended. Government intervention, initiated by the later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, {{with the introduction of}} export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E
5|$|John Carson as the {{replacement}} Captain Foster ("White Ghost"). A British actor {{of television and}} cinema, Carson's small-screen credits of the 1960s and 70s include The Saint, Man in a Suitcase, Department S and The Professionals, while his film roles include Plague of the Zombies (1966) and Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970). His appearances in The Troubleshooters {{attracted the attention of}} the Andersons. Carson's delivery of Foster's lines <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mistaken assertion that fellow British actor James Mason was cast for the role.|$|E

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper {{of a cat}} may function {{as a sort of}} surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis. There is some evidence that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai's {{culture is}} a blend of {{traditional}} festivals, food, music, and theatres. The city offers a cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle with a variety of food, entertainment, and night life, available in a form and abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as a major trading centre <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city. This unique blend of cultures is due to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.|$|E
