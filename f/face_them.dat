5|$|On September 27 {{episode of}} Raw Hall {{participated in a}} #1 Contenders Divas Battle Royal which was won by Natalya. In the middle to late 2010, Hall began a scripted rivalry with The Bella Twins (Brie and Nikki), teaming up with {{multiple}} partners, including Maryse and Alicia Fox to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> in tag team matches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, Hall {{continued}} her alliance with Melina, both teaming with her and accompanying her to the ring on numerous occasions. Hall was utilized mainly in a backup role throughout the next few months, teaming with Melina, as well as competing in a 12 wrestler tag team match at the Backlash pay-per-view in April, which her team won. In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with multiple partners, including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> in tag team matches. She continued to have a rivalry with Kelly throughout October, and was {{also a part of}} the winning team in a Raw versus SmackDown 10-wrestler tag team elimination match at Survivor Series in November, although she was eliminated by Maria.|$|E
5|$|Cyril's {{employment}} as a policeman causes Betty problems when Keith Lucas (David Webb), {{a man he}} has previously arrested, begins stalking her. She initially refrains from telling Cyril, fearing that he will get into trouble. When Cyril finds out, he attacks Lucas {{with a piece of}} lead piping and has to leave the police force. Betty has a breakdown when Cyril dies {{of a heart attack in}} 1974, leaving her only £859. The same year the truth about her illegitimate son is revealed, and when the community discovers this, Betty finds it difficult to <b>face</b> <b>them.</b> She busies herself by taking in lodgers, and acquiring a ginger cat named Marmaduke for extra companionship. Betty builds a relationship with Gordon, though he upsets her occasionally, particularly when he neglects to invite her to his wedding.|$|E

5|$|KroniK helped The Boogie Knights battle The Filthy Animals in {{subsequent}} matches at Mayhem and Millennium Final. As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, {{during which they}} helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing Reno and Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed {{as the one who}} had paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, as they turned on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.|$|E
5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to <b>face</b> <b>them.</b> Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} season, Halla lost the opening game against High1. However, they once again found themselves on top at {{the midpoint of}} the season. The team was second in the league in goals scored with 65. Halla retained Dustin Wood who was brought in as a replacement in {{the previous}} season. On 14 November 2010 the team defended their Korea Domestic Championship title against High1 by defeating them 5–1 in the final game of the week-long tournament. After finishing first two consecutive years, Halla finished in fourth place one point behind the Free Blades. They won their season series against all teams except the Cranes and Eagles. They also finished fifth in goals scored with 130, one behind High1, but allowed the second fewest goals with 94, three behind the Eagles. While the team's penalty kill was ranked fifth in the league, they were tied for the most short-handed goals with the Cranes with six goals. Their powerplay was ranked third, and they gave up the second fewest short-handed goals. Brock Radunske led the team with 20 goals and finished fourth in the league. Cho Min-ho also made the top ten ranking and finished in eight place with 18 goals. Kim Ki-sung was the only Halla player to make the top ten in assists and finished in tenth place with 27. Overall Cho Min-ho led the team with 44 points and finished ninth in the league. Dustin Wood led the team in penalty minutes with 45. With their fourth-place finish, Halla had to face the Eagles {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. The series began in Japan, but Halla took two of three games and upon returning to South Korea they won the fourth game of the best-of-five series and knocked the Eagles out. The Free Blades defeated the Cranes and Halla were set to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> on 12 March 2011 in Sendai, Japan. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Sendai area about one hour after the team landed there to prepare for the games. The League immediately cancelled the three games scheduled in Sendai and on 22 March 2011 they officially cancelled the final series, award co-championship titles to both Anyang Halla and Tohoku Free Blades. This decision made Halla only the second team to capture back-to-back championships since the league's inception.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana's {{total of}} seven tournament championships by {{the start of}} 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono, who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, {{finishing}} runner-up in the other six. He produced two more perfect scores of 15–0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to ōzeki Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takatōriki. The merger of his father's Fujishima stable with his uncle's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness.|$|E
25|$|At Lockdown on April 23, Steiner, Jarrett, and America's Most Wanted lost to Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino in a Lethal Lockdown match. Steiner and Jarrett then {{challenged}} Sting and {{a partner}} of his choosing to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> at Sacrifice on May 14. Sting hinted at three potential partners (Buff Bagwell, Lex Luger and Rick Steiner) before choosing Samoa Joe. Sting and Joe defeated Steiner and Jarrett.|$|E
25|$|To Upton's right, {{the brigade}} of Col. William S. Truex found {{a gap in}} the Confederate line, between the brigades of Clingman and Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford, through a swampy, brush-filled ravine. As Truex's men charged through the gap, Clingman swung two regiments around to <b>face</b> <b>them,</b> and Anderson sent in Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton's brigade from his corps reserve. Truex became {{surrounded}} on three sides and was forced to withdraw, although his men brought back hundreds of Georgian prisoners with them.|$|E

25|$|On October 6, 68 BC, the Romans {{approached}} the old capital of Artaxata. Tigranes' and Mithridates' combined Armeno-Pontian army of 70,000 men formed up to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> but were resoundingly defeated. Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans. However, the Armenian historians claim that Romans lost {{the battle of}} Artaxata and Lucullus' following withdrawal from the Kingdom of Armenia in reality was an escape due to the above-mentioned defeat. The Armenian-Roman wars are depicted in Alexandre Dumas' Voyage to the Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{playing for}} Cardiff in the 1905/06 season, Biggs missed the {{encounter}} between Cardiff {{and the first}} touring All Blacks team. The next season saw the first tour of the South African national side, and Biggs {{was part of the}} Cardiff team to <b>face</b> <b>them.</b> Of all the Cardiff players on that day only Biggs and Dicky David were uncapped at international level, and David would be selected to play for Wales in 1907. Cardiff beat the South Africans 17-0, made all the more impressive by the fact that Biggs was injured in the first few minutes of the game, which as good as reduced the team to 14 men.|$|E
25|$|The Devil's door: A {{moving target}} {{challenge}} pioneered by knifethrower Larry Cisewski. This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute {{a series of}} rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board {{not covered by the}} assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to <b>face</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|After a short career {{supporting}} German {{troop movements}} in central Africa, she was unexpectedly challenged by two motor boats, named HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou, {{which had been}} transported from Britain to the lake by an expedition led by Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson. The faster and more nimble motor boats were able to chase down Kingani, which was unable to bring her larger weapon {{to bear on the}} small vessels without turning to <b>face</b> <b>them.</b> After being hit several times and crippled, and with her commanding officer and several men dead, she surrendered and was brought back to the British base. Brought into British service as Fifi, she became the first German warship to be captured and transferred to the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|The Philistines {{make war}} again, {{assembling}} at Shunem, and Saul leads his army to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> at Mount Gilboa. Before the battle {{he goes to}} consult a medium or witch at Endor. The medium, unaware of his identity, reminds him that the king has made witchcraft a capital offence, but he assures her that Saul will not harm her. She conjures {{the spirit of the}} prophet Samuel, who before his death had prophesied that he would lose the kingdom. Samuel tells him that God has fully rejected him, will no longer hear his prayers, has given the kingdom to David and that the next day he will lose both the battle and his life. Saul collapses in fear, and the medium restores him with food in anticipation of the next day's battle.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 9 August 1945, through terrain {{believed}} by the Japanese to be impassable by armoured formations, the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. Red Army combined-arms forces achieved complete surprise {{and used a}} powerful, deep-penetrating attack in a classic double encirclement pattern, spearheaded by the T-34-85. The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been drawn off to other fronts and the remaining forces {{were in the middle}} of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from IJAAF forces, engineering, and communications. Japanese forces were overwhelmed, though some put up resistance. The Japanese emperor transmitted a surrender order on 14 August, but the Kwangtung Army was not given a formal cease fire until 17 August.|$|E

25|$|When Undertaker {{returned}} {{near the}} end of the Iron Man match between Triple H and The Rock at Judgment Day, he took out all the members of the McMahon-Helmsley Faction, which caused him to once again be a fan favorite. He also targeted their leader, then WWF Champion Triple H. At the King of the Ring pay-per-view, The Undertaker teamed with The Rock and Kane to defeat the team of Triple H, Shane McMahon, and Vince McMahon. Afterward, he was booked to team with Kane to contend for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. They defeated Edge and Christian, earning the right to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> the following week for the championship, which Edge and Christian retained. On the August 14 episode of Raw Is War, Kane betrayed The Undertaker by hitting him with a chokeslam twice, with the second one putting The Undertaker through the ring.|$|E
25|$|Anderson's {{attack was}} poorly coordinated and driven {{back by the}} heavy {{firepower}} of the Union cavalry's Spencer repeating carbines. By 9 a.m. Wright's lead elements arrived at the crossroads, but Wright decided to delay Grant's intended attack until after Smith arrived, which occurred in the afternoon, and the XVIII Corps men began to entrench {{on the right of}} the VI Corps. At 6:30p.m. the attack that Grant had ordered for the morning finally began. Both Wright's and Smith's corps moved forward. Wright's men made little progress south of the Mechanicsville Road, recoiling from heavy fire. North of the road, Brig. Gen. Emory Upton's brigade also met with heavy fire from Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman's brigade and fell back to its starting point. To Upton's right, the brigade of Col. William S. Truex found a gap in the Confederate line through a swampy, brush-filled ravine. As Truex's men charged through the gap, Clingman swung two regiments around to <b>face</b> <b>them,</b> and Anderson sent in Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton's brigade from his corps reserve. Truex became surrounded on three sides and was forced to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|When the National Wrestling Alliance Board of Directors {{decided to}} finally endorse a NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1992 they {{reached out to}} World Championship Wrestling to {{organize}} the initial tournament as well give them the rights to control the championship on a day-to-day basis. WCW pulled together a 16-team tournament that saw seven teams made up of regular WCW competitors as well as teams from various countries such as Japan, Mexico, Canada and more. The eight matches {{of the first round}} all took place on June 16, 1992 at WCW's Clash of the Champions XIX. During the show WCW started a storyline feud between WCW's top tag team, the Steiner Brothers, and the favorite non-WCW team of Steve Williams and Terry Gordy, who {{had been one of the}} top teams in Japan for years prior to the tournament. During the show Gordy and Williams attacked the Steiners' opponents prior to the match, leading to the Steiners winning by forfeit. During the show the Steiners challenged Gordy and Williams to <b>face</b> <b>them</b> in the second round that night instead of waiting for the next round. In the main event of the Clash of Champions Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to advance to the semi-finals. In the month between the first round and the rest of the tournament Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
