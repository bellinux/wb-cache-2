25|$|Others {{point out}} that these {{allegations}} fail to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> facing TCRT. Automobiles were more flexible than trains, didn't require the rider to abide by a schedule and afforded some privacy. A population growing more wealthy could afford such luxuries. Highway development enabled settlement over a wider area. Minneapolis' population peak in the late 1940s and St. Paul's a decade later in the late 1950s. Population growth and job growth was spread out in less dense suburbs where capital requirements for building new rail were too high compared to the potential ridership. Building rails to service these areas was cost prohibitive. Buses though could be profitable on such routes. More so other streetcar lines without connection to NCL also converted to buses, frequently having done so long before the TCRT began the process.|$|E

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”.

2500|$|The First Bulgarian Empire was a {{hereditary}} monarchy. The monarch {{was responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> {{of peace and}} war.

After 864 Boris I adopted the Slavic Knyaz (Prince), and since 913 the Bulgarian monarchs were recognised as Tsars (Emperors). The authority of the Khan was limited by the leading noble families and the People's Council. The People's Council included the nobility and the [...] "armed people" [...] was gathered to discuss issues of crucial importance for the state. A People's Council in 766 dethroned Khan Sabin because he was seeking peace with the Byzantines.

The hour, in whose coming I had acquiesced, was approaching so quickly and was already so near that the sense of finality was bearing upon me! The issue was perhaps life or death to any of us; but for this we were all prepared. Margaret and I were one as to the risk.

60|$|The broker {{said there}} was; and I was {{astonished}} when Haldane {{suggested that we}} might as well attend it, for this part of the conflict was evidently to be fought on wholly novel lines. We drove to the meeting, and after the monotony of Crane Valley the sight of the light-hearted crowd, the hum of voices and laughter, the gay dresses, and, above all, the horses, was exhilarating. Nevertheless, it was some time before the scene compelled my whole attention, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of the business which had brought me to Winnipeg appeared far too serious to justify such trifling. By degrees, however, I yielded to the influence of the stirring spectacle, and was at length amazed to find myself shouting wildly with the rest when a handsome chestnut broke out from the ruck of galloping horses a furlong from the post. Then, indeed, for a few seconds I was oblivious of everything but the silk-clad figure and the beautiful animal rushing past the dim sea of faces in the blaze of sunshine behind, while the roar of hoofs and the human clamor set me quivering. It was all so different from anything I had heard or seen on the silent prairie. Boone returned presently, and I stared at the silver coins he placed in my palm.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} of government issues(253) of paper money again came [...] {{up in the}} United States in 1862, during the civil war, and part of [...] our present currency {{is the result of}} the policy then adopted. The [...] first step—the one that generally costs—however, was taken July [...] 17, 1861, when the Treasury issued $50,000,000 of “demand notes,” [...] not bearing interest. These notes, however, were not made legal [...] tender. They could be used in payment of salaries and other dues [...] from the United States. It may be well to state that the Treasury [...] balanced the arguments for and against the issues of paper at the [...] beginning of the experiment, and we can see how these views were [...] realized as we go along. In favor of paper issues it was urged [...] that we could borrow a large amount without interest, as in the [...] case of the Continental currency; that there would be no expense [...] beyond the coin necessary for keeping the paper at par; and that [...] the country would gain a uniform currency. On the other hand, it [...] was seen that there might be temptations to issue without [...] provisions for redemption; that even if a fund were kept, a [...] disturbance of the money market would precipitate a demand for [...] coin, and all upon this single fund; and, lastly, that there were [...] all the dangers of over-issue. Secretary Chase(254) then decided [...] against paper issues. Government bonds, however, did not sell, and [...] the attempt of the banks toward the end of 1861 to carry [...] $150,000,000 of bonds brought on a suspension of specie payments, [...] December 31, 1861. Without any taxation policy, the country [...] drifted along, until in a spasm of dread at seeing an empty [...] Treasury, Congress passed the legal-tender act (February 25, [...] 1862), issuing $150,000,000 of paper in the form of promises to [...] pay. A committee of bankers showed that the issue could have been [...] avoided by selling bonds at their market price; but Congress would [...] not sell them below par. No necessity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of paper need [...] have arrived. In four months another issue of $150,000,000 was [...] authorized (July 11, 1862); and a third issue of a like amount [...] (March 3, 1863), in all $450,000,000. The depreciation took place [...] (see Chart No. XII), for, as Secretary Chase anticipated, no [...] provision was made for redemption. They were made legal tender, [...] but this “essential idea” did not preserve their value; nor did [...] the provision that they be received for taxes (except customs), [...] avail for this purpose.|$|E
