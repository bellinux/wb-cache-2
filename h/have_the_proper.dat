5|$|All {{registered}} Colorado Ranger Horses trace {{directly to}} one of two foundation sires in their pedigree. The first is Patches #1 and the second is Max #2, a son of another horse named Max born in 1918. Registered Colorado Rangerbreds may be bred to registered Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Appaloosas, Arabians and AraAppaloosas, and the resulting progeny registered as purebred Colorado Rangerbreds. Horses with draft horse or pony blood may not be registered. Colorado Ranger Horses may be double-registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club, but Appaloosas may not be registered with the CRHA unless they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> bloodlines. Approximately 90 percent of Colorado Ranger horses are dual-registered.|$|E
5|$|The Wilderness Act of 1964 {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including even bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, {{just as they are}} throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> licenses and permits.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

25|$|Pāhoehoe is {{characterized}} by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows.

After the end of the ground war, he was invited to join the inspection team attempting to find any trace {{of weapons of mass destruction}} programmes and was apparently enthusiastic about resuming his work there. He made two attempted trips to Iraq. The first was on 19 May 2003 when he was prevented from entering Iraq from Kuwait because he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> documents.|$|E

The injury, a torn labrum, required surgery that prematurely ended his 2009 campaign. Satele submitted a medical exemption application to the NCAA in order to attempt a comeback with the Warriors in 2010 however, the application was denied as the NCAA determined that Satele did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> documentation to prove he redshirted the 2005 season due to injury. Following the ruling, Satele was made eligible to enter the NFL.|$|E
25|$|Status {{in early}} Ireland {{was not entirely}} rigid and it was {{possible}} for a family to raise its status. If three consecutive generations—grandfather, father, and son—had the property qualifications of a lord, or the poetic qualifications of a higher level poet, etc., then the member of the third generation became a lord. On the other hand, the son or grandson of a lord, or a poet, etc., who did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> qualifications, did not have that status. However, the grandson of a person with a certain status could have that status themselves, assuming they had the proper qualifications, even if their father did not.|$|E

Nevertheless, the airport still owns nearly 2000 acres of unused land around the airport that it wants to develop. Some ideas for developing that land include an airport hotel or warehouse facilities. For air service, the airport is looking at several domestic destinations including Portland and San Diego for new non-stop air service. With the addition of the Paris flight, Raleigh is now looking into a transpacific flight, possibly to somewhere in India, the Middle East or China where companies such as Lenovo have frequent business flights.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} form of coarse-graining is {{the united}} atom (sometimes called extended atom) and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH3 methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH2 methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that {{have the capability to}} participate in hydrogen bonds (polar hydrogens). An example of this is the CHARMM 19 force-field.|$|E

25|$|A spherical contact lens bends light evenly {{in every}} {{direction}} (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A toric contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, {{and as a result}} can correct for astigmatism. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a toric lens must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.|$|E
25|$|Olfactory {{memory has}} also been {{developed}} throughout evolution to help animals recognize other animals. It is suggested that smell allows for young infants to identify with their mothers or for humans to identify between males and females. Olfaction cues were also used, and are still used, by many animals to mark territory, protecting themselves from other threats to their survival. While the development of other sensory systems, such as the visual system and auditory systems, has decreased how reliant some animals are on the olfactory system, there is still evidence that shows these animals’ olfactory systems still have a strong influence on their social interactions. The memory for specific odorants gives the animal an opportunity to communicate {{with members of the}} same species and allows for lack of communication between species that do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> receptor systems for the odor. These chemical signals can also be sensed in the dark or even under water.|$|E
