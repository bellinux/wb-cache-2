How well could they align themselves {{in all the}} legislation frameworks and calculation tools for the sustainable construction products? In accordance with the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) [1], determining of ecological properties of construction products could be accomplished with applying life cycle assessment (LCA). There is a number of tools and frameworks for evaluating the sustainability of construction products for the European experts, which {{may be used in}} such a decision-making process. However, for a non-expert user, this could be quite complex. Therefor, the assumption here is that environmental and human health safety are prior in contrast to the market prices when it comes to choosing a <b>decorative</b> <b>paint</b> or <b>coating.</b> In the framework of herein research, an Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process model was designed involving four major merits of the Analytic Hierarchy Process: Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks [2]. The model which is based on the major characteristics of a <b>decorative</b> wall <b>paint</b> helps emphasising the best alternative with respect to given priorities: low risk of environmental and human health damage, quality, market price, repairability. The model shows values for all the criteria and alternatives with respect to pairwise comparisons. In a future research step, this model will be validated with a questionnaire survey targeting non-expert users, i. e. average consumers, on the construction market in Germany...|$|R

Domestic {{science of}} folk art has {{originated}} and has been developing primarily as a study of archaeological antiquities and artistic monuments of the past. Scientific papers, which comprehended the process of folk art development, began to appear in the late nineteenth century, Archaeological Congresses became the impetus for their appearance. Being a representative of the <b>decorative</b> <b>painting,</b> Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> is rooted by its murals to Tripoli. It was created as a peasant domestic drawing. Inexhaustible diversity of local variants of Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting,</b> its evolutionary change, the individual characteristics of paintings of hundreds of famous Ukrainian artists do not even allow comparing it to any other European counterparts, each of which is characterized only by some individual techniques. Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> got the significant boost in its distribution and development when it «came down» from walls to paper. Paper pictures - malyovky - were stucked to walls following the traditional rules of domestic interior’s decoration. Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> got the official status in 1913, when E. Evenbah, by the initiative of D. I. Yavornytsky, gathered the collection of Petrikivsky decorative painting’s malyovkas and organized the exhibition in St. Petersburg. Motives of painting are rooted into the local flora and fauna and into the historical tradition. However, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> is not a direct reflection of natural motifs. World, created in paintings, is the product of the imagination of folk artist, it is the stylization of local flowers, fruits and birds. First names of Masters of Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting,</b> which appeared in historical sources, were T. Pata, N. Bilokin, I. Pavlenko. Their official recognition happened in 1930 after their participation in the first republican exhibition, which was later shown in Kiev, Moscow, Leningrad. Their students and followers are well-known now masters G. Prudnykov, V. Kucherenko, V. Sokolenko, F. Panko, E. Klyupa, I. Zavgorodniy Z. Kudish, M. Shyshatska, N. Szulik and others. The two-year school of <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> was opened in Petrikivka village in 1936, first teachers there were O. Stativa A. and T. Pata. There are a lot of exhibitions, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> is being introduced abroad. In 1958 F. Panko gathered some masters into the plant of varnished production, which was later modified into the factory of artistic products  «Druzhba». Experimental art studio, organized by him in 1970, was converted into  the center of folk art «Petrykivka» in 1991.  Due to its high decorative properties, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> blends into the exterior and interior of modern buildings both by walls painting and by the use of paintings and dishes. It is used in advertising, printing and souvenir production. In 2013 Petrykivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> was declared an intangible cultural heritage of humanity by UNESCO...|$|R
