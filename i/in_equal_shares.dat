25|$|To {{alleviate}} this fundamentally flawed {{state of}} affairs, Skidmore {{argued for the}} end of the right of inheritance and for the strict leveling of property among adults. His program was straightforward: all property in the United States should be divvied up and redistributed, <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>shares,</b> to American citizens. From that point on, Americans would own their share as private property, and would relinquish it only when they died. Private inheritance would be abolished, and the wealth of the deceased would be pooled into a fund and reserved, in the future, for young people when they reached the age of 18. Upon reaching that age, all Americans would inherit a generous sum of money, understood as their birthright, to get them started in adult life.|$|E

To avoid massive increases in premiums, the government reformed the system in 1986 by cutting benefit levels and raising the plan's specified age at which benefits began from 60 to 65. Under the revised system, contributions paid <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>share</b> by employer and employee {{were expected to be}} equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system.

Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>shares</b> to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the {{immediate}} effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843, while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the spirit of a man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on purpose trust. Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on resulting trust for donors upon the failure of the purpose trust. Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as bona vacantia. The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the contractual provisions identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{policies}} for sharing {{resources that are}} characterized by low level of fairness (see fairness measures) provide high average throughput but low stability in the service quality, meaning that the achieved service quality is varying in time depending {{on the behavior of}} other users.

[...] Max-min fair resource sharing results in higher average throughput (or system spectral efficiency in wireless networks) and better utilization of the resources than a work-conserving <b>equal</b> <b>sharing</b> policy of the resources. <b>In</b> <b>equal</b> <b>sharing,</b> some dataflows {{may not be able to}} utilize their [...] "fair share" [...] of the resources.

The company said it considered the surplus the rightful property of the employer (Dominion Stores Ltd.), as the shareholders {{would have to pay}} for any shortfall if the assets had been less successfully invested. The Dominion Union complained, a public outcry ensued, and the case went to court. The Supreme Court of Ontario ruled against the company, and ordered the company to return the money to the pension fund, claiming that though the most recent language in the plan suggested the employer had ownership of the surplus, the original intention was to keep the surplus in the plan to increase members' benefits. Eventually, the pension dispute was settled <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>shares</b> between the shareholders and the plan members.|$|E

Lear then summons the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France, who have both proposed marriage to Cordelia. Learning that Cordelia has been disinherited, the Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit, but the King of France is impressed by her honesty and marries her nonetheless. The King of France is shocked by Lear's decision because up until this time Lear has only praised and favored Cordelia ("[...] [...] she, who even but now was your best object, the argument of your praise, balm of your age [...] [...] [...] [...] ").

40|$|A {{new class}} of prediction-based neural {{networks}} (PBNNs) for temporal pattern classification is proposed. Our approach combines the universal neural network approximator and the time delay neural network. The input vectors of PBNN are consecutively created from the time-delayed segment of a pattern. The network is robust since all input segments contribute <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>share</b> to the classification result. To demonstrate the feasibility of PBNN, extensive simulations on ECG classification have been conducted. For a comparative study, we have included another independent training classifier-hidden Markov model (HMM). We have {{also included in the}} study some mutually training models, e. g. the (static) decision-based neural network (DBNN). PBNNs have all reported respectable training performance and relatively good generalization accuracy. Hybrid PBNN and MT techniques are also proposed to further improve classification accuracy. 本文提出一個新的預估類神經網路，並將它應用至時序樣本分績。所提出的預估 類神經網路結合了通用近似器以及時間延遲類神經網路。其輸入向量是由原輸入時序樣本 的不同延遲時間區段所組合而成。因為所有輸入資料區段對分類的結果都有相等的貢獻， 所以此一網路具有不錯的強健性。我們使用許多心電圖分類的實驗來測試預估類神經網路 的有效性。為了比較預估類神經網路的效能，我們也測試了獨立訓練的隱藏式馬可夫模型 分類器以及交互訓練的類神經網路。預估類神經網路對於訓練樣本的錯誤率很低，而測試 樣本的錯誤率也較其他方法低。我們也提出了混合預估類神經網路以及交互訓練技術的方 法，以進一步提高分類的正確率...|$|R

When the day comes for distributing luxuries, old ladies will not want their quota of cigars, nor young men their just proportion of lap-dog; this will make it necessary to know how many cigars are the equivalent of one lap-dog.
