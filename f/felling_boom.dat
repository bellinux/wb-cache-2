Australian surfer Wayne [...] "Rabbit" [...] Bartholomew describes such events vividly in his book Bustin’ Down the Door including an episode where he was attacked and lost some of his teeth.|$|R

60|$|The cannon {{which had}} been {{suspended}} {{from the end of}} this <b>boom</b> <b>fell</b> into the sea, and would have crashed down upon the roof of Crab K, had not that vessel, in obedience to a signal from the repeller, loosened its hold upon the Adamant and retired a short distance astern. Material injury might not have resulted from the fall of this great mass of metal upon the crab, but it was considered prudent not to take useless risks.|$|R
30|$|This study {{investigated}} data sets from four stands, and very accurate tree location {{was available for}} two of these. The tree-location data for the remaining two sites were collected by a harvester and contained some inaccuracies associated with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) recording under forest canopy and the physical dislocation of the GNSS. The GNSS unit is on the cabin of the machine, but the tree is <b>felled</b> using a <b>boom</b> and could be up to 12  m from the cabin.|$|R
500|$|Despite this, {{serious illness}} {{remained}} rare {{and the first}} convict death was from accidental causes rather than disease. On 24 July the ship's longboat <b>fell</b> from a <b>boom</b> and struck 22-year-old Jane Bonner in the head; she died from her injuries six days later. A second convict, John Hartley, died of unknown causes on 5 August. [...] The fact that Hartley was flogged, as punishment for the alleged planned mutiny, {{may have contributed to}} his poor health and subsequent death. [...] These two deaths compared favourably with those on other transports, particularly Alexander; Alexander recorded 30 deaths, a consequence of overcrowding and an overflowing bilge.|$|R
5000|$|Boyle went to sea aboard {{during the}} American War of Independence, {{he went out}} in , and on {{returning}} home {{was sent to a}} naval academy at Greenwich. He entered the Royal Navy on 12 September 1780, serving as a midshipman on board the frigate [...] frigate, commanded by Sir Hyde Parker. In this ship he was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank between the squadron under the command of Sir Hyde Parker, the father of the Latonas captain, and a Dutch force under Admiral Johan Zoutman. Some time later he <b>fell</b> from the <b>booms</b> into the orlop, and was obliged to go on shore to recover.|$|R
30|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, {{of the four}} {{countries}} compared in Fig.  1, Germany had the highest disability recipiency rate. One element that potentially contributed to this high rate was a change in WDP rules in 1969. The reform <b>fell</b> into the <b>booming</b> post-WWII era when the social welfare state was expanded. This particular reform allowed partially disabled workers to receive full WDP benefits if {{they were unable to}} find a job (Burkhauser and Hirvonen, 1989). Further expansions in 1972 extended coverage to housewives and the self-employed. It also provided gateways to the retirement program at age 62 without actuarial benefit reductions. As seen in Panel A of Fig.  3, {{in the aftermath of the}} reforms, disability recipiency rose significantly, peaking at 5.8 [*]% in 1984.|$|R
60|$|Glancing round, however, he saw {{something}} which was more dangerous to his plans than {{the resistance of the}} enemy. The wind, which had become more fitful and feebler, now fell suddenly away, until the sails hung limp and straight above them. A belt of calm lay along the horizon, and the waves around had smoothed down into a long oily swell on which the two little vessels rose and <b>fell.</b> The great <b>boom</b> of the Marie Rose rattled and jarred with every lurch, and the high thin prow pointed skyward one instant and seaward the next in a way that drew fresh groans from the unhappy Aylward. In vain Cock Badding pulled on his sheets and tried hard to husband every little wandering gust which ruffled for an instant the sleek rollers. The French master was as adroit a sailor, and his boom swung round also as each breath of wind came up from astern.|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the Bakken went boom. Thanks to {{advances}} in hydraulic fracturing, oil production in western North Dakota exploded. As {{the price of}} oil went up, so did the oil rigs. People came {{from all over the country}} (and the world) in search of work, and cities and towns struggled to keep up. This book is about the challenges they faced. It is about the human dimensions of the boom, as told by artists, poets, journalists, and scholars. It captures the boom at its peak, before {{the price of oil}} <b>fell</b> and the <b>boom</b> went bust. This is the only book on the Bakken to bring together such a wide range of voices. It captures a fascinating moment in the history not only of North Dakota, but of global oil production. It sheds light on the impact of oil on local communities that, until now, had not attracted much interest from the outside world. And it shows how North Dakotans, both old and new, have found ways to address the challenges they face in a turbulent, changing environment...|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 5 January 1856, Benjamin Peirce was {{anchored}} in the St. Johns River off Jacksonville, Florida, when the steamer SS Seminole caught fire at a pier upstream shortly before midnight. Burning from stem to stern, Seminole was cut loose from her moorings so that the flames would not spread to buildings ashore and began to drift down onto Benjamin Peirce. By the time the senior officer aboard Benjamin Peirce, Sailing Master P. R. Hawley, could get her crew on deck, Seminole was only 50 yards (46 meters) away. Leaving half of Benjamin Peirces men aboard with buckets and axes to prevent flames from spreading to her if Seminole drifted onto her, Hawley took {{the rest of the}} men out in a boat to attempt to tow Seminole away from Benjamin Peirce. The boat managed to pull Seminole far enough for her only to strike a glancing blow against Benjamin Peirce, although Seminole passed the survey schooner so closely that the intense heat of the fire destroyed Benjamin Peirces foresail, mainsail, main gaff-top-sail, starboard main shrouds and main topmast back-stay and some of her running rigging. The flames also charred most of Benjamin Peirces spars, both of her masts, her starboard bulwarks, her galley, her cabin quarter-house, and her deck, damaged a new boat lying on her deck, and broke the glass in the skylight of her cabin quarter-house. Her main <b>boom</b> <b>fell</b> when the topping lift which supported it was destroyed, and it crushed her taffrail when it fell. Despite this damage, Hawleys quick action had prevented Seminole from becoming entangled with Benjamin Peirce, which probably would have resulted in the destruction of Benjamin Peirce.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, out in {{the black}} night before us, and not two hundred yards away, we heard, {{at a moment when}} the wind was silent, the clear note of a human voice. Instantly the wind swept howling down upon the Head, and the Roost bellowed, and churned, and danced with a new fury. But we had heard the sound, and we knew, with agony, that this was the doomed ship now close on ruin, and that what we had heard was the voice of her master issuing his last command. Crouching {{together}} on the edge, we waited, straining every sense, for the inevitable end. It was long, however, and to us it seemed like ages, ere the schooner suddenly appeared for one brief instant, relieved against a tower of glimmering foam. I still see her reefed mainsail flapping loose, as the <b>boom</b> <b>fell</b> heavily across the deck; I still see the black outline of the hull, and still think I can distinguish the figure of a man stretched upon the tiller. Yet the whole sight we had of her passed swifter than lightning; the very wave that disclosed her fell burying her for ever; the mingled cry of many voices at the point of death rose and was quenched in the roaring of the Merry Men. And with that the tragedy was at an end. The strong ship, with all her gear, and the lamp perhaps still burning in the cabin, the lives of so many men, precious surely to others, dear, at least, as heaven to themselves, had all, in that one moment, gone down into the surging waters. They were gone like a dream. And the wind still ran and shouted, and the senseless waters in the Roost still leaped and tumbled as before.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{approximately}} 3 billion m 3 of wood is harvested {{and removed}} from forests annually. Forest plantations {{play an important}} role in forest harvesting providing 46 % of the total industrial roundwood produced in the world, while they account for only 7 % of the world’s forested area. Modern harvesting systems are mechanised for productivity, costs, and safety reasons. Due to the advances and availability of both computing and sensor technologies, mechanised machinery is a platform for integration of these technologies with electronic control systems capable of monitoring machine functions, estimating measurements, and recording data. One of the most popular mechanized harvesting systems is Cut-To-Length (CTL). The CTL system typically consists of two types of machines, a harvester, which fells and processes the trees into logs in the stand, and a forwarder that extracts the logs. CTL machines were developed in Scandinavia and are now used worldwide. They are the preferred technology for harvesting fast growing forest plantations in some South American countries such as Uruguay. Harvesters are equipped with a system called StanForD that provides a mechanism to automatically record data from forest harvesters in a series of file formats. When harvesters are equipped with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, these data include a locational reference and a time stamp. GNSS-enabled data provide site-specific information that is a valuable input for both stand level forest management and harvesting operation assessment. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the usefulness of GNSS-enabled StanForD files as a tool for evaluating variables affecting harvesting operations and the forest management process. To achieve the objective two independent studies were carried out. Chapter 2 explores opportunities to manage harvesting operations. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the geospatial and time information contained in StanForD files to model harvester productivity. A harvester dataset obtained from Uruguay comprised over 63, 000 cycles of felled and processed stems (stm files) and 1440 shift hours (drf files). With two thirds of this cycle time data, a mixed effects model was fitted to evaluate harvester productivity as a function of stem diameter at breast height (DBH), species, shift (day/night), slope, and operator. A slope surface derived from a digital terrain model was overlaid with GNSS stem records. The reserved third of the data was used to validate the model. DBH was the most influential variable in harvester productivity, showing a positive correlation and a R 2 value of 0. 73 in the validation model. Operator and species also had significant effects. There was no significant slope effect, whereby the study area only had flat and mildly sloping terrain. Shift did not have a significant effect, indicating there was no drop in night shift productivity. The model developed constitutes the first published harvester productivity model in South America based on data automatically collected by harvesters. Chapter 3 and 4 explore opportunities to provide feedback to improve the forest management process using the site-specific harvester data. Stand productivity of fast-growing forest plantation varies across short distances depending on site and forest characteristics. As plantation forest silviculture is typically resource intensive in establishment, forest management would benefit from a site-specific approach. A tool to characterize such stand productivity variations are yield maps and a cost effective source of data is automatically collected by harvesters. To create such maps we need to understand the effect of geospatial accuracy of tree location recorded by the harvester. The objective of Chapter 3 is to improve our understanding of spatial resolution for studying variations in volume and stocking across forested stands, and establish guidance for actual spatial resolution that would allow the development of fit-for-purpose forest yield maps from harvester data. This study investigated data sets from seven stands: two had very accurate tree location, and five were harvester data files that have inaccuracy associated with both the GNSS recording under forest canopy and the physical dislocation of the GNSS relative to the harvested tree location. The GNSS unit is on the cabin of the machine, but the tree is <b>felled</b> using a <b>boom</b> and could be up to 12 meters from the cabin. A spatial resolution for studying variations in stand productivity and stocking across stands was established to allow the development of forest yield maps from harvester data. By assessing the variability across a range of cell sizes, it was concluded that a cell size between 40 and 60 m is suitable to use as a reference for calculating volume per hectare and stocking. Based on the outputs of Chapter 3, the objective of Chapter 4 was to develop models to map stand productivity from GNSS enabled harvester data. This chapter first explores several models using the same two stands with accurate tree location used in Chapter 3. It assesses their accuracy, then applies the models to the harvester data stands, and finally compares the results of the models to determine the most suitable models. The assessment of the models includes the comparison of productivity maps created from inventory plots. Chapter 5 is a synthesis of the findings, contributions, limitations of the studies, and views on future research needs resulting from this work.
