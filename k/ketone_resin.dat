40|$|The acetone-formaldehyde resin {{designated}} as <b>Ketone</b> <b>Resin</b> (KR) was prepared with more hydroxy functionalized groups. It was then acrylated by treatment with acrylol choride. The resultant acrylated KR {{designated as}} AKR {{was characterized by}} number of double bonds and IR spectral study. The blending of AKR with commercial unsaturated polyester (USPE) was carried out with various proportions. The curing of these USPE-AKR blends was carried out using Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as a catalyst and N, N’-Dimethyl aniline (DMA) as a promoter. The glass fiber reinforced composites (i. e., laminates) of these USPE-AKR blends were fabricated. The mechanical and chemical resistance properties of the glass fiber composites have also been evaluated. The unreinforced cured samples of the USPE-AKR blends were also analyzed by thermogravimetry (TGA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of three low-molecular weight resins used as paint varnishes {{has been characterized}} by use of an approach based on three different mass spectrometric techniques. We investigated the <b>ketone</b> <b>resin</b> MS 2 A, the aldehyde resin Laropal A 81, and the hydrocarbon resin Regalrez 1094, now commonly used in restoration. To date, the {{molecular structure}}s of these resins have not been completely elucidated. To improve current knowledge of the chemical composition of these materials, information obtained by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–Q–ToF) was combined. Analysis, in solution, of the whole polymeric fraction of the resins by flow-injection ESI–Q–ToF, and of the non-polymeric fraction by GC/MS, enabled us to identify previously unreported features of the polymer structures. In addition, the Py–GC/MS profiles that we obtained will help to enhance the databases currently available in the literature. The proposed approach can be extended to other low-molecular-weight resins used as varnishes in conservation...|$|E
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of performance characteristics of resins {{was always an}} issue for the conservation community, since {{the stability of the}} art objects depends on the service life of conservation materials used. Among the resins commonly applied in the field of paintings conservation, four of the most popular ones, Paraloid B 72, Primal AC 33 (acrylic polymers), <b>Ketone</b> <b>Resin</b> N (cyclohexanone) and Laropal A 81 (ureaaldehyde) were selected to be comparatively studied under accelerated ageing conditions. These resins have been used by the art conservators either as consolidant materials of the paint or as protecting varnishes for the painting surface. The behaviour of the coatings under thermal ageing was investigated following a methodology depositing films of all materials onto different solid substrates (silicon wafers, quartz and simple glass slides) depending on the method of analysis used. Accelerated thermal ageing tests were conducted at 100 oC, for up to 432 hours. The morphological characteristics of the resins films (crack formations and surface alterations, coherence of film layers, thickness and surface roughness) were examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chemical changes of the resins were studied with FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, while colour properties and thermal-chemical stability were also studied with spectrocolorimetry. It was found that, although all four displayed changes concerning their colour and film thickness, the two acrylic polymers and the aldehyde resin exhibit high stability against chemical degradation compared to the cyclohexanone based resin. Complementary solubility and swelling testing were also applied and significantly aided in supporting the spectroscopy observations. Finally, microscopic examination of most resin films revealed cracking features which may sometimes render them unsuitable for application under uncontrollable conditions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Experiments with poly ether <b>ketone</b> <b>ketone</b> (PEKK) <b>resin</b> and AS- 4, IM- 7, and G 30 - 500 fibers showed {{excellent}} {{correlation between}} resin/fiber contact angle and composite transverse flexural strength as measures of resin/fiber interfacial strength. Both tests indicate the strongest interface for G 30 - 500 /PEKK followed by IM- 7 /PEKK and AS- 4 /PEKK. Also discussed are fiber effects on interlaminar fracture {{and on the}} in-situ crystallization of the matrix during composite fabrication...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the AE cluster {{analysis}} methodology {{was applied to}} investigate the peculiarities of the AE evolution and clustering in thermoset and thermoplastic reinforced 2 D carbon and glass textiles. One thermoset (Epoxy) and two thermoplastic (Polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) and Polyether ether <b>ketone</b> (PEEK)) <b>resins</b> were considered. The epoxy was reinforced with balanced twill 2 x 2 carbon fabric and balanced twill 2 x 2 glass fabric. The PPS and the PEEK were reinforced with carbon plain weave textile. The comparison of the cumulative energy of AE events show that the thermoplastics reinforced composites have an early beginning of the damage and rapid saturation while a later beginning and more continuous growth of the damage was monitored in the textiles reinforced epoxy materials. The cluster analyses highlighted that the thermoset and thermoplastic reinforced composites have a net separation of the clusters. The crack monitoring in the thickness allowed the preliminary correlation of the transverse cracks in the PPS reinforced composite to the cluster containing AE events of low amplitude and low frequency...|$|R
40|$|A novel PTFE-reinforced self-humidifying {{membrane}} {{based on}} low-cost sulfonated poly (ether ether <b>ketone)</b> (SPEEK) <b>resin</b> was fabricated. In the membrane a base layer {{and a thin}} protective layer were bonded by porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film. The base layer, which is composed of silicon oxide supported platinum catalyst (abbreviated as Pt-SiO 2) dispersed in SPEEK resin, can suppress reactant crossover and achieve good membrane hydration due to the imbedded hygroscopic Pt-SiO 2 catalysts. The thin protective layer, which constitutes of H 2 O 2 decomposition catalyst Pt-SiO 2 and high H 2 O 2 -tolerant Nafion resin, aims to prevent the SPEEK resin degradation by H 2 O 2 produced at the cathode side by incomplete reduction of oxygen. The porous PTFE film tightly bonds with the SPEEK and the Nation resins to form an integral membrane and accordingly to avoid delamination of the two different resins. The self-humidifying membrane was characterized by TEM, SEM and EDS, etc. The self-humidifying membrane exhibits higher open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0. 98 V and maximum power density value of 0. 8 W cm(- 2) than 0. 94 V, 0. 33 W cm(- 2) of SPEEK/PTFE membrane under dry condition, respectively. The primary 250 h fuel cell durability experiment was conducted and suggested that this low-cost self-humidifying membrane was durable both on fuel cell performance and the membrane structure under fuel cell operation condition with dry H- 2 /O- 2.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to generate reinforcing domains in situ during the processing of polymers by using phase separation techniques. Low molecular weight compounds were mixed with polymers where the process viscosity is reduced at process temperatures and mechanical properties are improved once the material system is cooled or reacted. Thermally induced phase separation and thermotropic phase transformation of low molar mass compounds were used in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and poly(ether ether <b>ketone)</b> (PEEK) <b>resins.</b> Reaction induced phase separation was utilized in thermosets to generate anisotropic reinforcements. ^ A new strategy to increase fracture toughness of materials was introduced. Simultaneously, enhancement in stiffness and reduction in process viscosity were also attained. Materials with improved rheological and mechanical properties were prepared by using thermotropic phase transformations of metal soaps in polymers (calcium stearate/iPP). Morphology and thermal properties were studied using WAXS, DSC and SEM. Mechanical and rheological investigation showed significant reduction in process viscosity and substantial improvement in fracture toughness were attained. ^ Effects of molecular architecture of metal soaps were investigated in PEEK (calcium stearate/PEEK and sodium stearate/PEEK). The selected compounds reduced the process viscosity due to the high temperature co-continuous morphology of metal soaps. Unlike the iPP system that incorporates spherical particles, interaction between PEEK and metal soaps resulted in two discrete and co-continuous phases of PEEK and the metal stearates. DMA and melt rheology exhibited that sodium stearate/PEEK composites are stiffer. Effective moduli of secondary metal stearate phase were calculated using different composite theories, which suggested bicontinuous morphology to the metal soaps in PEEK. ^ Use of low molecular weight crystallizable solvents was investigated in reactive systems. Formation of anisotropic reinforcements was evaluated using dimethyl sulfone (DMS) as the crystallizable diluent and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) /m-phenylene diamine (mPDA) material system as the epoxy thermoset. Miscible blends of DMS and DGEBA/mPDA form homogenous mixtures that undergo polymerization induced phase separation, once the DGEBA oligomers react with mPDA. The effect of the competition between the crystallization and phase separation of DMS resulted in nano-wires to micro-scale fiber-like crystals that were generated by adjusting the reaction temperature and DMS concentration. ...|$|R
