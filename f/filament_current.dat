The capacitor C4 provides more protection against feedback, blocking the pulses of RF from the diode, but is usually not needed since the transformers winding T1 normally has enough parasitic capacitance. The audio signal {{is applied to the}} grid of the tube and amplified. The amplified audio signal from the plate passes easily through the low inductance RF primary winding L3 and is applied to the earphones T.

50|$|Thermal Conductivity {{detector}} (TCD), {{this common}} detector {{relies on the}} thermal conductivity of matter passing around a tungsten -rhenium filament with a current traveling through it. In this set up helium or nitrogen serve as the carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament. However, when analyte molecules elute from the column, mixed with carrier gas, the thermal conductivity decreases and this causes a detector response. The response {{is due to the}} decreased thermal conductivity causing an increase in filament temperature and resistivity resulting in fluctuations in voltage. Detector sensitivity is proportional to <b>filament</b> <b>current</b> while it is inversely proportional to the immediate environmental temperature of that detector as well as flow rate of the carrier gas.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to very low gain of about 5 {{and a short}} lifetime of about 30 - 100 hours, the primitive Audion had erratic characteristics because it was incompletely evacuated. De Forest believed that ionization of residual air was key to Audion operation. [...] This made it a more sensitive detector but also caused its electrical characteristics to vary during use. As the tube heated up, gas released from the metal elements would change the pressure in the tube, changing the plate current and other characteristics, so it required periodic bias adjustments to keep it at the correct operating point. Each Audion stage usually had a rheostat to adjust the <b>filament</b> <b>current,</b> and often a potentiometer or multiposition switch to control the plate voltage. The filament rheostat was also used as a volume control. The many controls made multitube Audion receivers complicated to operate.|$|E

5000|$|Incredibly {{similar to}} the MkIII yet still a much {{different}} amplifier is the Valpreaux. It is Goodsell's latest amplifier and just like the MkIII it features a single gain stage, long-tail phase inverter, {{as well as the}} same control surface. What makes the Valpreaux distinct from the MkIII is that it features a significantly larger power transformer which powers a 5 volt GZ34 rectifier tube. Instead of the usual EL84 power tubes, the Valpreaux employs either two or four of the semi-obscure 6973 power tube. These tubes were extensively implemented in amplifiers built by Valco in the 1960's, which leads to the Valpreaux's name being a play upon words, whether intentional or not. Additionally the pre-amp uses four 12AX7 tubes simply because it has enough <b>filament</b> <b>current</b> to afford an extra so the V1 can be paralleled.
