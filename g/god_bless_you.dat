5|$|Vonnegut {{published}} his first novel, Player Piano, in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively, {{but was not}} commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as Cat's Cradle (1963) and <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater (1964). Vonnegut's magnum opus, however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The book's antiwar sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, Slaughterhouse-Five went {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you.</b> Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

Rosewater is a character featured in other books by Kurt Vonnegut, such as <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut based {{the title}} {{character}} of <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a volunteer fire department, and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs. Allen deemed <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater more [...] "a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.|$|E

500|$|Rumfoord, who {{is based}} on Franklin D. Roosevelt, also {{physically}} resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, [...] "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up." [...] William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater and Jailbird.|$|E
500|$|Skelton and Marcel Marceau {{shared a}} long {{friendship}} and admiration of each other's work. [...] Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn {{as the host}} in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three Funny Faces specials that Skelton produced for HBO. [...] In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, [...] "Red, you are eternal for me and {{the millions of people}} you made laugh and cry. [...] May <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> forever, my great and precious companion. [...] I will never forget that silent world we created together." [...] CBS issued the following statement upon his death: [...] "Red's audience had no age limits. [...] He was the consummate family entertainer—a winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer and a dancer." ...|$|E
500|$|Religion {{features}} {{frequently in}} Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced {{a number of}} his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric, and was prone to using such expressions as [...] "God forbid" [...] and [...] "thank God". He once wrote his own version of the Requiem Mass, which he then had translated into Latin and set to music. In <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is euthanized by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including Isaac Asimov, William Shakespeare, and Kilgore Trout—the last a fictional character from several of his novels. Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths, and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in Player Piano, The Sirens of Titan and Cat's Cradle. In The Sirens of Titan, Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. Slaughterhouse-Five sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> all. Thank you so much for having me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E
500|$|Knox did not record when {{or how he}} was {{converted}} to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas {{as a sign of}} his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the reformation and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, [...] "Nay, return to your bairns [...] and <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you.</b> One is sufficient for a sacrifice." [...] Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in Breakfast of Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E

2500|$|Pope John Paul II {{become the}} first pope that visited the Republic of Croatia. This was on September 10, 1994, {{during the period of}} the Croatian War of Independence. On September 11, the Holy Father led the Eucharistic celebration in Zagreb in front of about a million people on the {{occasion}} of the 900th anniversary of the establishment of the Archdiocese of Zagreb. In addition, he officially opened and blessed the building of the Apostolic Nunciature in Zagreb. John Paul visited Croatia two more times; from October 2 to 4, 1998, during which he canonized Cardinal Stepinac at the Eucharistic celebration in the Croatian National shrine of Marija Bistrica, in front of about 500 thousand people, and he later celebrated Mass {{on the occasion of the}} 1700th anniversary of the city of Split; from June 5 to 9, 2003, during which he visited Krk, Rijeka, Zadar, Dubrovnik, Osijek, and Đakovo. He left with words: [...] "I greet you beloved Croatian people! Thank you young Croatians as well. May <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you,</b> Croatian land! <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you!</b> May God continue to bless and protect Croatia! It will always have a privileged place in my love and in my prayers!" [...] Then Pope Benedict XVI visited Zagreb, Croatia, from June 4 to 5, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1988, General Electric, {{which now}} owned NBC through its {{purchase}} of RCA two years earlier, {{announced that it}} would close the NBC Radio division and sell its stations. In February of that year GE made a multi-station deal with Emmis and, in New York City the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. On October 7, 1988 at 5:30 p.m., WFAN moved down the radio dial to replace WNBC at 660kHz. The last voice heard on WNBC was that of Alan Colmes, who said these final words to close the station: [...] "I'm Alan Colmes. Thank you, <b>God</b> <b>bless</b> <b>you,</b> and for the last time, this is 66 WNBC New York City. Let's do the countdown." [...] He then counted down the seconds to WNBC's demise with the legendary NBC chimes (the notes G-E-C) playing in the background.

Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix {{in one hand and}} a rosary in the other and held his arms out in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, [...] "May God have mercy on you!

[...] Before the firing squad were ordered to shoot, Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, [...] "Viva Cristo Rey!"
