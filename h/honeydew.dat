5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called <b>honeydew,</b> when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in <b>honeydew</b> are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the <b>honeydew</b> in {{response}} to ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of <b>honeydew.</b> Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their <b>honeydew.</b> Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|Mature adult ants of {{this species}} mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects are given to their larvae {{collected}} while foraging. However, larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size. Workers will mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the <b>honeydew</b> which is taken to their nest to feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies.|$|E
5|$|Ochetellus ants are omnivores {{that feed}} {{primarily}} on arthropods, but they show {{a preference for}} fluids and sweets when they enter human houses.

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the <b>honeydew</b> it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the <b>honeydew</b> it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E

Pea aphids are not known to be farmed by ants that feed on <b>honeydews.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dysentery is a {{condition}} resulting {{from a combination of}} long periods of inability to make cleansing flights (generally due to cold weather) and food stores which contain a high proportion of indigestible matter. As a bee's gut becomes engorged with feces that cannot be voided in flight as preferred by the bees, the bee voids within the hive. When enough bees do this, the hive population rapidly collapses and death of the colony results. Dark honeys and <b>honeydews</b> have greater quantities of indigestible matter.|$|R

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes <b>honeydew</b> when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as <b>honeydew</b> from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E

40|$|The mutualistic {{relationship}} between ants and plants {{is one of}} the model systems in ecological and evolutionary research. We review the protective ant-plant interaction and its mediation mechanisms. Plants often offer rewards such as food bodies, domatia or <b>honeydews</b> for ants; in return ants protect the host plant from animal herbivory, increase seed production and quality and enhance the competitive dominance of host plants. The protection effect is positive in most cases even though many biotic and abiotic factors vary significantly. The interaction has a broad range of ecological influences, especially on the species richness and abundances of canopy arthropods. Future research should address the origin and maintenance mechanisms of the mutualism, its impacts on partner ants, its relationship with species invasion and its evolutionary ecology significance...|$|R
5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, <b>honeydew,</b> is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds. These are unsightly, reduce the surface area of the plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce {{the value of the}} crop. These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive <b>honeydew.</b> Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or <b>honeydew</b> and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E

40|$|Augmentative {{biocontrol}} {{constitutes a}} safe option to reduce pest populations through {{the enhancement of}} natural enemies’ activity. In this context, the aphidophagous syrphid Episyrphus baltetaus (De Geer) (Diptera: Syrphidae) is a promising candidate for aphid biological control: larvae of this syrphid attack and consume {{a wide range of}} aphid species and are found on many vegetable crops. Because natural populations of beneficial insects are not always sufficient to regulate the pest infestations, this work has focused on the conception of a biological control device containing syrphid eggs which ones can easily be introduced in fields or greenhouses. Using semiochemicals [E-(β) -farnesene, R-(+) -limonene and (Z) - 3 -hexenol], <b>honeydews</b> and “artificial honeydews” (10 % or 30 % aqueous solutions of sucrose, fructose and glucose), the syrphid oviposition was artificially induced on an inert surface. Specifically, E-(β) -farnesene and concentrated mono-sugars (30 %) were identified as the most efficient ovipositional stimulants. To test and validate the biological control device described above, laboratory and field experiments were performed: a plastic lamella covered with syrphid eggs was suspended on aphid infested plants in order to measure the efficiency of the device. The results obtained were promising since populations of 500 aphids were eliminated in ten days when 15 syrphid eggs were introduced. The use of such a biological control device could certainly contribute to the biological control to reduce the aphid infestations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, <b>honeydew,</b> and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E
5|$|In rural Australia, meat ants are {{important}} to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones. However, Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance. Eradication of nests can be difficult, as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected. Particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation; during the early days in Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants, and populations flourished. Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens. Workers also cause problems {{for those who are}} Citrus producers; they will affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce <b>honeydew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and <b>honeydew.</b> They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E
30|$|The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is an {{economically}} important insect pest of citrus that disperses throughout the citrus growing regions, including tropical and subtropical Asia, Middle East, Central America, South America, Mexico, and Brazil (Grafton-Cardwell et al. 2006; Hall et al. 2012). Primarily, it attacks young flushes of citrus {{and can also}} attack the stressed citrus trees, if the population is high (Hussain et al. 2018). Both nymphs and adult psyllid feed directly on phloem of tissues causing the distorted growth of plants as well as shoot dieback. It is also a vector of the phloem-limited bacteria, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and the causal agent of citrus greening disease known as Huanglongbing (HLB) (Halbert et al. 2000; Bové 2006). HLB is the most deadly disease of Citrus spp. (Sapindales: Rutaceae) because the infected trees usually survive for 5 – 8  years with a poor fruit quality in both taste and color (Kamble et al. 2017). Citrus psyllids also excrete <b>honeydews</b> on leaf surface that promotes the sooty mold development and impairs the photosynthetic rate of plants (Reynolds 1999). Husain and Nath (1927) recorded the infestation of ACP in Pakistan’s citrus orchards, and now, {{it has become the}} most destructive and well-established pest to citrus crop in the country (Mahmood et al. 2014). To date, application of synthetic insecticides is one of the tactics being engaged in psyllid management programs (Naeem et al. 2016), but it requires the repeated applications throughout the crop season (Tiwari et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULThe {{olive tree}} (Olea europaea L.) has been shaping and characterizing {{landscape}} {{and culture in}} the Mediterranean basin. This tree is attacked by pest that can cause significant losses. This thesis {{was focused on the}} conservation biological control of one of its most damaging pests: the olive moth, Prays oleae (Bernard). Naturally, a large number of parasitoid and predator species are associated to this pest, and in order to satisfy their needs they make use of ecological infrastructures occurring in the olive grove agroecosystem. However, how these ecological infrastructures can be used to enhance the olive moth conservation biological control needs to be disentangled. For that, two approaches were followed. First, the influence of ecological infrastructures on P. oleae and its natural enemies was analyzed through field surveys. Then, different food resources were evaluated as potential foods for P. oleae and its natural enemies, i. e., the parasitoid Elasmus flabellatus (Fonscolombe) and the predator Chrysoperla carnea s. l. (Stephens). In the first approach, P. oleae was found to disperse throughout non-crop patches, although the implications for the pest population are unknown. The heterogeneous landscapes composed by herbaceous and woody vegetation around the olive groves were exploited by syrphids as food sources. Finally, ground covers within the olive groves favored the parasitoid Ageniaspis fuscicollis (Dalman) while the herbicide application diminished it. In the second approach, insects’ <b>honeydews</b> [Saissetia oleae (Olivier) and Euphyllura olivina (Costa) ] and the flowers of Malva sylvestris L. favored the survival and/ or reproduction of P. oleae, C. carnea and E. flabellatus.

40|$|Membrane-derived {{oligosaccharides}} (MDO) {{consist of}} branched substituted &# 946;-linked sugar chains that {{are present in}} the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. Their common features are the presence of glucose as a major constituent sugar and their increased levels in low-osmolarity media. In several phytopathogenic bacteria, mutants defective in MDO synthesis failed to incite disease on the host plant. Very {{little is known about the}} role of MDO from Salmonella in virulence and osmotolerance. I have studied the structure-function relationship of MDO to understand if they play a role in Salmonella growth and virulence. MDO defective mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium were generated using a gene specific mutagenesis protocol and MDO were isolated and their glycosyl composition analyzed. The fractions containing the major peak from Sephadex G- 10 gel filtration chromatography were pooled and subjected to DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography to separate charged and neutral MDO. Compositional analysis revealed that MDO of wild-type consist of 94 % glucosyl residues (hereafter referred to as glucose) in Salmonella Typhimurium FIRN while MDO of the delta mdoG mutant was comprised of only 24 % glucose. Rhamnose, mannose, and galactose accounted for the rest. We also found that MDO composition varies in different chromosomal backgrounds. For example, glucose accounted for 41 % of sugar residues in MDO of Salmonella Typhimurium SL 1344. This proportion was further reduced to 24 % in the delta mdoG mutant. Salmonella Typhimurium delta mdoG mutants (in FIRN as well as SL 1344 chromosomal backgrounds) displayed reduced virulence in mice. Salmonella Typhimurium SL 1344 delta mdoG mutant strain was recovered from the intestinal tissues and systemic tissues at a lower frequency than its parental wild-type strain and displayed a reduced ability of intracellular replication in macrophages. This defect in the delta mdoG mutant could be associated with the altered MDO composition. The delta mdoG mutant also invaded macrophages at a reduced efficiency and showed lower respiration rate under conditions mimicking acidic environments, such as stomach and phagosomes (pH 5. 0). Correspondingly ATP level in the delta mdoG mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type. These results support an important role for MDO in the virulence of S. Typhimurium. In competition assays using a mouse host, the delta mdoG mutant had a reduced capacity to colonize the mouse tissues. On the contrary, competitive assays on laboratory media showed that the mdoG mutation enhanced the growth of bacteria. A mixed pictured emerged when competition assays were performed by artificially inoculating fresh-cut produce. On tomato and cucumber, the wild-type cells emerged as dominant population after 3 days of growth, while no one strain dominated during the growth on <b>honeydews,</b> cantaloupes, watermelons, as well as acidic fruits such as apples. Together, these data demonstrate that specific wild-type MDO are required for efficient colonization and optimal virulence in mice. For environmental survival under different niches, no evidence was found for a specific need for MDO with particular sugar composition. Enteric pathogens with altered MDO (and reduced virulence) may serve as better "live vaccines"...|$|R

5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on <b>honeydew</b> produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as <b>honeydew,</b> for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant is a diurnal {{species that}} is active {{throughout}} the day, quickly foraging {{on either the}} ground or vegetation. They are scavengers, predators and seed-eaters, generally having a broad diet of animal material, insects, small arthropods, <b>honeydew</b> from sap-sucking insects and seeds. The workers usually prey on beetles, moths and termites, using their stingers to kill them by injecting venom. The removal of the capitula (structure similar to an elaiosome) from Eurycnema goliath eggs reduces the chances of them being collected by green-head ants that carry them back into their nests. In areas where the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) is dominant, the green-head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are primitive general predators, {{in contrast to the}} more advanced species (which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones), they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They rely heavily on any food source, and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants.|$|E
5|$|A diurnal species (active mainly {{during the}} day), the meat ant shows minimal {{interaction}} with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant {{and other members}} of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on <b>honeydew</b> secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success with honey baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate.|$|E
