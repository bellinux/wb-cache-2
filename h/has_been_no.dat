In October 2007, Setanta bought the original strips, which they featured on their web site.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{immigrants}} were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation {{such as the}} Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European goldfinch, house sparrow, starlings and blackbirds are common. Introduced bees and European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E

[...] Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements [...] "there would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> Khomeinism ideology.

5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what has been the case historically. Since November 4, 2015, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with a partisan affiliation.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> serious {{accident}} in the immediate area around Victoria station. On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloak-room of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, {{as part of the}} Fenian dynamite campaign. On 27 August 1910, an empty LB stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries. On 17 July 1946, a light engine collided with a passenger train; several people were injured. On 15 December 1959, a passenger train collided with a rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured.|$|E

5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Arab {{countries}} politically supported China in the OIC with especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt helping China squash {{any potential}} anti-Chinese motion by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on the Uyghurs, Egypt viewed {{its own internal}} sectarian problems like China's and Sudan was also concerned about external interference in its internal problems as well, while Indonesia {{had to deal with}} its own internal Islamists and emphasized that there was no religious conflict but instead ethnic based disturbances in Xinjiang to calm the situation down. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> public reaction by the Arab League, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|Being {{a pilgrimage}} town, the {{majority}} of the population is involved in tourism related industry consisting of trade and services. Service sector increased from 70% in 1971 to 98.78% in 2001, while the agricultural sector reduced from 23% in 1971 to 0.13% in 2001. Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> demarcation for industrial land due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography. Being an island town, the traditional occupation was fishing, but due to poor returns, the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions. Banks such as State Bank of India, Indian Bank and RDCC Bank have their branches in Rameswaram.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found that there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> evidence of wrongdoing, {{it was felt that}} any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
