5|$|Stepfamilies are {{becoming}} more <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> America. Divorce rates are rising and the remarriage rate is rising as well, therefore, bringing two families together making step families. Statistics show that there are 1,300 new stepfamilies forming every day. Over half of American families are remarried, that is 75% of marriages ending in divorce, remarry.|$|E
5|$|Each of the 19 {{months is}} given a name which is an {{attribute}} of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty). The Bahá'í week is <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> that it consists of seven days, with {{each day of the}} week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries {{in the history of the}} religion.|$|E
5|$|Hun is <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> 8th and 9th century England, for {{instance}} {{as part of}} a name with two elements. During the 9th century there were East Anglian bishops of Helmham named Ælfhun, Hunferthus and Hunbeorht and a bishop of Worcester called Æthelhun. Hun also occurred {{as part of a}} moneyer's name. There are several placenames in England that contain the term as a personal name element, such as Hunsdon, Hertfordshire and Hunston, West Sussex (but not Hunston, Suffolk). It is possible that Hun was a historical figure, whose name was run together with Beonna's by a scribe.|$|E

5|$|Ironclads were {{designed}} for several roles, including as high seas battleships, coastal defense ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century. This change was pushed forward {{by the development of}} heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to be shown in {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E
5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E

5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{street gangs}} {{operate in the}} Bay Area, {{including}} the Sureños and Norteños in San Francisco's Mission District. African-American street gangs <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> other cities, including the Crips, have struggled to establish footholds in the city, although gangs with shotcallers in China, including Triad {{groups such as the}} Wo Hop To, have been reported active. In 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two Chinese gangs led to a shooting attack at the Golden Dragon restaurant in Chinatown, which left five people dead and eleven wounded. Five members of the Joe Boys gang were arrested and convicted of the crime. Oakland, which also sees organized gang violence, implemented Operation Ceasefire in 2012 in an effort to reduce the violence.|$|E

40|$|In {{this present}} study, we explore two {{conditions}} under which monolingual Englishspeaking toddlers (N= 12) may learn and retain knowledge of names of <b>familiar</b> objects <b>in</b> a second language. We examined toddlers' ability to learn names of <b>familiar</b> objects <b>in</b> a foreign language given limited exposure (total of 30 minutes). Second, we considered the role of learning schedules on the participants' ability to learn <b>familiar</b> nouns <b>in</b> a foreign language. Specifically, we examined whether toddlers were better able to learn a foreign language object label if they were exposed to Spanish for five (6 minutes) massed sessions (over {{the course of one}} week) as opposed to five distributed sessions which were spread apart (over the course of several weeks). Overall, children were able to learn and retain knowledge of six names of <b>familiar</b> objects <b>in</b> Spanish, regardless of learning schedule condition. However, toddlers who were assigned massed learning schedule condition were better able to learn and retain knowledge of labels of <b>familiar</b> objects <b>in</b> a second language, even after a week of second language exposure.

5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> the change of {{apparent}} pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long <b>familiar</b> <b>in</b> English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E

It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely <b>familiar.</b> <b>In</b> fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
