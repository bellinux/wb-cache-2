However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E

The present investigation was designed to examine tooth mortality and the patterns of tooth loss in khat chewer and non- khat chewer in a selected population in Sana’a-Yemen. A total of 2506 individuals, 1216 males and 1290 females ranging in age from 15 to 64 years were examined. The status of every present permanent tooth was assessed. Individuals who chewed one or two times a week for five years were considered as khat chewer. Individuals with no khat chewing history or chewed less than 5 times in their lifetimes were considered as non-chewer. Female khat chewers had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>teeth</b> loss compared to other sub-groups, irrespective of whether they chewed khat or not.

40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to to analyze the effect of Type 2 {{diabetes}} on tooth mortality, implant treatment and prosthetic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 275 Type 2 diabetics and 300 non-diabetics, aged 40 - 80 years were selected for analysis. The assessment of number of teeth, missing teeth, fixed prostheses (bridge pontics), implants using panoramic radiographs and dental records were carried out. RESULTS. Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients had a higher number of missing teeth (P<. 05) and placed implants (P=. 074), age (P<. 05), male gender percentage (P=. 042), smoker percentage (P<. 05) than non-DM patients. In univariate analysis, the patients in older group showed significantly <b>higher</b> number of <b>tooth</b> loss rate at the first dental examination than the patients in younger group.

These determinations were {{made on the basis}} of comparisons with a sample of the South American gondwanathere Sudamerica ameghinoi, in which all eight molariform positions are known. However, the large number of mf4s led Wilson and colleagues to suspect that the criteria used for distinguishing Sudamerica tooth positions may not apply directly to Bharattherium. Prasad and colleagues did not assign their two Bharattherium teeth to any tooth position, but suggested that they may represent different tooth positions and that one may come from the upper and the other from the lower side of the jaw. As is characteristic of sudamericids, Bharattherium molariforms are hypsodont (high-crowned) and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface atop a <b>high</b> <b>tooth,</b> with furrows that extend down the height of the tooth.

Other researchers, however, had already stated that the quarry, which Zhuchengosaurus also shows, was not sufficient to distinguish. In the older kind of Shantungosaurus the coalescence of extra vertebrae in the sacrum was a common effect of aging.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Currently, New Guinea Stegonotus with 17 scales at midbody {{and divided}} subcaudals are {{identified}} as S. modestus. But this will {{not account for the}} disparity in dentition within "S. modestus", nor the colour differences even at one locality, nor that in East and West Sepik Districts there are three quite distinct "S. modestus": (1) a large form with high ventral count and <b>high</b> <b>tooth</b> count; (2) a small form with low ventral count but <b>high</b> <b>tooth</b> count; and (3) a medium-sized form with high ventral count but low tooth count (fig. 1). The material in the British Museum and American Museum of Natural History indicates that scale count does not correctly identify the species, and that such features as dentition, form of the palatine bone, scale pits, size, and coloration are more reliable. GENERAL FEATURES OF NEW GUINEA STEGONOTUS New Guinea Stegonotus are very closely related to the Oriental genus Dinodon; the supposed dental differences between these genera do not hold and the maxillary dentition of (for example) Stegonotus diehli more closely resembles that of Dinodon orientale than it does that of Stegonotus cucullatus. I find only one character that will separate New Guinea Stegonotus from Dinodon: in Dinodon, the membranous dorsal wall of the trachea is expanded as a large and simple sac continuous with the lung 1); but in all New Guinea Stegonotus, dorsal tracheal perforations lead into a series of separate membranous sacs, as described by Brongersma (1957). Stegonotus and Dinodon show a general similarity in form and a sexual dimorphism in ventral count with males exceeding females (the reverse of the usual dimorphism).

40|$|Abstract Background Specialised leaf-eating {{is almost}} universally {{regarded}} as the ancestral state of all ruminants, yet little evidence can be cited {{in support of this}} assumption, apart from the fact that all early ruminants had low crowned cheek teeth. Instead, recent years have seen the emergence evidence contradicting the conventional view that low tooth crowns always indicate leaf-eating and <b>high</b> <b>tooth</b> crowns grass-eating. Results Here we report the results of two independent palaeodietary reconstructions for one of the earliest deer, Procervulus ginsburgi from the Early Miocene of Spain, suggesting that despite having lower tooth crowns than any living ruminant, this species included a significant proportion of grass in its diet. Conclusion The phylogenetic distribution of feeding styles strongly supports that leaf-grass mixed feeding was the original feeding style of deer, and that later dietary specialization on leaves or grass occurred independently in several lineages. Evidence for other ruminant clades suggests that facultative mixed feeding may in fact have been the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia, which would have been morphologically expressed only under specific environmental factors. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The work {{described}} {{here has been}} carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} tooth root cracking failure mode of timing belts. Previous work has demonstrated the close dependence of this on the tooth deflections of fully meshed teeth, generated by torque transmission, but has not considered the additional distortions generated in the partially meshed conditions at entry to and exit from a pulley groove. Approximate compatibility and constitutive equations are combined with a rigorous consideration of tooth equilibrium in partial meshing to show how bending moments are generated at both exit from a driven pulley and entry to a driving pulley. Experimentally determined belt lives correlate very well with a combined measure of fully meshed tooth strain and strain due to bending at entry or exit. The analysis also shows that this strain measure reduces with increasing belt tooth stiffness, confirming the importance of a <b>high</b> <b>tooth</b> stiffness for a long belt life. Tooth force variations through the partial meshing cycle have also been predicted and compared with measurements obtained from a special strain gauge instrumented pulley.

All participants filled out a simple questionnaire that included 19 questions on not only their eating habits, but also their oral hygiene. All respondents were assigned a KPE index value, which quantifies tooth decay, according to their health records. All data was processed, compared and analyzed in Microsoft Excel, 2007. The results show that respondents who consume sweets one time and more per day show <b>higher</b> <b>tooth</b> decay (KPE 16. 58) than those who consume sweets less than one time per day (KPE 9. 41). A similar situation exists for the consumption of soft drinks, where drinking at least one per day is associated with a significantly higher average of KPE (16. 30) than in people who indulge less in sweetened beverages (KPE 12. 87). Respondents who did not sweeten their coffee, tea or other beverages and foods are much less affected by cavities (KPE 11. 07) than those who sweeten them only sometimes or all the time (KPE 16. 27).

40|$|Aim: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature and to determine the clinical performance of conservative surgery (CS) {{for the treatment of}} intrabony defects (ID). Methods: RCTs on ID treatment with 12 months of follow-up were identified through electronic databases and hand-searched journals. Primary outcomes were tooth survival, clinical attachment (CAL) gain, probing depth (PD) reduction and gingival recession increase (REC). Weighted means and forest plots were calculated for each outcome variable 12 months after surgery. Long-term stability was explored with RCTs of at least 24 months of follow-up. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the type of flap. Results: Twenty-seven trials reporting 647 subjects and 734 defects were identified. Twelve months after CS, tooth survival was 98 % (IQ: 96. 77 - 100), CAL gain 1. 65 mm (95 % CI: 1. 37 - 1. 94; p < 0. 0001), PD reduction 2. 80 mm (CI: 2. 43 - 3. 18; p < 0. 0001) and REC increase 1. 26 mm (CI: 0. 94 - 1. 49; p < 0. 0001). Longer follow-up showed similar findings. CI of CAL gain were 1. 44 - 3. 52 for recently introduced papilla preservation flaps and 1. 25 - 1. 89 mm for access flaps.

40|$|Horses {{achieve a}} higher degree of {{particle}} size reduction through ingestive mastication than functional ruminants. We characterized mastication using chew-monitoring halters (RumiWatch) in six domestic horses, cattle, and Bactrian camels each. All animals were offered grass hay of the same batch for 15 min. In cattle and camels, measurements were continued after eating until rumination was observed. Except for one horse, 96 % of the horses’ ingestive mastication data were identified as “rumination” by the proprietary RumiWatch algorithm, whereas ingestion and rumination by cattle and camels were mostly classified correctly. There were no systematic differences between cattle and camels. In cattle and camels, ingestive mastication was less regular than rumination, indicated by significantly higher standard deviations of chewing peak intervals, peak heights, and peak breadths in intraindividual comparisons. The average standard deviations of these measures were lower in horses than in cattle and camel ingestive mastication, indicating a more consistent chewing pattern in horses. Horse values were similar to those of rumination mastication, suggesting equally regular chewing motions. Regular, rhythmic chewing represents a common feature of horses and functional ruminants, but the less uniform ingestive mastication in functional ruminants represents a deviating pattern, the adaptive value of which remains unclear. In particular, it does not appear to promote a higher ingestion rate. A potential cause may be the avoidance of <b>high</b> <b>tooth</b> wear rates by delaying a more regular, systematic mastication until ingesta has been softened and the grit has been washed off in the forestomach...|$|E
40|$|New local/regional {{climatic data}} were {{compared}} with floral and faunal records from central Patagonia to investigate how faunas evolve {{in the context of}} local and global climates. Oxygen isotope compositions of mammal fossils between c. 43 and 21 Ma suggest a nearly constant mean annual temperature of 16 ± 3 °C, consistent with leaf physiognomic and sea surface studies that imply temperatures of 16 – 18 °C. Carbon isotopes in tooth enamel track atmospheric δ 13 C, but with a positive deviation at 27. 2 Ma, and a strong negative deviation at 21 Ma. Combined with paleosol characteristics and reconstructed Leaf Area Indices (rLAIs), these trends suggest aridification from 45 Ma (c. 1200 mm/yr) to 43 Ma (c. 450 mm/yr), quasi-constant MAP until at least 31 Ma, and an increase to ~ 800 mm/yr by 21 Ma. Comparable MAP through most of the sequence is consistent with relatively constant floral compositions, rLAI, and leaf physiognomy. Abundance of palms reflects relatively dry-adapted lineages and greater drought tolerance under higher pCO 2. Pedogenic carbonate isotopes imply low pCO 2 = 430 ± 300 ppmv at the initiation of the Eocene–Oligocene climatic transition. Arid conditions in Patagonia during the late Eocene through Oligocene provided dust to the Southern Ocean, enhancing productivity of silicifiers, drawdown of atmospheric CO 2, and protracted global cooling.
