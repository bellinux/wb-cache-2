40|$|Future {{manufacturing}} systems need to {{cope with}} frequent changes and disturbances. As such, their control requires constant adaptation and high flexibility. Holonic manufacturing is a highly distributed control paradigm that promises to handle these problems successfully. It {{is based on the}} concept of autonomous co-operating agents, called ‘holons’. This paper gives an overview of the holonic reference architecture for manufacturing systems as developed at PMA-KULeuven. This architecture, called PROSA, consists of three types of basic holons: order <b>holons,</b> product <b>holons,</b> and resource <b>holons.</b> They are structured using the object-oriented concepts of aggregation and specialisation. Staff <b>holons</b> can be added to assist the basic <b>holons</b> with expert knowledge. The resulting architecture has a high degree of self-similarity, which reduces the complexity to integrate new components and enables easy reconfiguration of the system. PROSA shows to cover aspects of both hierarchical as well as heterarchical control approaches. As such, it can be regarded as a generalisation of the two former approaches. More importantly, PROSA introduces significant innovations: the system structure is decoupled from the control algorithm, logistical aspects can be decoupled from technical ones, and PROSA opens opportunities to achieve mor...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Holons</b> are the {{individual}} {{building blocks of}} Wilber's model. Wilber borrowed the concept of <b>holons</b> from Arthur Koestler's description of the great chain of being, a mediaeval description of levels of being. [...] "Holon" [...] means that every entity and concept is both an entity on its own, and a hierarchical {{part of a larger}} whole. For example, a cell in an organism is both a whole as a cell, {{and at the same time}} a part of another whole, the organism. Likewise a letter is a self-existing entity and simultaneously an integral part of a word, which then is part of a sentence, which is part of a paragraph, which is part of a page; and so on. Everything from quarks to matter to energy to ideas can be looked at in this way. The relation between individuals and society is not the same as between cells and organisms though, because individual <b>holons</b> can be members but not parts of social <b>holons.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} the normal-state {{transport}} in the cuprate superconductors can {{be understood in terms}} of a two-fluid model of spinons and <b>holons.</b> In our scenario, the resistivity is determined by the properties of the <b>holons</b> while magnetotransport involves the recombination of <b>holons</b> and spinons to form physical electrons.

This agrees with our analysis of the normal-state data. We predict a strong increase in linewidth with increasing temperature in photoemission.

The cooperation mechanisms among <b>holons</b> are established based on the pricing concept of market economy following `Lagrangian relaxation' of mathematical optimization, and cooperation across cells is performed without accessing individual cells' local information nor intruding on their decision authority. The system also possesses structural recursivity and extendibility. Numerical testing shows that the method can generate near-optimal schedules with quantifiable quality in a timely fashion, and has comparable computational requirements and performance as compared to the centralized method following single-level Lagrangian relaxation. The method thus provides a theoretical foundation for guiding the cooperation among <b>holons,</b> leading to globally near-optimal performance...|$|R

40|$|A Holonic Manufacturing System (HMS) is a {{manufacturing}} system where key elements, such as machines, products, parts, etc., have autonomous and cooperative properties.

40|$|AbstractWith the high-Tc cuprates in mind, {{properties}} of correlated d-wave superconducting (SC) states are studied for a Hubbard model on square lattices with a diagonal transfer (t-t’-U model), using a variational Monte Carlo method.

We first {{check that the}} range of dominant superconductivity {{is limited to a}} strongly correlated regime (U>W, U: onsite correlation strength, W: band width), and coincides with the effective range of the D-H binding factors. In this range of U/t and δ (doping rate), <b>holons</b> (in hole-doped cases) are classified into two types: doped <b>holons</b> and ones created as D-H pairs. Only the former <b>holons</b> participate in current, whereas the latter contribute to singlet-pair formation. Next, we show that the SC properties undergo a crossover at U=Uco∼W.
