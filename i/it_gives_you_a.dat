5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lot of freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy {{the movement of the}} body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|... "You can't fake {{that amount}} of heat", Mackie says, adding, [...] "When you are on set {{and all of the}} extras are Iraqi refugees, it really informs the movie that you're making. When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective... of people who were {{actually}} there, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and the story you would like to tell. It was a great experience to be there." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Rihanna spoke of how [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] {{was one of her}} favorite songs on the album, saying [...] "I love that song [...] That {{is one of my favorite}} songs on the album. It makes you feel like celebrating... <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> great feeling inside, like you want to go out and have a drink... People can't wait for the weekend." [...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' is one of my favorite songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{made his}} fastest opening to {{a season in}} 2001 by winning the 100m for his club Belgrave Harriers at the European Clubs Cup with a meet record time of 10.12s. At the Amateur Athletics Association (AAA) trials in Birmingham his run of 10.01s was the fastest ever wind-legal time {{recorded}} in Britain by a British sprinter. Chambers ran with consistency {{in the summer of}} 2001: he won at the Seville Grand Prix in 10.01s and finished third in ten seconds flat at the Athletissima meet. In the run up to the 2001 IAAF Edmonton World Championships Chambers compared his own performances to the British record holder: [...] "I am very consistent in the 10.00s this year, and that bodes well for the Worlds. If you are running as fast as Linford Christie in his prime, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lot of confidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well, well. Try the antidote,’ rejoined Mr. Crisparkle; ‘and may <b>it</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{brighter}} and {{better view of}} the case! We will discuss it no more now. I have to thank you for myself, thank you sincerely.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|TransApps {{became part}} of a larger effort by the NIST to {{instantiate}} app testing guidelines within a secure environment. As Tom Karygiannis noted, the NIST produced voluntary guidelines for the government on how to “vet and test mobile apps before you deploy them. <b>It</b> doesn't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> go or no-go or red light, green light type of thing, but <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of what you should test for. Then, in turn, you would need your own security analyst to decide in your environment whether that's acceptable or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think you've {{grown more}} {{pleasing}} {{to look upon}} than you ever were,' she said. 'I don't {{know what it is}} that has come over you of late, but there's a depth in your eyes that is quite new. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> odd mysteriousness which is very attractive.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Lewis later recalled, [...] "There is no {{game like}} {{football}}. ... If it hadn't been for football {{there is no}} telling what I would be today. ... <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> general hardening and training which stands a man in good use in later life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Upvenue, Tobin Esperance said of Time for Annihilation that [...] "We put out five major label, full-length records, and we were transitioning from a major label, going independent, {{and we wanted to}} do something different [...] we'd always talked about doing a live record, and it turned into 'let's add a couple of bonus songs' [...] and now it's half live, half new songs and it's kind of the past and present of Papa Roach, and I think it's a good representation and a good reminder of what this band's about, [...] and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> look at where our sound can go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how your boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. All that's rot, of course. Sometimes I don't {{know how}} I'm {{going to live}} up to the good opinion Harry has of me. But when you've done so much for a pal as I have for him <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> awful sense of {{responsibility}} towards him.|$|R
6000|$|Jessie nodded. [...] "It's romantic, {{and though}} {{you must be}} glad it's over, {{there must be some}} {{satisfaction}} in feeling that you owe the change to your own efforts. Doesn't <b>it</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> feeling that in some degree you're master of your fate? I fancy I should like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> rather {{pleasing}} sensation {{to think}} of people you didn't know and had never seen receiving emotions, subtle and passionate, {{from the work of}} your hands? Everyone likes power. I can't imagine a more wonderful exercise of it than to move the souls of men to pity or terror." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Nonsense! That's the {{way every}} woman feels when she's laced. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} waist, Roberts! Ah, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! O Lord! Oh, mercy! Ah, ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I always say," [...] {{reflected}} Captain Nichols, [...] "when {{you hurt}} a man, hurt him bad. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{bit of time}} to look about and think what you'll do next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mrs. Holland," [...] he said. [...] "You {{have done}} quite right {{to come on}} board early. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance of being {{attended}} to, before the stewards are being called for by twenty people at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, how did my {{calculations}} {{come out}} under these circumstances? When I calculated that this impetuous young woman would overdo {{it in new}} directions, was I wrong or right? I was right. What does she try to do? Don't let <b>it</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> turn? To throw the murder on her ladyship." ...|$|R
5000|$|The work won Husa the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Music. The award brought {{international}} attention to Czech-born composer, who favorably recalled, [...] "You {{have the confidence}} {{that what you are}} doing is somehow rewarded. That's a terrific feeling, of course. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> incredible lift, and keeps <b>you</b> in <b>a</b> mood so that you can compose more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you know}} nothing about her, careless, and would hold her up to public scorn if <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> minute's amusement.

6000|$|... "Will it have Omnes Omnibus for its representative?" [...] Le Chapelier was laughing, his countenance eager. [...] "Ancenis will be convulsed with pride.

6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to hear}} it, my man, for <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{chance of}} coming in contact with better men than smugglers--although I'm free to confess {{that there is some}} good among them too.

6000|$|... "O yes; I know; {{after having}} {{lived in the}} same house with a kitchen poker for four years, you get so {{attached}} to it that <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> pang to part with it. No, but the comparison is no compliment to the poker; that is firm enough, at any rate,--a down cushion would be better." ...|$|E

60|$|LOMAX [coming forward between Sarah and Undershaft] You'll find it awfully interesting. I've {{been through}} the Woolwich Arsenal; and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> ripping feeling of security, you know, {{to think of the}} lot of beggars we could kill if it came to fighting. [To Undershaft, with sudden solemnity] Still, it must be rather an awful {{reflection}} for you, from the religious point of view as it were. You're getting on, you know, and all that.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing but}} what's bearable {{as long as}} a man can work," [...] he said to himself; [...] "the natur o' things doesn't change, though it seems as if one's own life was nothing but change. The square o' four is sixteen, and you must {{lengthen}} your lever in proportion to your weight, is as true when a man's miserable as when he's happy; and the best o' working is, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> grip hold o' things outside your own lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine, don't you know, A lemon-coloured contrivance. Rather {{bright and}} so forth, {{but in its}} proper place not {{altogether}} a bad egg.

6000|$|... "It's romantic; and, though you're glad it's over, {{there must}} be some {{satisfaction}} in feeling that you owe the change to your own efforts.
