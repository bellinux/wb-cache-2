5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van <b>Dam</b> in a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van <b>Dam,</b> he attempted to hit Van <b>Dam</b> with a flying clothesline. However, Van <b>Dam</b> {{moved out of the}} way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van <b>Dam</b> performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, Van <b>Dam</b> attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van <b>Dam</b> then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van <b>Dam</b> in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van <b>Dam</b> for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|On the July 3 {{episode of}} Raw, a triple threat match was booked between Rob Van <b>Dam,</b> Edge, and John Cena for the WWE title, after Van <b>Dam</b> made the stipulation. Edge, {{as part of}} scripted events, {{defeated}} both Van <b>Dam</b> and Cena to become the new WWE champion, after pinning Van <b>Dam.</b> The following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Van <b>Dam</b> lost the ECW title to The Big Show, after the Big Show received assistance from Paul Heyman, who declined to make the three-count for Van <b>Dam,</b> but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show. Later on WWE's official website, {{it was announced that}} Heyman suspended Van <b>Dam</b> for 30 days without giving a reason. This angle was written after WWE suspended Van <b>Dam</b> for his recent drug possession arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Pensacola <b>Dam,</b> {{also known}} as the Grand River <b>Dam,</b> is a multiple-arch {{buttress}} <b>dam</b> on the Grand River in-between Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The <b>dam</b> is operated by the Grand River <b>Dam</b> Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first hydroelectric power plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch <b>dam</b> in the world.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} efficiency, all-wood timber check <b>dams</b> are the most expensive, whereas concrete check <b>dams</b> are the cheapest, with all-wood timber check <b>dams</b> being expensive at 241  % {{of the cost of}} concrete check <b>dams.</b> However, it is possible to reduce the cost of all-wood timber check <b>dams</b> to around 60  % of its current level by changing the construction method and materials. Hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> are 132  % of the costs of concrete check <b>dams,</b> and slightly less expensive than steel check <b>dams,</b> and can therefore be competitive with them in terms of cost.|$|R
40|$|Lactation is an {{important}} function that is dependent on changes in the maternal homeostasis and sustained by histological maternal adjustments. We evaluated how offspring manipulations during the lactational phase can modulate maternal morphologic aspects in the mammary gland, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets of lactating <b>dams.</b> Two different models of litter-manipulation-during-lactation were used: litter sizes, small litters (SL) or normal litters (NL) and subcutaneous injections in the puppies of monosodium glutamate (MSG), or saline (CON). SL <b>Dams</b> and MSG <b>Dams</b> presented an increase in WAT content and higher plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, and insulin, in relation to NL <b>Dams</b> and CON <b>Dams,</b> respectively. The MG of SL <b>Dams</b> and MSG <b>Dams</b> presented a high adipocyte content and reduced alveoli development and the milk of the SL <b>Dams</b> presented a higher calorie and triglyceride content, {{compared to that of}} the NL <b>Dams.</b> SL <b>Dams</b> presented a reduction in islet size and greater lipid droplet accumulation in BAT, in relation to NL <b>Dams.</b> SL <b>Dams</b> and MSG <b>Dams</b> present similar responses to offspring manipulation during lactation, resulting in changes in metabolic parameters. These alterations were associated with higher fat accumulation in BAT and changes in milk composition only in SL <b>Dams...</b>|$|R
25|$|Embankment <b>dams</b> {{are made}} from {{compacted}} earth, and have two main types, rock-fill and earth-fill <b>dams.</b> Embankment <b>dams</b> rely on their weight {{to hold back the}} force of water, like gravity <b>dams</b> made from concrete.|$|R

50|$|Diversion <b>dams</b> are one {{of three}} classifications of <b>dams</b> which include: storage <b>dams,</b> {{detention}} <b>dams,</b> and diversion <b>dams.</b> Storage <b>dams</b> are used to store water for extended lengths of time. The stored water then {{can be used for}} irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. Detention <b>dams</b> are built to catch surface runoff to prevent floods and trap sediment by regulating the flow rate of the runoff into channels downstream. Diversion <b>dams</b> are used to raise the water level in order to redirect the water to the designated location. The diverted water can be used for supplying irrigation systems or reservoirs.|$|R

5|$|Two {{additional}} dams {{were built}} on the Cotter: the Bendora <b>Dam,</b> a double-curvature, concrete-arch structure, was completed in 1961; and the Corin <b>Dam,</b> an earth and rock-fill embankment <b>dam,</b> was built in 1968. In 1979 Googong <b>Dam</b> was {{built on the}} Queanbeyan River in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>dam</b> {{across the}} Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a <b>dam</b> capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the <b>dam</b> {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 the <b>dams,</b> and all {{the assets}} of Crown Zellerbach, were {{acquired}} by the James River Corporation, which owned the <b>dams</b> until 2000. Concerned that it might someday be required to remove the <b>dams</b> and pay for river restoration, the corporation, sought to transfer the <b>dams</b> to the federal government. In February 2000, the government bought the <b>dams</b> and related facilities for $29.5 million. Until removal, the <b>dams</b> had been operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, with National Park Service oversight. When the federal government purchased the <b>dams</b> in 2000, it freed the James River Corporation from any further liability related to {{the damage caused by}} the <b>dams</b> in the past or potentially in the future.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{recreation}} activities occur {{in and around}} the <b>dam</b> and catchment area. Canning <b>Dam</b> features a number of picnic areas (with gas barbecues), look outs and historic walks – many with disabled access. Bushwalking occurs throughout the catchment, particularly along the Bibbulmun Track, which passes through the catchment about 10km upstream of Canning <b>Dam.</b> Several mountain bike trails run either through the Canning National Park or adjacent State Forest areas.|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the <b>dam</b> altogether. In the meantime, construction on the <b>dam</b> continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones <b>Dam.</b> As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the <b>dam</b> was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn <b>Dam</b> was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the <b>dam</b> would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom <b>Dam,</b> and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a <b>dam</b> as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn <b>Dam</b> would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

30|$|We {{calculated}} {{the life cycle}} CO 2 emissions and direct installation costs for two types of timber check <b>dams</b> (all-wood timber and hybrid timber) developed in Akita Prefecture and non-timber check <b>dams</b> (concrete and steel). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of timber check <b>dams</b> in reducing CO 2 emissions and their economic efficiency compared with non-timber check <b>dams.</b> We found that switching from concrete to all-wood timber and hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> reduced CO 2 emissions by 54 and 43  %, respectively. Switching from steel to all-wood timber and hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> reduced CO 2 emissions by 28 and 11  %, respectively. In terms of direct installation costs, all-wood timber check <b>dams</b> were 241  % that of concrete check <b>dams</b> and 179  % that of steel check <b>dams,</b> but hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> were only 132 and 98  %, confirming {{that they could be}} competitive in terms of price. From the perspective of reducing CO 2 emissions costs, we found that a policy for switching from concrete to all-wood or hybrid timber check <b>dams</b> did not constitute a low-cost means of reducing CO 2 emissions, compared with other policies for reducing CO 2 emissions.|$|R
