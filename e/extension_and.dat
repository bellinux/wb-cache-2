5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, the German-Jewish {{community}} had mostly {{moved from the}} Lower East Side. In 1889, Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim moved to 216 East 15th Street, near Second Avenue, selling the Rivington Street building to the New York City Church <b>Extension</b> <b>and</b> Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which built or purchased churches, missions, and Sunday schools in New York City.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim {{purchased}} the Rivington Street building from the Church <b>Extension</b> <b>and</b> Missionary Society {{to satisfy a}} need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church <b>Extension</b> <b>and</b> Missionary Society.|$|E
