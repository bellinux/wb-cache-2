5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke in the past.

5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit {{a large proportion of}} maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
