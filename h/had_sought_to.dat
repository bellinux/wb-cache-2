5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{accession}} of Tiberius, Drusus {{had been}} systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in Illyricum in AD 18, and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in AD 21. In practice {{it was still}} Sejanus who was the second man in the empire and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as AD 20, Sejanus <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> solidify his connection with the imperial family, by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented, when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government {{was not prepared to}} concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E

Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned, but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties. After the cessation of hostilities with France {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824, the Glastonbury Canal in 1827, and the Chard Canal in 1834.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was officially}} Drusus {{who was the}} heir to Tiberius, in practice, it was the Praetorian prefect Sejanus who was the second man in the empire.

5|$|From 1921, {{the country}} had {{negotiated}} the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia {{in the face of}} Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the arrangements in 1933. This had been followed the following year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these arrangements in place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti-Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened on that front until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its bilateral relationship with Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{although}} the French Navy <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> oppose the Royal Navy at sea from their main base at Brest in Brittany, the Royal Navy had achieved victories at the Glorious First of June and Battle of Groix. The losses inflicted on the French Atlantic fleet in these battles were compounded by large numbers of ships wrecked in storms during the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver and Expédition d'Irlande operations. By 1798 the Royal Navy was unopposed in its control of the Atlantic, enforcing its supremacy by a strategy of close blockade, maintaining a battle fleet at sea off Brittany and an inshore squadron of frigates watching the approaches to Brest. In June 1798 the inshore squadron included a detachment comprising the 38-gun HMS Jason under Captain Charles Stirling, the 36-gun HMS Pique under Captain David Milne and 32-gun HMS Mermaid under Captain James Newman-Newman.|$|E

5|$|On 26 April 2007, Norway {{signed a}} NOK150 million joint-development {{agreement}} with Saab {{to cooperate in}} the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries {{in the development of}} future versions of the aircraft. In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with Thales Norway A/S concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter. This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with cooperation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E
5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard <b>had</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E
