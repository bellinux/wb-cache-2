40|$|Total {{ozone data}} {{obtained}} during summers at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, with Dobson Spectrophotometer 83 are routinely compared with overpass total ozone {{data from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) spectrometer launched aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in 1978. Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). Dobson spectrophotometer 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. <b>Dobson</b> instrument <b>station</b> <b>network</b> in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the Standard Dobson Spectrophotometer for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with Dobson spectrophotometer 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder. (The SBUV- 2 S/N- 2 instrument, built by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA- 13 satellite). We present results of the comparisons which include ozone vertical distribution data obtained with a balloon-borne electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde (Komhyr, 1969) ...|$|R

The SBUV measurements are found to drift against the <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> with a linear trend of. 38 + or -. 13 percent/yr. The cause of the drift could not be separated between residual uncorrected drift in the SBUV instrument, limited sensitivity of the SBUV to increases in tropospheric ozone, and the effect of local increases in pollution level on individual <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Seven {{years of}} total ozone data {{derived from the}} TOMS {{instrument}} on Nimbus- 7 are compared with results from 41 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations.</b> In this study, a significant improvement in fit from previous studies is obtained using a model which assumes {{a change in the}} rate of drift between TOMS and Dobson around the middle of 1982. Results indicate that the TOMS measurements have drifted relative to the <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> with a two-part linear trend of - 0. 25 + or - 0. 17 percent per year during the period from launch to 6 / 30 / 82, and - 0. 51 + or - 0. 21 percent per year during 7 / 1 / 82 - 10 / 31 / 85. The causes of this drift cannot be definitively separated between residual uncorrected drift in the TOMS instrument (a similar drift is apparent in the SBUV-Dobson comparisons), limited sensitivity of the TOMS to increases in tropospheric ozone, and the effect of local increases in pollution levels on individual <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

Until all data are reprocessed with the new algorithm users can use a table of correction factors given in this paper to make the data set internally consistent. This paper also presents a comparison of TOMS results with Amundsen Scott <b>Dobson</b> <b>station.</b> Though the agrement in most years is good, in 1983 - 84 the <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> reported unusually high values of ozone while TOMS saw the very low ozone values associated with the Antarctica ozone hole...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens <b>Dobson</b> <b>Station</b> since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique <b>Dobson</b> <b>station</b> in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|R

The columnar atmospheric ozone above the UVS (aircraft) is {{calculated from the}} ratios of the measured ultraviolet fluxes.

40|$|Annual {{extremes}} of total column amount of ozone (in the period 1964 - 1988) from a <b>network</b> of 29 <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> {{have been examined}} using the extreme value analysis. The extremes have been calculated as the highest deviation of daily mean total ozone from its long-term monthly mean, normalized by the monthly standard deviations. The extremes have been selected from the direct-Sun total ozone observations only. The extremes resulting from abrupt changes in ozone (day to day changes greater than 20 percent) have not been considered. The ordered extremes (maxima in ascending way, minima in descending way) have been fitted {{to one of three}} forms of the Fisher-Tippet extreme value distribution by the nonlinear least square method (Levenberg-Marguard method). We have found that the ordered extremes from a majority of <b>Dobson</b> <b>stations</b> lie close to Fisher-Tippet type III. The extreme value analysis of the composite annual extremes (combined from averages of the annual extremes selected at individual stations) has shown that the composite maxima are fitted by the Fisher-Tippet type III and the composite minima by the Fisher-Tippet type I. The difference between the Fisher-Tippet types of the composite extremes seems {{to be related to the}} ozone downward trend. Extreme value prognoses for the period 1964 - 2014 (derived from the data taken at: all analyzed stations, the North American, and the European stations) have revealed that the prognostic extremes are close to the largest annual extremes in the period 1964 - 1988 and there are only small regional differences in the prognoses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Charging <b>station</b> <b>network</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} links, during the large-scale operation progress of new energy vehicles. Due to the large number of charging <b>stations</b> in <b>network,</b> the number of batteries distributed in the whole charging <b>station</b> <b>network</b> is also very large. Timely and accurately delivering of replaced battery would save a lot of material and manpower costs and time. Therefore, battery optimal distribution problem in charging <b>station</b> <b>network</b> must be resolved. The main purpose of this paper is to design the power battery optimal distribution software.

40|$|Global {{total ozone}} has been mapped with the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instrument}} since November 1978. Very detailed daily maps are produced with this instrument {{which has a}} spatial resolution at nadir of 50 km. The data accuracy is better than 2 % under all weather conditions as evaluated by comparison with <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer <b>network</b> <b>stations.</b> Coverage is complete at all sunlit latitudes including the poles during non-polar night months. The general structure of southern hemisphere total ozone is a polar minimum surrounded by a circumpolar maximum. Over {{much of the year}} the gradients are quite small except for local midlatitude storms. However, during the spring months the difference between the minimum and the maximum grows with time. The boundary of the polar minimum is generally very sharp with a gradient of 10 Dobson units/ 100 km not uncommon, thus justifying the term "ozone hole" to describe this feature. A station in the boundary region will undergo very large changes in ozone as the position of the hole drifts and fluctuates. Finally, the ozone hole is destroyed as the polar vortex breaks down in November. These characteristics were illustrated during the Symposium in a motion picture of daily ozone maps for a complete year. A second motion picture shows the striking decrease of Antarctic ozone during each of the October months since 1979 to values near 140 Dobson units, far below the lowest (180 Dobson units) ever observed previously at any location. It is this decrease which is the subject of the current controversy over possible fluorocarbon effects on ozone. The data from TOMS show that dynamics are critical {{in the formation of the}} ozone hole. Total ozone in the Antarctic region is found to be highly correlated with air temperature in the lower stratosphere...|$|R
