5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as <b>kitchen</b> furniture and <b>factory</b> machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|R

The production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil to partially substitute petroleum diesel {{is one of the}} measures for solving the twin problems of environment pollution and energy shortage.

The reaction solution was a mixture of WCO, water, methanol and solvent (hexane). The main product was biodiesel consisted of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), of which methyl oleate was the main component. Effects of lipase, solvent, water, and temperature and flow of the reaction mixture on the synthesis of biodiesel were analyzed. The results indicate that a 91. 08 % of FAME can be achieved in the end product under optimal conditions.

High cholesterol {{is considered to be}} a major risk factor for coronary heart diseases (CHD). Although new drugs may be effective in lowering serum cholesterol, diet with low fat content and rich in fibres is still the cornerstone for therapy of hyperlipidemia. Dietary intervention studies have mostly been carried out by using dietary advise, group sessions and informative brochures for those persons who are considered at »high risk«. However it seems difficult for most people to change their life style and the result of these efforts has often been disappointing. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of workplace oriented dietary intervention on CHD risk factors especially cholesterol, in ferroalloy factory workers in Grundartangi, in western Iceland. The two hundred workers have at least one hot meal per day while working, provided by the <b>factory</b> <b>kitchen.</b> The GP's at Akranes Health Center are responsible for the health care of the workers. A nutritionist held three meetings with the study subjects including one where spouses were invited. In cooperation with the workers and the cook, the nutritionist changed the ingredients of the kitchen menu by lowering the total amount of calories, minimizing fat, especially saturated. 155 workers (thereof 20 women) were then followed-up for two years with regard to serum lipids, smoking, weight, dietary habits and exercise.

40|$|Most {{factories}} located {{outside of}} BOI industrial zones in Sri Lanka {{do not have}} proper sewage treatment systems. Due to {{the high number of}} employees, these factories are always encountered with the problem of handling large quantities of low strength sewage generated from lavatories, canteens and <b>kitchens.</b> In such <b>factories</b> sewage is usually handled using conventional septic tank - soakage pit systems. Such systems are commonly found infested with insects, and promote further breeding. They cause nuisance due to obnoxious odor, and is a major cause for severe ground and surface water pollution. It has been noted that these factories have critical problems of handling sewage during rainy season, especially when the factory is located in areas with high ground water table such as a marshy land or near a surface water body. The activated sludge suspended growth aerobic systems designed to treat sewage in most of the factories have various operational problems which increase the operator involvement and therefore the plants performance are operator dependent. Activated sludge suspended growth aerobic systems are more susceptible for sludge bulking which leads to poor effluent quality and the unbulking process is very difficult and ~time consuming. In addition to this, the several parameters such as SVI, MLVSS, etc have to be monitored carefully in the conventional activated sludge systems for the proper operation and the maintenance which increase the operational and the maintenance cost. The maintenance departments of factories always request a trouble free sewage treatment plant to minimize their involvement in operation of the plant. Therefore the submerged attached growth aerobic systems are becoming the most appropriate system as an alternative of the activated sludge system for treating low strength effluent, sewage from factories. A leading company in Sri Lanka which provides turnkey solutions for waste water and sewage has introduced submerged attached growth aerobic and anaerobic treatment systems to overcome above issues [...] Depending on the affordability of the client and the space availability they have introduce submerged attached growth aerobic systems in two ways. (a) Direct aerobic submerged attached growth systems where sewage is treated only with aerobic treatment (b) Anaerobic cum submerged attached growth aerobic systems where sewage is treated with anaerobic process prior to aerobic treatment. However no proper study has been carried out to find out the most appropriate submerged attached growth system to treat sewage generated from factories. Research suggested that the anaerobic cum submerged attached growth aerobic system is more suitable for treating factory sewage than direct aerobic submerged attached growth system in terms of quantity of sludge wasting and lower operational and maintenance cost which results to a lower unit cost per m 3 of treated water...|$|R
