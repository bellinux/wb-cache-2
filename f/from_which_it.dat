5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele {{correctly}} {{proposed that}} molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named molybdenum for the mineral {{in which it}} resided, and <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> might be isolated. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> borrowed non-linear exploration.

Metroid {{was also one of}} the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.|$|E
50|$|In Judaism, roe from kosher fish—fish with fins and scales—is {{considered}} kosher. Like fish in general, it {{is considered}} pareve. Roe is considered kosher only if the fish <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it's</b> harvested is kosher as well.

5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it grows on the ground on road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

There he received the return to imperial service of a number of Armenian lords, Melias, the three brothers Baasakios, Krigorikios and Pazounes, and Ismael, who were established as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern border.
