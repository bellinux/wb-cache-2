50|$|One of {{the major}} ways that <b>habitat</b> {{fragmentation}} affects biodiversity is by {{reducing the amount of}} suitable <b>habitat</b> available for organisms. <b>Habitat</b> fragmentation often involves both <b>habitat</b> destruction and the subdivision of previously continuous <b>habitat.</b> Plants and other sessile organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of <b>habitat</b> fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the <b>habitat.</b>|$|R
40|$|Peripheral populations often {{experience}} more extreme environmental conditions {{than those in}} the centre of a species' range. Such extreme conditions include <b>habitat</b> loss, defined as a reduction in the amount of suitable <b>habitat,</b> as well as <b>habitat</b> fragmentation, which involves the breaking apart of <b>habitat</b> independent of <b>habitat</b> loss. The 'threshold hypothesis' predicts that organisms will be more affected by <b>habitat</b> fragmentation when the amount of <b>habitat</b> on the landscape is scarce (i. e., less than 30 %) than when <b>habitat</b> is abundant, implying that <b>habitat</b> fragmentation may compound <b>habitat</b> loss through changes in patch size and configuration. Alternatively, the 'flexibility hypothesis' predicts that individuals may respond to increased <b>habitat</b> disturbance by altering their selection patterns and thereby reducing sensitivity to <b>habitat</b> loss and fragmentation. While the range of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) has contracted during recent decades, the relative importance of <b>habitat</b> loss and <b>habitat</b> fragmentation on this phenomenon is poorly understood. We used a <b>habitat</b> suitability model for lynx to identify suitable land cover in Ontario, and contrasted occupancy patterns across landscapes differing in cover, to test the 'threshold hypothesis' and 'flexibility hypothesis'. When suitable land cover was widely available, lynx avoided areas with less than 30 % <b>habitat</b> and were unaffected by <b>habitat</b> fragmentation. However, on landscapes with minimal suitable land cover, lynx occurrence was not related to either <b>habitat</b> loss or <b>habitat</b> fragmentation, indicating support for the 'flexibility hypothesis'. We conclude that lynx are broadly affected by <b>habitat</b> loss, and not specifically by <b>habitat</b> fragmentation, although occurrence patterns are flexible and dependent on landscape condition. We suggest that lynx may alter their <b>habitat</b> selection patterns depending on local conditions, thereby reducing their sensitivity to anthropogenically-driven <b>habitat</b> alteration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Habitat</b> loss {{is known}} to be the main cause of the current global decline in biodiversity, and roads are thought to affect the {{persistence}} of many species by restricting movement between <b>habitat</b> patches. However, measuring the effects of roads and <b>habitat</b> loss separately means that the configuration of <b>habitat</b> relative to roads is not considered. We present a new measure of the combined effects of roads and <b>habitat</b> amount: accessible <b>habitat.</b> We define accessible <b>habitat</b> as the amount of <b>habitat</b> that can be reached from a focal <b>habitat</b> patch without crossing a road, and make available a GIS tool to calculate accessible <b>habitat.</b> We hypothesize that accessible <b>habitat</b> will be the best predictor of the effects of <b>habitat</b> loss and roads for any species for which roads are a major barrier to movement. We conducted a case study of the utility of the accessible <b>habitat</b> concept using a data set of anuran species richness from 27 ponds near a motorway. We defined <b>habitat</b> as forest in this example. We found that accessible <b>habitat</b> was not only a better predictor of species richness than total <b>habitat</b> in the landscape or distance to the motorway, but also that by failing to consider accessible <b>habitat</b> we would have incorrectly concluded that there was no effect of <b>habitat</b> amount on species richness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Habitat</b> {{selection}} can {{be influenced}} by the distribution of the <b>habitat</b> types in the landscape as well as net gain in visiting patches of resources, causing individual variation in <b>habitat</b> selection. Moreover, the hypothesis of functional response in <b>habitat</b> selection predicts that the degree of selection of a resource depends on its relative availability. We used radio-telemetry data from individual moose on an island off the coast of northern Norway to evaluate whether the selection of <b>habitat</b> types at the landscape scale differed from the choice of <b>habitat</b> types within the home range, and investigated the functional response in <b>habitat</b> selection by relating individual <b>habitat</b> selection to home range characteristics. At the landscape scale, moose selected for <b>habitat</b> types that provided both good forage and cover, with small differences between sex and age groups. At the home range scale, all individuals selected <b>habitat</b> types that were associated with cover and low human impact. <b>Habitat</b> selection was not modified by local moose density, but was related to home range size at both spatial scales. Larger home ranges contained larger proportions of non-preferred <b>habitat</b> types compared to smaller home ranges.

40|$|Abstract. —With the {{widespread}} decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, {{there is a}} need to clearly define <b>habitat</b> requirements for effective species management and <b>habitat</b> restoration. Fish biologists often infer <b>habitat</b> requirements on the basis of correlative <b>habitat</b> associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e. g., instream <b>habitat</b> suitability curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, re-lationships based on <b>habitat</b> associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular <b>habitat</b> (i. e., necessity of a <b>habitat</b> for the persistence of individuals and populations). The assumption that <b>habitat</b> selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of <b>habitat</b> use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of <b>habitat</b> requirement usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival, or reproductive success) in different <b>habitat</b> types. Bioenergetic <b>habitat</b> models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative <b>habitat</b> suitability models for drift-feeding fish and have the potential t...|$|R
