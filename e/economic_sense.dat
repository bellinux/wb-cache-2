5|$|The rivers Mersey and Irwell {{were first}} made navigable {{in the early}} 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal (from 1776) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (from 1830), but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. In addition, Manchester's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool's docks and the railway companies as excessive. A ship canal was therefore proposed {{as a way of}} giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering from the effects of the Long Depression, and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound <b>economic</b> <b>sense.</b> They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary Act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.|$|E

40|$|Order picking {{represents}} one of the most complex and personnel-intensive challenges in logistic. Therefore it is essential to operate order picking systems efficiently. Because order structures fluctuate in seasonal, weekly or even daily periods, it demands an adaptation of order picking systems to assure efficiency. Despite of these fluctuations order picking systems still remain unchanged for al long duration. Today´s adaptations occur usually with the emphasus on technical reorganization, wich only makes good <b>economic</b> <b>senses</b> in terms of several years. In conclusion it is necessary to continuously adapt picking systems to fluctuating order structures in the short term. This can be achieved by changing the strategies of an order picking system already in use. This paper deals with the interdependency between different order structures and organizational strategies and their ongoing adjustment...|$|R

25|$|The National Water Strategy defines “water deficit” as “water demand” minus “water resources”. “Water demand” is {{not used}} in an <b>economic</b> <b>sense</b> where demand depends on price. Instead demand is defined as water needs derived from policy objectives. Thus the figure given in the {{strategy}} for water demand in agriculture - 1,080 million m3 (MCM)/year - is far greater than actual water use of about 600 MCM/year. In 2007, agriculture accounted for 72% of “water demand”, while the municipal share was 24% and the shares of tourism and industries were 3% and 1%, respectively. The water deficit of 565 million m3 (MCM)/year for 2007 thus is mainly caused by assumptions about “water needs” in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an <b>economic</b> <b>sense,</b> a stapelmarkt {{was a place where}} commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a legal monopoly for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important ancillary function of such a physical stock of commodities is that it makes it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

40|$|Humans derive many {{utilitarian}} {{benefits from}} the environmental services of biotas and ecosystems. This is often advanced as a prime argument to support conservation of biodiversity. There is much {{to be said for}} this viewpoint, as is documented in this paper through a summary assessment of several categories of environmental services, including regulation of climate and biogeochemical cycles, hydrological functions, soil protection, crop pollination, pest control, recreation and ecotourism, and a number of miscellaneous services. It is shown that the services are indeed significant, whether in ecological or <b>economic</b> <b>senses.</b> Particularly important is the factor of ecosystem resilience, which appears to underpin many of the services. It should not be supposed, however, that environmental services stem necessarily and exclusively from biodiversity. While biodiversity often plays a key role, the services can also derive from biomass and other attributes of biotas. The paper concludes with a brief overview assessment of economic values at issue and an appraisal of the implications for conservation planning...|$|R
