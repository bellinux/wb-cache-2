40|$|In this paper, {{longitudinal}} {{and lateral}} vehicle control for automated highway systems (AHS) are studied together for their coupling effects. It is shown that longitudinal controllers which <b>directly</b> <b>control</b> the <b>wheel</b> slip are inherently more stable, especially during lateral maneuvers on very slippery road conditions, than longitudinal controllers {{which do not}} take wheel slip into account...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> and rudder pedals. The <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} <b>control</b> <b>wheels.</b> The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw <b>control.</b> Nose <b>wheel</b> steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R

50|$|Investigators {{with the}} Civil Aeronautics Board {{determined}} that the cable physically connecting the first officer's <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> to the aileron boost unit had disconnected. This had caused the ailerons to put the aircraft in a starboard-wing-down attitude, and had prevented the pilots {{from being able to}} correct the bank. The cables attaching the pilots' <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> to the aileron boost unit had been removed two months before the accident during routine maintenance; a safety cable that held part of the assembly together had not been replaced when the cables were hooked back up. The contact slowly separated, until it completely failed during the takeoff sequence.|$|R

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the <b>wheels,</b> improving <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|R

50|$|Early {{submarines}} had separate {{controls for}} {{each pair of}} planes, bow and stern. Together with the helmsman, this required three ratings in the already-crowded control room. By the 1960s, combined controls were introduced. These incorporated all planes onto a single aircraft-style <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
