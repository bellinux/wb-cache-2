40|$|Professional <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> for {{teachers}} {{have become an}} increasing focus in the quest to improve teacher quality. In regional and remote areas of Australia the delivery of professional <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> can become problematic. This study compares and contrasts the two separate professional <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> evaluated (Programme A and Programme B), which were focused on aspiring leadership and delivered in the Northern Territory. Findings are presented which identify enablers for success in professional <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> delivered in remote areas. Programme A and Programme B varied in their levels of success in achieving stated goals. The findings suggest that when professional development is delivered to remotely located teachers, local context and shared experience become critical for success. Local agents and local leaders are shown to be {{an essential element of}} successful professional development in context. The results have implications for those developing and delivering professional <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> to remote locations...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{requirement}} for multi-cultural, transnationally competent managers in to-day's global economy. However, the impact of culture, positive and negative, on management <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> is often recognised, but not formally addressed. The cultural diversity of students undertaking management <b>development</b> <b>programmes,</b> such as an MBA, presents great opportunities to business school educators to facilitate the development of vital cross cultural management skills. Management <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> traditionally address interpersonal skills development. However, based on our experience presented here, providing training to develop cross cultural skills specifically will be of growing importance to students, business schools and multinational companies, as they consider the effectiveness of management <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> This article sets out several of the key cross cultural issues which we have identified as relevant to management <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> {{in an attempt to}} highlight the important impact of culture on students and teaching practice. These issues include teaching methods, tutor/student and peer group feedback, working in groups and cultural approaches to learning. We believe that such cultural issues can have a dra matic effect on students experience of management <b>development</b> <b>programmes.</b> We suggest a possible framework for initiating and developing cross cultural skills so that cultural richness can be taken from the classroom into the global boardroom...|$|R
