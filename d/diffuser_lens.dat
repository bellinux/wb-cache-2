40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the changes in ocular shape and relative peripheral refraction during the recovery from myopia produced by form deprivation (FD) and hyperopic defocus. FD was imposed in six monkeys by securing a <b>diffuser</b> <b>lens</b> over one eye; hyperopic defocus was produced in another six monkeys by fitting one eye with − 3 D spectacle. When unrestricted vision was re-established, the treated eyes recovered from the vision-induced central and peripheral refractive errors.

At 25 weeks of age, interocular differences (OD-OS) of the experimental group were significantly greater than interocular differences of age-matched normal monkeys for both axial length (P < 0. 05) and refractive error (P < 0. 02). In addition, while the treated eyes were significantly different from normal eyes for both axial length measurements (P < 0. 01) and refractive error (P < 0. 01), {{there were no significant differences}} between the untreated fellow eyes and normal eyes.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} whether {{changes in the}} eye’s effective refractive state produce changes in {{the thickness of the}} choroid in infant monkeys. METHODS. Normal developmental changes in choroidal thickness were studied in 10 normal rhesus monkeys. Hyperopia or myopia was induced by rearing 26 infant monkeys with either spectacle or <b>diffuser</b> <b>lenses</b> secured in front of one or both eyes. The treatment lenses were worn continuously beginning at approximately 3 weeks of age for an average of 120 days. Refractive status and ocular axial dimensions, including choroidal thickness, were measured by retinoscopy and high-frequency A-scan ultrasonography, respectively. RESULTS. Three lines of evidence indicate that the normal increase in choroidal thickness that occurs during early maturation can be altered by the eye’s refractive state. First, in monkeys experiencing form deprivation or those in the process of compensating for imposed optical errors, choroidal thickness and refractive error were significantly correlated with eyes developing myopia having thinner choroids than those developing hyperopia. Second, the choroids in eyes recovering from binocularly induced myopia increased in thickness at a faster rate than the choroids in recovering hyperopic eyes. Third, monkeys recovering from induced anisometropias showe...|$|R

We recently constructed a theory of refractive error development to investigate its fundamental properties. Our Incremental Retinal-Defocus Theory is based on the principle that the change in retinal-defocus mag-nitude during an increment of genetically-programmed ocular growth provides the requisite sign for the appropriate alteration in subsequent environmentally-induced ocular growth. This theory was tested under five experimental conditions: <b>lenses,</b> <b>diffusers,</b> occlusion, crystalline <b>lens</b> removal, and prolonged nearwork. Predic-tions of the theory were consistent with previous animal and human experimental findings. In addition, simulations using a MATLAB/SIMULINK model supported our theory by demonstrating quantitatively the appropriate directional changes in ocular growth rate. Thus, our Incremental Retinal-Defocus Theory provides a sim-ple and logical unifying concept underlying the mechanism for the development of refractive error. c © 2000 Society for Mathematical Biology 1...|$|R

In total, there were four experiments: (1) − 15 D lenses and/or diffusers on normal birds, (2) − 15 D lenses and/or diffusers on optic nerve-sectioned (ONS) birds, (3) − 5 /− 10 /− 15 D lenses (sequentially applied) and/or diffusers on normal birds and (4) − 5 /− 10 /− 15 D lenses and/or diffusers on ONS birds. All treatments were monocular. In all experiments, optical axial lengths (cornea-to-retina distances) in treated eyes were greater than in fellow eyes, irrespective of the optical device (<b>diffuser,</b> <b>lens</b> or switch), lens power (fixed or incremented) and optic nerve condition (intact or severed). In normal chicks, optical axial length responses in the switch group were significantly reduced relative to those of the diffuser but not to those of the − 15 D lens group. For both groups of ONS birds, diffusers exaggerated the optical axial length changes. For all groups, the responses to the switch and lens groups were most similar.

In this study we determined whether {{a few hours of}} unrestricted vision every day during the period of monocular form-deprivation prevents amblyopia and whether the behavioral outcome is associated with response alterations in V 1 and/or V 2. Seven infant macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were reared with a monocular <b>diffuser</b> <b>lens</b> in front of the right eye and a clear plano lens in the left eye between 3 weeks and 4 months of age. The rearing regimen included daily unrestricted-vision for one, two or four hours. When the monkeys were about 18 months of age, spatial contrast sensitivity functions were measured for the deprived and non-deprived eyes using operant psychophysical methods. Following the behavioral testing, microelectrode-recording experiments were conducted. Monkeys that experienced 4 hours of daily unrestricted vision did not develop amblyopia, while one or two hours of unrestricted vision was less effective in preventing amblyopia. There were no significant interocular differences in the monocular spatial-filter properties of V 1 or V 2 neurons, even in those monkeys that exhibited the most severe amblyopia. However, in V 2, but not in V 1, we could not find neurons dominated by the behaviorally amblyopic eye of these severely amblyopic monkeys. In less amblyopic monkeys, there was a high prevalence of interocular suppression, which was generally stronger in neurons dominated by the amblyopic eye. These results suggest that a severe functional loss of V 2 neurons dominated by the amblyopic eye is more closely associated with the neural mechanisms underlying the observed behaviorally demonstrated amblyopia than altered monocular response properties of V 1 or V 2 neurons...|$|E

40|$|The {{incandescent}} and {{fluorescent lighting}} systems {{which have been}} the most prominent electrical lighting choice for over 150 years are gradually being replaced in most homes with Light Emitting Diode (LED) Lighting Systems. This is due to their relatively low power consumption and good luminous intensity. LED lighting systems have revolutionized energy – efficient lighting. The significant feature of LEDs is that the light is directional with very low lagging power factor (0. 2 – 0. 6) as opposed to incandescent bulbs which spread the light more spherically with high power factor almost approaching unity. New LED designs address the directional limitation by using <b>diffuser</b> <b>lenses</b> and reflectors to disperse the light more. Since LED lighting represents a green technology, the issue of high power factor becomes very important. Power factor, defined as the ratio of real power consumed by a load (expressed in Watts) to apparent power (expressed in Volt-amperes), is a figure that ranges from zero to unity, it indicates the degree of distortion and phase shift in the current waveform. The work reported here proposes LED lighting system equipped with power factor correction driving circuit fed with dc – dc converter circuit. The power factor correction function is achieved by using switching converters circuit that operate directly from a full-wave rectified DC bus on a passive valley fill (PVF) circuit operating in Discontinuous Inductor Current Mode (DICM) for Power Factor Correction (PFC). This converter is simple to control, easy to construct and attractive for low cost application for domestic lighting.

Starting at about 3 weeks of age, <b>diffuser</b> spectacle <b>lenses</b> were employed to degrade the retinal image in one eye of 13 infant monkeys. The diffusers were worn continuously for periods ranging between 11 and 19 weeks. The effects of three different strengths of optical diffusers, which produced reductions in image contrast that ranged from about 0. 5 to nearly 3 log units, were assessed by retinoscopy and A-scan ultrasonography. Control data were obtained from ten normal infants and three infants reared with clear, zero-powered lenses over both eyes. Eleven of the 13 treated infants developed form-deprivation myopia. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for the three diffuser groups, however, the degree of axial myopia varied directly with the degree of image degradation. Thus, form-deprivation myopia in monkeys is a graded phenomenon and can be triggered by a modest degree of chronic image degradation...|$|R

Methods: Chicks were treated for 7 days either with centrally form-deprived (CFD) lenses of 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 mm diameter central diffuse zone, or a full size <b>diffuser</b> <b>lens</b> on their right eyes. The left eyes wore a full field plano lens. Axial dimensions and refractions were measured before and after 4 and 7 days of lens wear. Results: All eyes that had worn CFD lenses of 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 mm had significant changes in refractive errors (from - 2. 69 ± 0. 40 D to - 6. 13 ± 0. 76 D, p < 0. 05), vitreous chamber depth (from 0. 19 ± 0. 04 mm to 0. 56 ± 0. 04 mm, p < 0. 05) and axial length (from 0. 42 ± 0. 03 mm to 0. 96 ± 0. 04 mm, p < 0. 05) during the experiment, except for the changes in refractive error (- 2. 81 ± 0. 33 D, p = 0. 053) and axial length (0. 77 ± 0. 04 mm, p = 0. 050) in the 2 mm lens group after 7 days of lens wear. The myopic shift in the CFD lens wearing eyes was due primarily to an increase in vitreous chamber depth. Linear regression analysis showed that the changes of refractive error, vitreous chamber depth and axial length were positively correlated with the size of central form-deprived retina. Form depriving the central retina produced axial myopia even in the presence of clear peripheral vision. Conclusions: The current study showed that both the central and peripheral retina contributes to myopia development in chicks. The amount of myopia induced increased linearly with the area of retina being form-deprived. It suggests that in terms of decoding optical input for growth, the area of retina being exposed to optical signals may be critical in determining eye growth. School of Optometr...|$|E

H 577 P SO 2016 Yu 405 pages :illustrationsThe high {{prevalence}} of myopia and its related complications of myopia pose {{a heavy burden}} to society and individuals. To date, uncorrected refractive error is recognized as the major cause of avoidable visual impairment globally. Rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS) and quantitative proteomic methods have made proteomics a tool of choice for studying biomarkers and pathogenesis in many diseases. In this study, the advanced MS coupled to novel proteomic techniques were applied in myopia research. Identification of proteins in a tissue is the fundamental and essential step in typical proteomics. Using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1 D gel) followed by nanoflow liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-ionTrap MS/MS), a total of 341 and 1021 distinct proteins were identified in normal growing chick vitreous and retina, respectively, by searching against the International Protein Index (IPI) chick protein database. Among them, 196 common proteins were found shared. The constituent of proteins in these two tissues were found similar when they were classified according to their known biological activities (BP) and molecular functions (MF). The major {{difference between these two}} tissues was in cellular components in which relatively more proteins in the vitreous were in extracellular region and extracellular matrix, while the majority of retinal proteins were in cell part and organelle. These protein profiles set as fundamental ground works for follow up studies. Differentially expressed proteins during ocular growth may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of myopia. Quantitative proteomics using Isotope Coded Protein Labeling (ICPL) technique was applied in studying the ametropic vitreous (+ 10 D/- 10 D lens inducement for 3 and 7 days). Four proteins (apolipoprotein A 1, purpurin, cystatin and ovotransferrin) were detected with up-regulated expression levels in the myopic eye after wearing - 10 D lenses for 3 days. It was the first report of up-regulated expression of Apolipoprotein A 1 in lens-induced myopic chick vitreous. Network analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software indicated that anoxidative stress and lipid metabolism may be involved in the myopic progression. Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{ 490 }) signaling pathway may also participate in regulating ocular growth with its connection to Apolipoprotein A 1 and cystatin. Quantitative proteomics was also performed in chick retina wearing - 10 D/+ 10 D lenses (3 and 7 days) and <b>diffuser</b> <b>lenses</b> (7 hours, 3 and 7 days). Based on the differentially expressed proteins, {{it was found that the}} retinal protein targets were mainly of cytoplasmic origin in both paradigms. According to the bioinformatics analysis, various metabolisms and glycolysis process were suggested to regulate or participate in myopic ocular growth. Moreover, several common proteins found in both lens-inducement and form-deprivation suggested possible common signaling pathways shared between these two paradigms. On the other hand, ApoA 1 was found down-regulated after lens inducement but not significantly changed after form deprivation, which could suggest a co-existence of independent pathways. In addition, protein pathway analysis of all differentially expressed retinal protein further revealed insulin signaling pathway that was previously reported to be related to myopia progression. In addition to studying protein abundance levels in the chick retina, the feasibility of applying phosphoproteomic technology in myopia research was explored in short term lens treatment (- 10 D/+ 10 D, 3 days). By using a titanium dioxide enrichment approach coupled to a next generation nanoLC Triple Time of Flight MS, a total of 290 proteins (381 phosphopeptides) in myopic retina with 401 phosphorylation sites were detected. In the hyperopic retina, 249 proteins (347 phosphopeptides) with 372 phosphorylation sites were detected. Majority of detected phosphopeptides using TiO{ 208 } enrichment was single-phosphorylated, with a small minority detected as double-phosphorylation (the ratio is approximately 9 : 1). Peptides with triple-phosphorylation were rare. This application provided a new and complementary research direction for future myopia study. Using both discovery profiling and targeted proteomics verification, the study supported some protein candidates which were reported by previous myopia studies. A number of novel protein targets were also found with possible regulatory pathways suggested by emerging bioinformatics tool. High-throughput quantitative proteomics was proven as a vital tool in searching for new therapeutic options for future myopia study. School of OptometryPh.

40|$|AbstractYoung animals {{compensate}} for defocus imposed by {{positive or negative}} spectacle lenses by adjusting the elongation rate of their vitreous chambers, thus matching {{the length of the}} eye with the focal length of the eye’s optics combined with the spectacle lenses. The ability to {{compensate for}} either negative or positive lenses could rely on the ability to distinguish between myopic and hyperopic blur, or it could rely on the fact that positive lenses would bring nearby objects into focus, thereby reducing the amount of blur, whereas negative lenses would not. This study asks whether eyes emmetropize using the magnitude of blur or the sign of blur as a directional cue.

These findings argue both that the eye can discern the sign of the blur and that choroidal and ocular-elongation components of the refractive compensation do not respond identically to visual inputs...|$|R

The wind lens with a flat-panel-type diffuser demonstrated power augmentation by a factor of 2. 0 compared with an open wind turbine. An increase from 5 ° to 20 ° in the semi-open angle of the diffuser made it possible to generate a 30 % high power output over a wide range of tip speed ratios. On that basis, an optimum semi-open angle was determined. For the flat-panel-type diffuser, a recommended diffuser length is the half of the throat width, and its semi-open angle is 20 °.

To further elucidate the role of ZENK in the modulation of ocular growth, we investigated the effect of intravitreal injections of the muscarinic antagonist atropine and the dopamine agonist 2 -amino- 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (ADTN), both of which block the development of experimental myopia, on the expression of ZENK in eyes fitted with negative-lenses. Methods: Myopia was induced by fitting translucent diffusers or − 10 D polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) lenses over one eye of the chicken.

40|$|PURPOSE. Whether either natural emmetropization or compen-sation for imposed {{spectacle}} lenses requires the visual system to distinguish myopic from hyperopic blur is controversial. Some {{have argued that}} the visual system need only respond to the magnitude of the blur. This study was undertaken to test whether adding large amounts of astigmatic image blur would cause myopia and interfere with compensation for positive or negative {{spectacle lenses}}. METHODS. Chicks were fitted with mixed astigmatic (toric) lenses with 5 D on one meridian and 5 D on the orthogonal meridian (Jackson crossed cylinders), thus producing massive blur while having no spherical equivalent power. Chicks wore these lenses either alone or in combination with 6 D, 3 D, 3 D, or 6 D spherical lenses. To produce a similar degree of image degradation in a different way, other chicks were fitted with weak diffusers, with or without spherical lenses. RESULTS. Eyes fitted with astigmatic lenses alone became mildly hyperopic, whereas those fitted with weak diffusers became mildly myopic. Eyes wearing both the astigmatic and spherical lenses compensated as completely for the spherical lenses as did the eyes wearing spherical lenses alone—the compensa-tion being caused by changes in both choroidal thickness and ocular length. Eyes wearing weak <b>diffusers</b> and spherical <b>lenses</b> also compensated but did so without a change in choroidal thickness. CONCLUSIONS. Severe astigmatic blur does not interfere with spectacle lens compensation. From this it can be inferred that the average amount of blur is not an important error signal for spectacle lens compensation and therefore probably not for emmetropization either. These results strengthen the case that the sign of defocus is used to direct eye growth. (Inves...|$|R

We therefore investigated the expression of Pax 6 RNA transcripts in the chicken retina during periods of increased ocular growth, induced by form-deprivation and negative lens-wear, and during periods of decreased ocular growth, induced by diffuser removal from previously form-deprived eyes, and plus lens-wear. Levels of Pax 6 RNA transcripts in the chicken retina were measured using semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR, at times between 1 h and 10 days after the fitting of <b>diffusers</b> or negative <b>lenses,</b> and at times between 1 h and 3 days following the removal of diffusers from previously form-deprived eyes, or the addition of plus lenses. Pax 6 expression was unaffected during the initial 3 days of the response to form-deprivation or negative lens-wear, when rapid rates of growth are well-established. Alterations in the expression of Pax 6 RNA transcripts were only observed after 7 – 10 days of form-deprivation (7 days, − 15. 7 ± 5. 3 %; 10 days, − 32. 0 ± 10. 3 %), with a similar response not seen during negative lens-wear, when eye growth also increases, suggesting that these alterations are specific to form-deprivation, rather to changes in the rate of eye growth. The late changes in Pax 6 expression observed during form-deprivation were rapidly reversed after diffuser removal, with the levels of Pax 6 RNA transcripts returning to those seen in control birds by 3 days (1 h, − 27. 8 ± 4. 7 %; 1 day, − 16. 9 ± 4. 8 %; 3 days + 1. 0 ± 8. 6 %). Analogous changes were not seen in response to positive lenses in which eye growth is also slowed. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} do not support a role for Pax 6 in the modulation of ocular growth during visual manipulation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Myopia can {{be induced}} in {{chickens}} {{by having them}} wear either negative lenses (lens-compensation myopia [LCM]) or diffusers (form-deprivation myopia [FDM]), whereas posi-tive lenses cause lens-compensation hyperopia (LCH). These three conditions were compared with respect to (i) their early time course and (ii) the effect of two manipulations of the lighting. METHODS. Longitudinal changes in ocular dimensions and re-fractive error were measured in chicks maintained under three different conditions: (i) wearing either 215 D lenses or dif-fusers in a normal light/dark cycle; (ii) wearing either 115 D lenses, 215 D <b>lenses,</b> or <b>diffusers</b> with brief periods of strobo-scopic lights {{at the beginning and}} end of the dark period; (iii) wearing either 16 D lenses, 26 D <b>lenses,</b> or <b>diffusers</b> with the nights interrupted by brief periods of white light. In addition, scleral and choroidal proteoglycan synthesis was measured in eyes that wore positive lenses, negative <b>lenses,</b> or <b>diffusers</b> for 3 hours followed by different periods of darkness. RESULTS. (i) The time course of the changes in axial length over the first 72 hours was significantly faster in LCM than in FDM. Indeed, the diffusers did not begin to significantly affect the total length of the globe for 3 days, although the vitreous chamber had deepened after 9 hours, because the choroid thinned extremely rapidly (within 1 hour) with either <b>diffusers</b> or negative <b>lenses.</b> (ii) Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was higher in eyes with negative lenses than in those with diffusers at 11 hours, but the reverse was true at 27 hours. (iii) Brief periods of stroboscopic light attenuated FDM more than LCM. (iv) In contrast, interruption of the nights by brief periods of light attenuated LCM more than FDM. (v) Neither lighting manipulation affected LCH. (vi) Choroidal proteoglycan syn-thesis decreased similarly with 3 hours of wearing either dif-fusers or negative lenses. CONCLUSIONS. Although both negative <b>lenses</b> and <b>diffusers</b> cause similar increases in the rate of ocular elongation, the responses differ in time course and in the effect of manipulations of the daily lighting. The responses to positive lenses differ from bot...|$|R
40|$|Retinal image {{properties}} such as {{contrast and}} spatial frequency play {{important roles in}} the development of normal vision. For example, visual environments comprised solely of low contrast and/or low spatial frequencies induce myopia. The visual image is processed by the retina and it then locally controls eye growth. In terms of the retinal neurotransmitters that link visual stimuli to eye growth, there is strong evidence to suggest involvement of the retinal dopamine (DA) system. For example, effectively increasing retinal DA levels by using DA agonists can suppress the development of form-deprivation myopia (FDM). However, whether visual feedback controls eye growth by modulating retinal DA release, and/or some other factors, is still being elucidated. This thesis is chiefly concerned with the relationship between the dopaminergic system and retinal image properties in eye growth control. More specifically, whether the amount of retinal DA release reduces as the complexity of the image degrades was determined. For example, we investigated whether the level of retinal DA release decreased as image contrast decreased. In addition, the effects of spatial frequency, spatial energy distribution slope, and spatial phase on retinal DA release and eye growth were examined. When chicks were 8 -days-old, a cone-lens imaging system was applied monocularly (+ 30 D, 3. 3 cm cone). A short-term treatment period (6 hr) and a longer-term treatment period (4. 5 days) were used. The short-term treatment tests for the acute reduction in DA release by the visual stimulus, as is seen with <b>diffusers</b> and <b>lenses,</b> whereas the 4. 5 day point tests for reduction in DA release after more prolonged exposure to the visual stimulus. In the contrast study, 1. 35 cyc/deg square wave grating targets of 95 %, 67 %, 45 %, 12 % or 4. 2 % contrast were used. Blank (0 % contrast) targets were included for comparison. In the spatial frequency study, both sine and square wave grating targets with either 0. 017 cyc/deg and 0. 13 cyc/deg fundamental spatial frequencies and 95 % contrast were used. In the spectral slope study, 30 % root-mean-squared (RMS) contrast fractal noise targets with spectral fall-off of 1 /f 0. 5, 1 /f and 1 /f 2 were used. In the spatial alignment study, a structured Maltese cross (MX) target, a structured circular patterned (C) target and the scrambled versions of these two targets (SMX and SC) were used. Each treatment group comprised 6 chicks for ocular biometry (refraction and ocular dimension measurement) and 4 for analysis of retinal DA release. Vitreal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was analysed through ion-paired reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), as a measure of retinal DA release. For the comparison between retinal DA release and eye growth, large reductions in retinal DA release possibly due to the decreased light level inside the cone-lens imaging system were observed across all treated eyes while only those exposed to low contrast, low spatial frequency sine wave grating, 1 /f 2, C and SC targets had myopic shifts in refraction. Amongst these treatment groups, no acute effect was observed and longer-term effects were only found in the low contrast and 1 /f 2 groups. These findings suggest that retinal DA release does not causally link visual stimuli properties to eye growth, and these target induced changes in refractive development are not dependent on the level of retinal DA release. Retinal dopaminergic cells might be affected indirectly via other retinal cells that immediately respond to changes in the image contrast of the retinal image...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Daylighting {{is the use of}} natural light to replace artificial light. In traditional rooms sunlight will only illuminate the area closest to the window due to the high solar angle. The rear of the room appears gloomy and occupants will use electric lighting even though there is sufficient daylight to illuminate the interior. The first section of this thesis reports on the application of micro-prisms to glazing. Such systems could improve the penetration of the light and reduce the energy bill. Fig 1 : (Left) : A traditional window. (Right) A window with the top third coated in microprisms. The aim of the work is to develop suitable structures than can be easily and cheaply mass produced using an industrial UV embossing process. Whenever possible the requirements of this process dictate the physical characteristics of the microstructures. The development process includes all the stages from design to full-scale testing of the prototypes in an office. Several different mechanical methods are used to produce prismatic arrays that conform to an initial design calculation. Each sample is evaluated in terms of its physical characteristics, its optical properties and finally its ability to improve illumination within a room. The latter aspect is determined, not only by measurement, but also the subjective assessment of occupants. The second micro-textured surface to be examined is the microlens. Three systems are investigated: - A controlled <b>diffuser</b> incorporating cylindrical <b>lenses</b> to improve the distribution of the daylight. - An afocal pair of lenses to improve the penetration of daylight through beam-steering. - An angular filter to exclude direct sunlight while admitting diffuse light. Most of the research is concerned with the third system. On sunny days windows can cause sufficient glare that occupants will pull the venetian blinds. Not only will this exclude the direct sunlight but also the diffuse daylight, cause darkening of the room and leading to the use of artificial light. The angular filter or 'solar shade' uses microlenses to image the direct sunlight which can then be blocked by circular obturations. The diffuse sunlight is not focused and therefore transmitted so the room is not darkened. The research is based on experimentation with small-scale systems and computer modelling to optimise the system. The results show potential improvements over new 'smart' windows although mechanical tolerances are high...|$|R
40|$|Changes in retinal crystallin gene {{expression}} have {{been implicated in}} the development of myopia in animal models. We therefore investigated the expression of αB-crystallin (cryab) in the chicken retina during periods of increased ocular growth induced by form-deprivation and negative lens-wear, and during periods of decreased ocular growth induced by diffuser removal from previously form-deprived eyes, and plus lens-wear. Cryab RNA transcript levels in the chicken retina were measured using semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR, at times between 1 h and 10 days after the fitting of <b>diffusers</b> or negative <b>lenses,</b> and at times between 1 h and 3 days following the removal of diffusers from previously form-deprived eyes, or the addition of plus lenses. Changes in expression for each condition at each time-point are analysed relative to expression in retinas from age-matched untreated control birds. No change in relative expression of cryab RNA transcript was detected 1 h after fitting diffusers to induce form-deprivation myopia. A transient increase in cryab RNA transcript expression was detected around 1 day later (p = 0. 02), but expression returned to control levels after three days. After 7 (p = 0. 005) and 10 (p = 0. 001) days, retinal cryab RNA transcript expression progressively increased relative to controls. After removal of the diffusers, to initiate recovery, cryab RNA transcript expression remained elevated, with only a slight return to control levels. During the development of lens-induced myopia, no changes in cryab RNA transcript expression relative to controls were seen on day 1, but increases were seen at 10 days (p = 0. 004). No significant changes in retinal cryab RNA transcript expression were seen in response to plus lenses compared to either contralateral control values (MANOVA; F = 0. 60, p = 0. 48) or age-matched untreated values (MANOVA; F = 4. 10, p = 0. 08). Changes in retinal cryab RNA transcript expression were not systematically related to changes in the rate of eye growth. The role of the transient increase in cryab expression observed after 1 day of form-deprivation, which was not seen after fitting negative lenses, is unclear. The later increases in relative cryab expression seen during the development of form-deprivation and lens-induced myopia occur too late to have {{a major role in the}} differential regulation of eye growth between experimental and control eyes. Given that cryab is a member of the small heat shock protein family, the later increases may reflect the emergence of cell damage related to high myopic pathology in the experimentally enlarged eyes and retina...|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{degenerative}} {{diseases such}} as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration {{are one of the}} leading causes of blindness worldwide. Currently, there are a limited amount of treatment methods for these diseases. Therefore, many studies conducted in the field of vision research examine the functioning of the retina and try to find possible treatment methods for different retinal degenerative diseases. 	The most common way of studying the functioning of retinal cells is to record an electroretinogram (ERG). ERG is a light-evoked extracellular field potential that sums up the activity of retinal cells. Different wave components of ERG can be attributed to specific cell layers, thus enabling tracking of the origin of possible abnormalities in the ERG. ERG can be recorded both from humans and animals, and in vision research, mice and rats are popular animal models because of their genetic manipulations. Their retinas also correspond well with the human peripheral retina and their photoreceptors are quite similar to human photoreceptors. 	The retina is typically stimulated by light in vision research. The objective of this thesis is to construct a reliable light stimulation setup for retinal recordings of isolated mouse retinas. This thesis designs, constructs, and tests such stimulation setup. In the literature part of the thesis, the theory related to the functioning of the eye as well as the working principle of the ERG is discussed. In the research part, the stimulation setup is designed and constructed. As a result, the functioning of the setup is tested. 	The light source of the stimuli is a light-emitting diode (LED) that has a wavelength of 505 nm in order to cover the peak absorption wavelengths of the mouse retina. The LED {{has to be able to}} produce stimulus pulses with adjustable intensities, durations, forms, and frequencies. The LED is controlled via a stimulus generator and an LED controller. The light beam is guided from the LED to the retinal sample with a liquid light guide. Furthermore, the light beam is homogenized and gathered with <b>diffuser</b> and condenser <b>lenses</b> and its intensity is decreased with neutral density filters. The recording of the ERG is done with a microelectrode array (MEA) that is placed inside a Faraday cage. The retinal sample is placed on the MEA plate and kept alive with continuous perfusion. 	The setup was tested in order to evaluate its functionality. The testing was done by calibrating the light output and by recording ERGs from isolated mouse retina. The light calibration results showed linear intensity behaviour and an ability to produce different waveforms. The ERG recordings showed typical waveforms. The setup met the requirements and it can therefore be regarded as successful...|$|R
