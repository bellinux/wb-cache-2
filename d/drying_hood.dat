40|$|The {{drying process}} of paper has many {{production}} parameters that can influence both the energy consumed and {{the characteristics of}} paper produced. It was found {{that most of the}} previous studies conducted on this process assume that the conditions of the facilities are always appropriate. The control of the variables associated with air circulating inside the <b>drying</b> <b>hood</b> is essential to obtain a paper with adequate quality and obtain low ratios of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. This article proposes a new indirect method based on the study of the enthalpy of the airflows inside the production hall and thermographic images that helps to analyze the maintenance state of the enclosure hood drying section in a general process, whereby it can also estimate the emissions and energy losses. The combined use of sensors and equipment has helped to identify energy losses and potential savings in CO 2 emissions. The developed method is applied to a paper manufacturing plant that has ratios of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions very close to the product benchmark set by the European Authorities. The study corroborates that it can be identified as a significant energy loss in paper making drying process. Analyzing facilities that are in apparently good maintenance conditions, leaks are evident. These energy losses are very significant compared with the theoretical energy consumption, and it can affect the paper moisture profile.

Foram utilizados tubetes plásticos cônicos com volume de 75 mL, acondicionados em bandejas com capacidade para 198 tubetes. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi blocos casualizados, em esquema fatorial de 6 x 3, sendo os fatores compostos pelos seis diferentes substratos e três diferentes doses do corretivo à base de Lithothamnium, compondo assim, dezoito tratamentos com quatro repetições, sendo cada parcela composta por vinte e duas plântulas. Decorridos cem dias após a semeadura, as plântulas foram retiradas dos tubetes, seccionadas na base do coleto,e registrados os comprimentos da parte aérea e da raiz. Em seguida a biomassa seca da raiz e da parte aérea foram avaliadas. Verificou-se que o húmus e o composto I, isoladamente apresentaram os melhores resultados de crescimento. O corretivo à base de Lithothamnium mostrou ser uma alternativa de incremento nutricional para o crescimento de mudas de citrumeleiro 'Swingle', em condições de pH baixas, e com pouca disponibilidade de Ca e Mg.

Ap?s incuba??o, as medi??es dos halos de inibi??o foram realizadas ap?s 18 horas com uma r?gua milimetrada. Apenas a pasta de EGB e ZnO obteve atividade antimicrobiana estatisticamente significante com resultados similares ao controle positivo e foi submetida ? macrodilui??o para que fosse verificada a concentra??o inibit?ria m?nima, mas nenhuma dilui??o da pasta foi capaz de evitar o crescimento de E. faecalis.

In Endodontics, it aspires to be an ideal intracanal medicament against resistant strains in refractory endodontic infections. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to test the antimicrobial activity of Musa paradisiaca glycolic extract. To perform the experiment, the Musa paradisiaca glycolic extract replaced Polyethylene glycol 400, which is a vehicle that makes up some pastes used as Endodontic intracanal medication. Well agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity against strains of Enterococcus faecalis usually related to refractory endodontic infections. Different materials were inserted in wells in two experimental steps as characterized in the following groups. Experiment A : Group 1, Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400 - negative control); Group 2, PEG 400 and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2); Group 3, Musa paradisiaca Glycolic Extract (EGB); Group 4, EGB and Ca(OH) 2; Group 5, 2 % chlorhexidine gel (CHX - positive control). Experiment B : Group 1, PEG 400 (negative control); Group 2, PEG 400 and zinc oxide (ZnO); Group 3, PEG 400, Ca(OH) 2 and ZnO; Group 4, ZnO and EGB; Group 5, EGB, Ca(OH) 2 and ZnO; Group 6, CHX (positive control). After incubation, measurements of inhibition zones were performed after 18 hours with a millimeter ruler. Just EGB and ZnO paste obtained statistically significant antimicrobial activity with similar results to the positive control and was subjected to macrodilution, a finding for minimum inhibitory concentration, but no dilution of the paste was able to prevent the growth of E. faecalis. These data were treated statistically at 95 % significance using the Mann-Whitney test and Descriptive Statistics. The composition of EGB was assessed by Mass Spectrometry with Electrospray Ionization and it was found that one of the major components could be maltose. Thin Layer Chromatography (CCD) was carried out in phases of ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and aqueous partition resulting from liquid/liquid held in EGB, after <b>drying</b> under a <b>hood.</b> CCD suggested the presence of flavonoids, terpenes, tannins and steroids in EGB. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was performed in order to also propose the composition of EGB and observed a large number of signal peaks in the region concerning the glycosides, as well as peaks corresponding to the structure of terpenes and a few characteristic of steroids. The EGB showed antimicrobial activity when combined with ZnO and can be an alternative to the composition of an intracanal medication. Every new biomaterial based on ethnobotany should be carefully tested to allow its clinical applicability, which justified the relevance of this preliminary study; however physico-chemical and biocompatibility tests are essential to future employment of herbal medicines in Endodontic...|$|R

Alternatively, centrifuge the mixture for 5 min at 3000 rpm. - *Avoid an excessively strong vacuum, which can cause the mixture to spill out of the beaker*. 10. Cast a 5 -mm thick layer of degassed PDMS mixture onto the resist master. Cure it for 2 h in a 60 °C oven. 11. Gently peel off the PDMS layer. - *The microstructures {{can be seen at}} the surface of the PDMS layer when viewed through a microscope. See Troubleshooting*. 12. Using a microscope and transmitted light, locate the region of interest containing the desired micropattern geometries. With a scalpel, excise 1 -cm 2 stamps. Larger regions can be excised, but stamps larger than 1 cm 2 are not easy to handle. - *Store stamps in a closed container away from dust (a Petri dish sealed with Parafilm works well). Stamps can be kept for months before being used. Adhesive tape can be used to clean dusty stamps, although, for small features, it is better to use stamps that have been cleaned by sonication*. *Substrate Preparation* *See Figure 3 for an overview of preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip*. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. Preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip. *The substrate described here is a glass coverslip coated with polystyrene. A tissue culture polystyrene dish can also be used. A short plasma or UV/ozone activation step (if the equipment is available) will enhance protein adhesion and cell attachment (Van Kooten et al. 2004). Proteins can be covalently bound to one another on polystyrene using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Grabarek and Gergely 1990). For a useful handbook on conjugation techniques, see Hermanson (2008) *. 13. Wash the glass coverslip with ethanol. Dry the coverslip with filtered air or let it <b>dry</b> in the <b>hood.</b> - *Sonicate the coverslip in ethanol to optimize dust removal*. 14. Spin coat the coverslip as follows: - i. Place the coverslip on the spin coater. - ii. Deposit a few drops of the adhesion promoter AP 6000 onto the glass. - iii. Spin coat the coverslip for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to cover the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer). - iv. Dry the AP 6000 layer. - *The adhesion promoter ensures that the polystyrene will attach to the glass*. 15. Coat with polystyrene as follows: - i. Prepare a solution of 2 % polystyrene solution in toluene (2 %) and place a few drops of it on the AP 6000 -treated coverslip. - ii. Spin coat for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to coat the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer of polystyrene). - iii. After the spin coating, dry the polystyrene layer. - *If a spin coater is not available for use in Steps 14 and 15, spread the drops manually by handling the coverslip with tweezers and displacing the drop with an orbital rotation of the coverslip. After coating the coverslip, remove excess liquid with a tissue. If this alternative method is used, reduce the polystyrene to 0. 5 % so that the polystyrene layer will not be too thick*. - *Glass coverslips covered with polystyrene can be stored at room temperature for days. Oxidation of the substrate (Step 17) should be carried out immediately before the substrate is stamped (Step 20) *. *Microcontact Printing* *See Figure 4 for an overview of stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG*. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG. 16. Place a 20 -μL drop of 50 μg/mL fibronectin in PBS onto the microstructured surface of a 1 -cm 2 stamp. Spread the fibronectin solution across the stamp surface with the tip of the pipette by moving it toward each corner of the stamp. Leave the inked stamp for ~ 30 min to allow the fibronectin to adsorb to the PDMS. - *Spreading the fibronectin is necessary because the PDMS is hydrophobic. The surface of the stamp can be gently touched without damaging it*. 17. Transfer the polystyrene-coated coverslip (from Step 15) into a plasma cleaner. Turn on the pump to create a vacuum in the chamber. Allow a low flow of oxygen into the chamber and apply an oscillating electric field at 30 W for 10 sec. - *Tissue culture polystyrene dish substrates can be printed on without plasma oxidation, but plasma treatment (as described here) significantly improves printing and passivation efficiencies. Polystyrene Petri dishes (not activated for tissue culture) can also be used, provided they are activated by plasma treatment*. - *Stamp oxidized substrates (Step 20) within 15 min of activating them*. - *Substrate activation can also be performed in a UV/ozone cleaner (λ < 200 nm) *. 18. Aspirate off the fibronectin drop and immediately add a large drop of PBS to the surface before it dries. Repeat the PBS wash two more times to remove all of the unadsorbed fibronectin. 19. Remove the PBS drop and let the stamp dry in the airflow of a hood (it will take from a few seconds up to 1 min). The stamp is ready for printing when the surface appears dry while looking at light reflecting from it. *See Troubleshooting*. 20. Grasp the dry stamp with tweezers, invert the stamp, and place the microstructured surface in contact with the activated substrate (from Step 17). Briefly apply gentle pressure with the tweezers to ensure good contact between the stamp and the substrate. Leave the stamp in contact with the substrate for 1 min. - *This step is absolutely critical for success and requires practice to achieve satisfactory results*. 21. Remove the stamp and immerse it into H 2 O in a 50 -mL culture tube. 22. Prepare 0. 1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG solution in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7. 4). Immerse the printed substrate in this solution for 30 min. To minimize the amount of PLL-g-PEG used, place a 100 -μL drop on the substrate and cover it with a piece of Parafilm. - *The PLL-g-PEG renders the nonprinted areas resistant to cell adhesion. See Troubleshooting*. 23. During PLL-g-PEG adsorption, clean the stamp. Heat the culture tube containing the stamp at 60 °C and sonicate it in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Then sonicate the stamp in ethanol for 15 min. - *This cleaning procedure might not remove all the protein from the stamp. If another type of protein is to be stamped, it is better to use a new stamp*. 24. Dry the clean stamp under a hood for 1 h. Return the stamp to its storage container. 25. Wash the PLL-g-PEG-grafted substrate with PBS for 2 min and then for 10 min. - *The substrate is now ready for cell deposition. If not used immediately, it can be stored immersed in PBS or dried and stored under argon at 4 °C for up to 1 wk*. **Cell Deposition** *Micropatterned substrates prepared using this protocol have been used successfully with the following cells: HeLa-B, RPE 1, MCF 10 A, MCF 7, NIH 3 T 3, HepaRG, MDCK, and human mesenchymal stem cells, as well as dendritic cells derived from murine bone marrow*. 26. Wash adherent cells in PBS. Detach the cells with trypsin-EDTA (for 5 - 10 min, depending on the dilution used) or Versen EDTA. 27. Add complete culture medium to the flask and collect the cells by centrifugation for 3 min at 1500 rpm. 28. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in complete culture medium at 50, 000 cells/mL. 29. Add the cell solution to the micropatterned substrate (from Step 25). The final cell density should be ~ 10, 000 cells/cm 2. Place the cell-covered substrate into a tissue culture incubator. - *The incubation time depends upon the cell line (e. g., 15 - 30 min for RPE 1 and 30 - 60 min for HeLa-B) *. 30. Check the cells under a microscope to determine if a sufficiently large proportion of cells have attached to the micropatterns. 31. Remove unattached cells with a gentle flow of medium added {{to one side of the}} dish and aspirated from the other side. - *Keep the cells moist; do not allow them to become exposed to the air. The physicochemical properties of PEG can cause dewetting, leading the attached cells to quickly dry out*. 32. Return the attached cells to the incubator. Let them spread fully (1 - 5 h, depending on the cell type). 33. Fix or video-record the cells. *See Figure 5 for examples of cells attached to micropatterns*. ![Figure 5]([URL] "Figure 5 ") **Figure 5 **. Images of cells on micropatterns.

Scale bar, 100 μm. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Separating the PDMS layer from the photoresist master destroys the master. **[Step 11]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Curing the PDMS mixture (Step 10) for more than 2 h at 60 °C can induce PDMS binding to the photoresist, which weakens the resist layer and results in destruction of the photoresist master when the two layers are separated. Avoid curing for more than 2 h. - 2. Silanization of the resist master (Steps 6 and 7) might have failed. This will result in strong binding of the cured PDMS to the master. Before making a new master, check on a blank one that the silane used for the coating is still functional. Silanes tend to degrade, and the silane solution should be renewed regularly. - **Problem**: Salt crystals form on the surface of the elastomeric stamp as the PBS dries. **[Step 19]** - **Solution**: This may happen if an excess of PBS is left to dry on the stamp. Avoid this by washing the stamp once with H 2 O before drying. - **Problem**: The polystyrene layer detaches and floats at the surface when the coverslip is placed in aqueous solution. **[Step 22]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Treat the coverslip with adhesion promoter (Step 14) prior to applying the polystyrene. - 2. Affix the polystyrene to the coverslip by placing the polystyrene-coated coverslip under a UV lamp for 5 min at λ = 185 nm and 4 × 60 W (Yan and Harnish 2003). - **Problem**: Cells do not grow uniformly and/or they grow significantly beyond the boundaries of the microfeatures. **[Step 33]** - **Solution**: Consider the following when stamping the substrate in Step 20 : - 1. Insufficient pressure might result in poor printing. Apply pressure with the tweezers both uniformly and for a longer period of time. - 2. Excessive pressure will induce sagging of the stamp, causing proteins to print outside of the features. Apply pressure more gently. - 3. Do not move the stamp once it has touched the surface. Both application and removal of the stamp should be done with precision and great care. ### DISCUSSION Microfabrication techniques as applied to cell biology now have a long and successful history (see Folch and Toner [2000] and Whitesides et al. [2001] for reviews of many micropatterning techniques developed from the 1970 s to the 1990 s). Accompanying the rapid development of biological applications (in cell biology, tissue engineering, cell co-cultures, bioassays, and biosensors, among other fields), there has been a huge burst of technical papers in the last 10 years that expand the utility of micropatterning techniques to new substrates (glass, plastics, hydrogels, and elastomers), additional molecules, cell types, and into three dimensions. There are many alternative techniques, but five main processes dominate the field of micropatterning: 1. Photolithography and lift-off (as well as other stencil-type methods) - Laser/electron beam etching - Micro- and nanoprinting - UV-based chemistry - Microcontact printing Each method has drawbacks and advantages, so that the method chosen will depend upon the application.
