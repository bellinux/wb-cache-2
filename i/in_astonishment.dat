5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on <b>in</b> <b>astonishment</b> as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E
25|$|Fritz hides in {{an alley}} where his older fox girlfriend, Winston Schwartz, finds him and drags him on a road trip to San Francisco. When the car runs out of gas {{in the middle of}} the desert, he decides to abandon her. He later meets up with Blue, a heroin-addicted rabbit biker. Along with Blue's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an {{underground}} hide-out where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a power station. When Harriet tries to get Blue to leave with her to go to a restaurant, he hits her several times and ties her down with a chain. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with a candle by a member of the group. Blue and the other revolutionaries then gang-rape her. After setting the dynamite at the power plant, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart, and unsuccessfully attempts to remove it before being caught in the explosion. At a Los Angeles hospital, Harriet (disguised as a nun) and the girls from the New York park come to comfort him in what they believe to be his last moments. Fritz, after reciting the speech he used to pick up the girls from New York, becomes revitalized and has sex with the trio of girls while Harriet watches <b>in</b> <b>astonishment.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose <b>in</b> <b>astonishment.</b> The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure {{what happened to her}} arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what {{do you think of}} the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed <b>in</b> <b>astonishment.</b> Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time! ...|$|E
500|$|Orr is {{also well}} known for his {{charitable}} works, although he kept mention of {{them out of the}} press. Former Eagle-Tribune writer Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children's Hospital, with a box of programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: [...] "We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed <b>in</b> <b>astonishment</b> and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E

500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour <b>in</b> <b>astonishment.</b> [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E

She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter <b>in</b> <b>astonishment</b> and make bird-like courting sounds at each other.

2500|$|The Mermaid of Zennor (1900, watercolour), {{also known}} as The Mermaid Discovered, {{features}} a man wearing renaissance garb, standing on a flight of stone stairs leading down to the water, and staring <b>in</b> <b>astonishment</b> at the young woman draped across the stones at the base. [...] Her hair is red, and she is unclad from the waist up; {{from the waist down}} she has pink fins. [...] The picture alludes to the legend of the Mermaid of Zennor who lives at Pendour Cove, near the Cornish village of Zennor.|$|E
2500|$|The short poems which {{sometimes}} precede his responsa also show great poetic talent and a pure Hebrew style (see Bacher in Monatsschrift, xliv.56 et seq.). When Abraham ibn Ezra was traveling through France R. Tam greeted him in verse, whereupon Ibn Ezra exclaimed <b>in</b> <b>astonishment,</b> [...] "Who has admitted the French into {{the temple of}} poetry?" [...] (Kerem Ḥemed, vii.35). Another work of his in metric form is his poem on the accents, which contains forty-five strophes riming in; it is found in various libraries (Padua, Hamburg, Parma), and is entitled Maḥberet. Luzzatto has given the first four strophes in Kerem Ḥemed (vii.38), and Halberstam has printed the whole poem in Kobak's [...] "Jeschurun" [...] (v.123).|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah related {{that a woman}} once came to Rabbi Akiva {{and told}} him that she had {{observed}} a bloodstain. He asked her whether she perhaps had a wound. She replied that she had a wound, but it had healed. He asked whether it was possible that it could open again and bleed. She answered in the affirmative, and Rabbi Akiva declared her clean. Observing that his disciples looked at each other <b>in</b> <b>astonishment,</b> he told them that the Sages did not lay down the rule for bloodstains to create a strict result but rather to produce a lenient result, for [...] says, [...] "If a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood" [...] — only blood, not a bloodstain.|$|E

2500|$|During the journey, {{the fleet}} visited the Pulau Sembilan in the Strait of Malacca {{in the seventh}} year of the Yongle reign (1409), {{according}} to Fei Xin. He stated that the troops were sent there to cut wood. Dreyer (2007) concluded that the stop was during the return journey as the treasure fleet did not leave the Chinese coast for the third voyage until early 1410. Fei Xin's written words were: [...] "In the seventh year of Yongle, Zheng He and his associates sent government troops onto the island to cut incense. They obtained six logs, each eight or nine chi in diameter and six or seven zhang in length, whose aroma was pure and far-ranging. The pattern [...] was black, with fine lines. The people of the island opened their eyes wide and stuck out their tongues <b>in</b> <b>astonishment,</b> and were told that 'We are the soldiers of the Heavenly Court, and our awe-inspiring power is {{like that of the}} gods.'" [...] The treasure fleet arrived back in Nanjing in the summer of 1409.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{scenes from}} the Gospels are the Noli me tangere, where Mary Magdalen {{mistakes}} Christ for a gardener, the scene of Doubting Thomas, and the Meal at Emmaus, the first post-Resurrection scene in the Gospel of Luke. [...] The famous Romanesque reliefs of c. 1100 in the cloister of the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos devote large panels to both the Doubting Thomas scene, enacted with not only all the Apostles present, but also St Paul, and the Meeting on the Road to Emmaus. These two scenes, preceded by a Crucifixion and Deposition and followed by a Pentecost and Ascension, are the only large panels in the Romanesque phase of work. Occasionally other scenes are shown; in the Gospel of John (John: 20,3–10) {{he is the first}} to check that the tomb is empty. A capital in Toulouse shows the empty tomb with John peering in from behind a column, and raising his hand <b>in</b> <b>astonishment.</b> The Resurrection was also referred to by showing typological parallels, such as Jonah and the Whale (which was supported by Matthew [...] and Luke [...] ), the Resurrection of Lazarus, and other Old Testament episodes.|$|E
2500|$|An Antislavery {{meeting was}} held at Broadway Hall, in Broadway, above Howard Street, next to the famous Tattersalls.

Among other noted speakers Mr Garrison was present; while the exercises were progressing, an onslaught was made upon the meeting by the [...] "plug-uglies," [...] and other ruffians, sworn to exterminate the Abolition fanatics. Armed with sticks and clubs, and with a furious noise, they rushed upon the terrified audience, aiming particularly, however, at the rostrum and the speakers. Mr Garrison was safely got away {{through one of the}} side windows. George Bourne stood forth to receive the [...] "Tammany Braves," [...] and placing his cane before him with hands extended he said, [...] "Stand back, ye villains! What do you want here? Stand back I say!" [...] The leaders and the advancing band stood still for a moment <b>in</b> <b>astonishment</b> and mute admiration of the courage of the burly looking [...] "dominie," [...] whose splendid physique and fearless eye showed them an undaunted foe. At last one of them swung his hat and cried out [...] "Three cheers for the dominie!" [...] which they gave with a will, and leaving him unmolested, they chased out the remainder of the audience, who were glad to escape without personal violence.|$|E
