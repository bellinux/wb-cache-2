40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Since the 1990 s, {{researchers}} {{around the}} world have been creating antineutrino detectors for monitoring power reactors. These detectors have been deployed at light water reactors and are able to determine power levels and burn up throughout a fuel cycle. This technology could allow the IAEA to monitor LWRs remotely and unobtrusively to determine if they are operating using normal parameters. Very soon, the next generation of detector will be deployed at a CANDU reactor for a trial operation. While physical observation of these detectors is necessaryl in determining their usefulness, reactor physics simulations have proven to be very accurate in their prediction of detector performance. Since there are many designs still in development, reactor physics simulations are the only way to determine the efficacy of the detector technology. In addition to this, reactor simulations are the best way to evaluate the detector technology to ascertain its usefulness during diversion scenarios. In this research, antineutrino source terms were calculated for a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor core. These source terms were a function of power level and <b>initial</b> <b>enrichment.</b> SCALE 6. 1, developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was used to calculate the isotopic inventory in the core as a function of depletion. These fertile and fissile isotopics, along with the fission cross-section and number of antineutrinos emitted per fission, were used to predict the antineutrino source rate for the core. It was found that changing the power yields a linear response from the antineutrino source term. By increasing the power by five percent, the source term also increased by five percent. Substantial changes in the <b>initial</b> <b>enrichment</b> also lead to a detectable change in the antineutrino source term...|$|E
40|$|Summary. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability and approximation properties of enriched meshfree methods. In particular we focus on the particle-partition of unity method (PPUM) yet the presented results hold for any partition of unity based enrichment scheme. The goal of our enrichment scheme is to recover the optimal convergence rate of the uniform h-version independent of the regularity of the solution. Hence, we employ enrichment not only for modeling purposes but rather to improve the approximation properties of the numerical scheme. To this end we enrich our PPUM function space in an enrichment zone hierarchically near the singularities of the solution. This <b>initial</b> <b>enrichment</b> however can lead to a severe ill-conditioning and can compromise the stability of the discretization. To overcome the ill-conditioning of the enriched shape functions we present an appropriate local preconditioner which yields a stable and optimally conditioned basis independent of the employed <b>initial</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The construction of this preconditioner is of linear complexity with respect to the number of discretization points. We obtain optimal error bounds for an enriched PPUM discretization with local preconditioning that are independent of the regularity of the solution globally and within the employed enrichment zone we attain a kind of super-convergence. The results of our numerical experiments clearly show that our enriched PPUM with local preconditioning recovers the optimal convergence rate of O(h p) of the uniform h-version globally. For the considered model problems from linear elastic fracture mechanics we obtain an improved convergence rate of O(h p+δ) with δ ≥ 1 2 for p = 1. The condition number of the stiffness matrix is independent of the employed enrichment zone.

40|$|Determining as {{accurate}} as possible spent nuclear fuel isotopic content is gaining importance due to its safety and economic implications. Since nowadays higher burn ups are achievable through increasing <b>initial</b> <b>enrichments,</b> more efficient burn up strategies within the reactor cores and the extension of the irradiation periods, establishing and improving computation methodologies is mandatory in order to carry out reliable criticality and isotopic prediction calculations. Several codes (WIMSD 5, SERPENT 1. 1. 7, SCALE 6. 0, MONTEBURNS 2. 0 and MCNP-ACAB) and methodologies are tested here and compared to consolidated benchmarks (OECD/NEA pin cell moderated with light water) with the purpose of validating them and reviewing the state of the isotopic prediction capabilities. These preliminary comparisons will suggest what can be generally expected of these codes when applied to real problems. In the present paper, SCALE 6. 0 and MONTEBURNS 2. 0 are used to model the same reported geometries, material compositions and burn up history of the Spanish Van de llós II reactor cycles 7 - 11 and to reproduce measured isotopies after irradiation and decay times. We analyze comparisons between measurements and each code results for several grades of geometrical modelization detail, using different libraries and cross-section treatment methodologies. The power and flux normalization method implemented in MONTEBURNS 2. 0 is discussed and a new normalization strategy is developed to deal with the selected and similar problems, further options are included to reproduce temperature distributions of the materials within the fuel assemblies and it is introduced a new code to automate series of simulations and manage material information between them.

40|$|At the Atucha-I {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactor in Argentina, fuel assemblies in {{the spent fuel}} pools are stored by suspending them in two vertically stacked layers. This introduces the unique problem of verifying the presence of fuel in either layer without physically moving the fuel assemblies. Movement of fuel, especially from the lower layer, would involve a major {{effort on the part}} of the operator. Given that the facility uses both natural uranium and slightly enriched uranium at 0. 85 w% {sup 235 }U, and has been in operation since 1974, a wide range of burnups and cooling times can exist in any given pool. Additionally, while fuel assemblies are grouped together in a uniform fashion, the packing density from group to group can vary within a single pool. A tool called the Spent Fuel Neutron Counter (SFNC) was developed and successfully tested at the site to verify, in an in-situ condition, the presence of fuel up to burnups of 8, 000 MWd/t. Since the neutron source term becomes a nonlinear function of burnup beyond this burnup, a new algorithm was developed to predict expected response from the SFNC at measurement locations covering the entire range of burnups, cooling times, and <b>initial</b> <b>enrichments.</b> With the aid of a static database of parameters including intrinsic sources and energy group-wise detector response functions, as well as explicit spent fuel information including burnups, cooling times, enrichment types, and spacing between fuel assemblies, an expected response for any given location can be calculated by summing the contributions from the relevant neighboring fuel assemblies. Thus, the new algorithm maps the expected responses across the various pools providing inspectors with a visual aid in verifying the presence of the spent fuel assemblies. This algorithm has been fully integrated into a standalone application built in LabVIEW. The GUI uses a step-by-step approach to allow the end-user to first calibrate the predicted database against a set of measurements with SFNC at selected locations where spent fuel is present. Once the database is calibrated it can be used to detect gross defects by comparing the measured signal to the one predicted by the database with differences beyond a set tolerance indicating missing fuel...|$|R

A large number of both integral and peripheral membrane protein subunits from mitochondrial membrane protein complexes were identified in the detergent phase. We suggest that the optimized solubilization protocol in combination with detergent/polymer two-phase partitioning is a mild and efficient method for <b>initial</b> <b>enrichment</b> of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes in proteomic studies.

40|$|A molecular-based {{detection}} method {{was developed to}} detect Escherichia coli O 26, O 111 and O 157 in minced (ground) beef samples. This method consists of an <b>initial</b> overnight <b>enrichment</b> in modified tryptone soya broth (mTSB) and novobiocin prior to DNA extraction and subsequent serogrouping using a triplex PCR. This method has a low limit of detection and results are available within 24 hours of receipt of samples. Once optimized, this rapid method was utilized to determine the prevalence of these E. coli serogroups in six hundred minced beef samples {{all of which were}} previously examined by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and selective plating for E. coli O 26 and O 111. Using IMS, two E. coli O 26 isolates were detected. No E. coli O 111 were recovered. The multiplex PCR technique described here did not detect E. coli O 111 nor O 157 in any of the samples, however six minced beef samples were positive for E. coli O 26 using our method, only two of these were previously detected by IMS and culture. Application of molecular methods are useful to support culture-based approaches thereby further contributing to risk reduction along the food chain...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study {{isothermal}} oxidation {{of laser}} welded FeCrAl-RE samples containing specific fractions of seams in a bead-on-plate configuration at approximately 900 °C using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission {{scanning electron microscope}} (FEG-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques. An important reduction in the alumina-growth rate over the fusion zone compared to the base material occurs at 900 °C, thereby, suppressing the discontinuous increase in mass gain commonly observed for alumina-forming alloys when the temperature decreases from 1000 °C to 900 °C. This phenomenon is mainly related to the concomitant dramatic chromium carbide precipitation at the fusion zone/oxide film interface and possible earlier injection of the rare earth elements into the oxide layer. On one hand, chromium carbide precipitation, which {{is linked to the}} laser melting-induced high free carbon, contributes to improve the effectiveness of the diffusion barrier provided by the thermally growing scale. On the other hand, due to their <b>initial</b> high <b>enrichment</b> at the fusion zone surfaces, rare earth elements can penetrate in the oxide layer and promote the elimination of detrimental phase transformation of metastable platelets (γ,θ-Al 2 O 3) to α-Al 2 O 3 during the initial stages of oxidation...|$|R
40|$|An RDD {{attack against}} the U. S. is {{something}} America needs to prepare against. If such an event occurs the ability to quickly identify {{the source of the}} radiological material used in an RDD would aid investigators in identifying the perpetrators. Spent fuel {{is one of the most}} dangerous possible radiological sources for an RDD. In this work, a forensics methodology was developed and implemented to attribute spent fuel to a source reactor. The specific attributes determined are the spent fuel burnup, age from discharge, reactor type, and <b>initial</b> fuel <b>enrichment.</b> It is shown that by analyzing the post-event material, these attributes can be determined with enough accuracy to be useful for investigators. The burnup can be found within a 5 % accuracy, enrichment with a 2 % accuracy, and age with a 10 % accuracy. Reactor type can be determined if specific nuclides are measured. The methodology developed was implemented into a code call NEMASYS. NEMASYS is easy to use and it takes a minimum amount of time to learn its basic functions. It will process data within a few minutes and provide detailed information about the results and conclusions. i...|$|R
