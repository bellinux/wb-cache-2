40|$|I T {{is not too}} {{uncommon}} {{to find in the}} literature cases first diagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome that eventually prove to be porphyria. This con-tingency usually occurs when an alert observer notices the dark urine character-istic of porphyria, or when, in spite of a normally colored urine, the symp-tomatology makes one suspicious and, on examining the urine, one finds the pathognomonic porphyrins or precursors. Although in the case herein reported porphobilinogen and uroporphyrin were found in the urine after a diagnosis of acute <b>infectious</b> <b>polyneuritis</b> had been made, it is held that acute <b>infectious</b> <b>polyneuritis</b> was the primary diagnosis, with the abnormal porphyrins repre-senting either a secondary change or a fortuitous finding. CASE REPORT A 14 year old white female entered The Brooklyn Hospital {{for the first time on}} March 20, 1958, complaining of weakness in her legs. Three weeks prior to ad-mission she had noticed a tingling sensation in her feet. Two weeks later she experi-enced the same sensation in her fingertips. This was followed by weakness in th...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{cases of}} <b>infectious</b> <b>polyneuritis</b> {{of a kind}} not {{previously}} reported in this country were observed in Los Angelesâ€”three of them in hospital personnel. The clinical features at onset were headache, fever, dizziness of peculiar order, weakness and aching muscles. Motor weakness then developed, more severe in the proximal muscle groups and more often in the lower extremity. Sensory changes were also present. In two cases, debility was so severe as to necessitate prolonged inactivity. The condition was observed in 13 females (one a child) and one man. The age range was 10 to 65 years...|$|E
40|$|Histopathological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on five fatal cases of a type of polyneuritis of unknown etiology diagnosed as Landry-Guillain-Barre syndrome, which endemically occurred in children in the regions surrounding the Inland Sea of Japan. The most characteristic pathologic feature in the nervous system was pronounced patchy degenerative changes with slight or moderate degree of inflammatory cell response of focal type in the peripheral and cranial nerves, predominantly in the nerve fibers of the spinal and cranial roots. In the spinal cord, medulla, pons, and in some portions of the cerebrum and cerebellum, engorgement of the small blood vessels as well as edema and the less predominant scattered degenerative changes of ganglioncells and nerve fibers with extremely slight degree of glial response and sparse perivascular cell collections were encountered. The cerebrospinal meninges displayed edema and congestion of the pial blood vessels with focal collections of {{a small number of}} lymphocytes and/or monocytes. No advanced involvement of the anterior horn of the spinal cord in a strict sense of anterior poliomyelitis was, however, recognized. These changes may lead the histopathologic diagnosis of the present disease to infectious encephalomyelo-polyradiculoneuritis or a type of <b>infectious</b> <b>polyneuritis.</b> The main histopathologic changes in the visceral organs were a moderate degree of engorgement of the small blood vessels, degeneration of parencymatous organs such as the liver and kidney, hyperplasia or follicular atrophy of the lymphatic tissues, interalveolar pneumonia, focal myositis, and slight degree of round cell infiltrations in the interstitial tissues of the other viscera, such as the liver, heart, and gastrointestinal canal. Based upon the observations on the histopathological changes as well as clinical manifestations, discussions were made on the pathogenesis and etiologic factor of the present endemic disease with critique on the literatures. </p...|$|E
