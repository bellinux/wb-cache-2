5|$|Starting in April 2012, Iran's {{consumers}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> {{with a wave}} {{of rising}} prices that has now touched laundry detergent and food items such as cooking oil, rice, eggs and dairy products. Since April 2012, the price of food and other consumer products have risen between 10 and 20% in some cases.|$|E
5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and the targets were approved randomly – even illogically. The North's airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> first in the campaign, were also off-limits.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> in the lower limbs only.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for {{an hour before the}} Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E

Large swathes of the population <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> as food prices, and particularly the price of bread, have doubled {{over the last several}} months as a result of producers exploiting a shortage that has existed since 2006.|$|E
25|$|Habitat {{destruction}} and other causes {{have reduced the}} wild stocks of several cyprinids to dangerously low levels; some are already entirely extinct. In particular, the cyprinids of the subfamily Leuciscinae from southwestern North America <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> hard by pollution and unsustainable water use {{in the early to}} mid-20th century; most globally extinct cypriniform species are in fact leuciscinid cyprinids from the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Various Panamanian {{versions}} blame all Panamanian deaths on U.S. forces, {{though those}} {{who died in the}} Pan American Airlines building fire can not reasonably be said to have died at the hands of American forces. Some Panamanians may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by bullets fired by Panamanians but intended for American targets. A definitive accounting of all deaths in the events of January 1964 has yet to be published, and may never be published.|$|E
25|$|The Wairarapa Connection {{has been}} {{involved}} in several accidents. Most have occurred at level crossings, where road vehicles have passed warning signs or signals and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by the train. There are 28 public level crossings between Rimutaka tunnel and Masterton, of which three are controlled by alarms and barrier arms, 19 by alarms only, and six by signs only. Between Wellington and the Rimutaka tunnel there are four, all controlled by alarms and barrier arms.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, the zoo took in two {{bald eagles}} that were rescued in Wyoming. The 5-year-old male {{was found in}} 2008 and was {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by a car. The 3-year-old female was {{believed to have been}} injured during a storm. The birds were taken in by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey for evaluation and care, where it was decided they were unable to survive in the wild.|$|E

25|$|The CAP has {{furthermore}} been criticised due to {{its effect}} on farmland bird populations. Between 1980 and 2009, the farmland bird population has decreased from 600 million to 300 million, implying a loss of 50%. Among the species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> hardest are the starling and the tree sparrow, which have both declines by 53%. The removal of hedgerows and ploughing over meadows are two significant factors that {{may have contributed to}} more efficient farming, but that also caused a decrease in farmland birds' habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} {{proliferation of}} MANPADS {{has resulted in}} many being available to non-state groups on the international arms black market, sometimes {{for as little as}} US$5,000 each. This has resulted in a marked increase of MANPADS attacks on commercial airliners, including the failed 2002 Mombasa airliner attack, the 2003 Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident and the 2007 Mogadishu TransAVIAexport Airlines Il-76 crash. According to the U.S. State Department, over 40 civilian aircraft <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> with MANPADS since 1970, with about 400 passengers and crewmembers killed. Of these, six were airliners.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deaths of}} the Troubles {{occurred}} in July 1969. Francis McCloskey, a 67-year-old Catholic civilian had been found unconscious on 13 July near the Dungiven Orange Hall following a police baton charge against a crowd who had been throwing stones at the hall. Witnesses later said they had seen police batoning a figure in the doorway where McCloskey was found, although police claimed {{that he had been}} unconscious before the baton charge and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> with a stone. He was taken to hospital and died the following day.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, UK {{universities}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by considerable funding cuts as part {{of government}} austerity measures. This, in part, {{has led to an}} increase in the rental of student accommodation during the winter, spring, and summer vacation periods to house conference delegates and tourists, often at rates similar to those charged by upmarket hotels. Unfortunately, this often means that students are forced to vacate their rooms up to three times per year. As a result, several student-focussed personal storage and shipping companies have come into existence that cater to this need.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{figures of}} German losses remain unknown, but are now often {{estimated}} to be in range of 200 to 300 killed and wounded or sometimes more. Some of them might actually <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by friendly fire, in particular from the battleship, which was initially anchored too close to its target. Polish casualties were much lower, including 15 to 20 killed and 53 wounded. There is a controversy regarding the burial site discovered in 1940, containing the bodies of five unidentified Polish soldiers who were possibly executed by their comrades for attempted desertion. Eight of the prisoners of war are also {{said to have been}} tortured, and did not survive German captivity.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon's {{civilian}} infrastructure {{has also}} been targeted by the IDF. The international highway between Beirut and Damascus, and bridges, roads, airports, and factories have been bombed several times by the Israeli Air Force. This {{has led to the}} disruption of normal life in the country and difficulties in distributing civilian goods. The Rafik Hariri International Airport was among the first of many targets of Israel’s campaign in Lebanon. Civilian areas also bore a huge brunt and {{have been the subject of}} constant Israeli bombardment. Beirut's southern suburbs, traditionally a Hezbollah stronghold, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> numerous times by the IDF and many of its residents have fled. Israel warned Lebanese civilians of Hezbollah strongholds to evacuate their cities ahead of time through leaflets, though there is some debate over the legality and effectiveness of the warnings.|$|E
