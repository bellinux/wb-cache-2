5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Billy {{defeated}} Coe at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, but {{was still}} out of the medals in fifth place. The last major outing of Billy's career was the 1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from his best form, being eliminated in the heats {{with a time of}} 1:49.09 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in the {{elections}} of that year Miari and Peled were elected to the Knesset. Peled's parliamentary term coincided with the tense atmosphere of {{the outbreak of the}} First Intifada. However, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from confining himself to the hotly controversial issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, taking great interest in a great spectrum of subjects, on some of which he found common ground with staunch right-wingers.|$|E

25|$|A {{report of}} Gage's {{physical}} and mental condition {{shortly before his death}} implies that his most serious mental changes were temporary, so that in later life <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more functional, and socially far better adapted, than in the years immediately following his accident. A social recovery hypothesis suggests that Gage's work as a stagecoach driver in Chile fostered this recovery by providing daily structure which allowed him to regain lost social and personal skills.|$|E
25|$|At dawn, a fog {{obscured}} the frigates from each other, and Bouvet could not engage. The next morning, Aréthuse found herself {{alone on the}} sea, and Bouvet followed the course that he assumed Amelia had taken; around eleven, she appeared on the horizon and Aréthuse put on all sails to give chase. The frigates raced all day and at 19:30, Irby decided that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> enough to avoid interference from Rubis, and Amelia turned to confront her opponent.|$|E
25|$|Originally, a master's mate was an {{experienced}} petty officer, who assisted the master, {{but was not}} in line for promotion to lieutenant. By the mid-eighteenth century, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> {{more likely to be}} a superior midshipman, still waiting to pass his examination for lieutenant or to receive his commission, but taking rather more responsibility aboard ship. Six master's mates were allowed on a first rate, three on a third rate, and two on most frigates.|$|E

25|$|Instead of slowing, George {{kept the}} pace, and Cummings {{struggled}} to keep up. Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave up and started to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|E
25|$|Weill, {{shortly after}} graduating from Cornell University, got his first job on Wall Street in 1955 – as a runner for Bear Stearns. In 1956, he became a {{licensed}} broker at Bear Stearns. Rather than making phone calls or personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more comfortable sitting at his desk, poring through companies' financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until Joan persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Domnall and Adam, the Meic Uilleim {{disappear}} for some years. In their place, Harald Maddadsson, Earl of Orkney, becomes the chief threat to the tenuous authority of King William in northern Scotland. However, in 1211, Gofraid (or Guthred), son of Domnall, came from Ireland to Ross, and raised a rebellion. King William led a great army north, but failed to bring Gofraid to decisive battle. Late in the year King William returned south, leaving Maol Choluim, Mormaer of Fife, as his lieutenant in Moray. Gofraid soon afterwards captured a royal castle, showing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from being defeated.|$|E

25|$|Furius Victorinus, {{one of the}} two praetorian prefects, {{was sent}} with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, Marcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and Marcus Iallius Bassus, and a {{detachment}} of the Praetorian Guard. Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more qualified than his praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius' mistress Galeria Lysistrate. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real access to senatorial circleshis was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the Guard, Victorinus was the clear choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in Hungary took {{a sharp turn}} for the worse immediately after the celebrated victory over the Turks. The victorious commanders, including János Hunyadi, died of plague, Ulrich of Celje was murdered, and even the young King Ladislaus died suddenly the following year. The aged Đurađ Branković also died, his despotate passing to his son Lazar. Realizing that Hungary was drastically weakened and that he had crossed {{the point of no return}} by refusing the Sultan's demands, Thomas decided to step forward to head the Christian coalition. In August 1456, Ragusa received an information from the King in the utmost secrecy: he was intent on declaring war on the Turks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from capable of succeeding, and even suffered a Turkish raid in the beginning of 1457.|$|E
25|$|But {{this time}} on the {{frontier}} was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... {{some of which were}} written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.|$|E

25|$|Abas I's reign was {{characterized}} {{with an unusual}} period of stability and prosperity that Armenia had not enjoyed for decades. His capital was based at the fortress-city of Kars and Abas achieved numerous successes on both the foreign and domestic fronts. In {{the same year that}} he became king, Abas traveled to Dvin, where he was able to convince the Arab governor there to release several Armenian hostages and turn over control of the pontifical palace back to Armenia. Conflict between the Arabs were minimal too, {{with the exception of a}} military defeat Abas suffered near the city of Vagharshapat. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> less conciliatory towards the Byzantines, who had repeatedly demonstrated their unreliability as allies by attacking and annexing Armenian territories. Fortunately for him, Romanus of Byzantium was more focused on fighting the Arab Hamdanids, leaving Abas virtually free to conduct his policies without foreign hindrance.|$|E
25|$|Born in Kohoku ward, he {{came from}} a poor peasant family, and he entered local sumo tournaments to provide for them. He was scouted by the former Ryōgoku Yūjirō, who persuaded him to join Dewanoumi stable. Musashiyama made his {{professional}} debut in January 1926. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> superior to his early opponents, becoming an elite sekitori at the age of just 19. He reached the top makuuchi division in May 1929, and was runner-up in his second makuuchi tournament. He reached the san'yaku ranks at komusubi in May 1930. His rapid rise was considered miraculous in an era when it was not unusual for new recruits to take several years to even progress from the lowest jonokuchi division. He missed out on the yūshō or tournament championship in March 1931 only because he was of a lower rank than Tamanishiki, who finished with the same score. (There was no playoff system until 1947). However, he won what was to be his only top division championship the next tournament in May 1931.|$|E
25|$|Gower was {{retained}} for the 1976 season, however, {{playing in}} a total of seven first-class matches.

In one day cricket, he played another eight matches, scoring 188 runs at 23.50 however failing to reach fifty, falling short on one occasion with a season-best of 48. The 1977 season saw Gower play 25 matches, with another career best of 144*, his only century of the season. He amassed 745 runs at 23.28, with three other half centuries. In the one day format <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more prolific, he played 24 matches, scoring 867 with a best of 135*, one of two hundreds that year, along with four fifties, all at 48.16. After two first-class matches against Sri Lankan domestic teams over the winter of 1977–78, in which he scored 76 runs at 38.00 in first-class and a score of 22 in the only one day fixture, Gower topped 1,000 runs in a season {{for the first time in}} his career, scoring 1098 runs at 37.86 including two hundreds, five fifties and a call up to the national team.|$|E
