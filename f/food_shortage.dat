2500|$|Ashton, et al. {{write that}} {{policies}} leading to <b>food</b> <b>shortages,</b> natural disasters, and a slow response to initial indications of <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> were {{to blame for}} the famine. Policies leading to <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> included the implementation of the commune system and an emphasis on non-agricultural activities such as backyard steel production. Natural disasters included drought, flood, typhoon, plant disease, and insect pest. The slow response was in part {{due to a lack of}} objective reporting on the agricultural situation, including a [...] "nearly complete breakdown in the agricultural reporting system".|$|R

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies encounter a period of <b>food</b> <b>shortage,</b> more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because the P. rebeli caterpillars have a lower social rank in other ant species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, when some of the hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results in the P. rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two phases}} for P. rebeli {{complete}} {{integration into the}} Myrmica schencki ant colony: initial integration and full integration. In both stages of integration, the P. rebeli caterpillar is brought into the brood nest; however, in full integration, the P. rebeli also achieves its high social status within the host society. That status is crucial for surviving periods of host colony stress such as <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Most important, the British {{national}} output remained strong. Textiles {{and iron}} grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared—it was {{a golden age}} for agriculture even as <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate <b>food</b> <b>shortages.</b> [...] Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.|$|R

5|$|Despite the <b>food</b> <b>shortage,</b> more {{buildings}} were constructed. The Northern Commercial Company built a store to replace Barnette's cabin, and Wickersham recorded {{a wide range}} of businesses, including 500 houses and 1,200 people.

The vote passed, and Barnette was sworn in as the city's first mayor on the next day.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b> Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} three decades, <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> have created serious {{difficulties}} throughout the world. Developing countries in particular face the devastating effects of this brutal problem. Although there is agreement that a problem exists, controversy abounds on what causes <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> in developing countries. For some, the developing countries are responsible because their beliefs and socioeconomic institutions create obstacles to development. Others blame the developed countries for extracting natural resources from poor countries and placing other obstacles {{in the way of}} development. This study applies two widely used theories [...] modernization and dependency [...] to issues of <b>food</b> <b>shortages.</b> Internal and external factors related to <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> are examined in 89 developing countries. Of the eight independent variables in the study [...] number of tractors, gross national product, population growth, political stability, physical quality of life, external capital, colonization, and external debt [...] only the first two are related to calorie intake, however;Findings support modernization theory; the most important factors creating <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> in developing countries are internal [...] number of tractors and gross national product per capita. Potential external factors have no strong relationships with <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> in developing countries. However, in solving <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> in developing countries the two factors [...] internal and external [...] should be considered;Policy makers in developing countries should take practical steps to speed up this transitional stage to preconditions for the take-off stage. Local governments are encouraged to focus their attention on promoting the rural economy to lessen the effects of poverty in these areas. Rich countries are expected to help poor ones to reform their local institutions to meet the challenge of development. Finally, extension and research services are needed, with the help of local indigenous knowledge systems, to modernize farming systems in developing countries. Research is also needed on the effects of other internal factors such as population growth and poverty...|$|R

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Barnette's first {{action as}} mayor {{was to write}} a letter to Washington, D.C., asking the federal {{government}} to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b> This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds). Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city. In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand. In addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System, which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} months of 1941, British and Belgian colonial forces {{attacked}} Italian East Africa from the colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. By the end of March, they had seized the town of Gambela and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General Carlo De Simone and later General Pietro Gazzera. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b> In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrolling, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the South African Air Force put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.|$|E

5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with <b>food</b> <b>shortage,</b> a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E

Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, Samuil ruled it from 976 until 1004 when its governor Roman surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange of the titles of patrician and strategos. Later, Skopje was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to restore a Bulgarian state. At first in 1040 under Peter Delyan's command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, Skopje was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained in their hands until 1088. Skopje was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and <b>food</b> <b>shortage,</b> Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.|$|E
