5000|$|During {{the years}} of the World War II, Ambartsumian created a new theory of light {{diffusion}} in turbid media, based on invariance principle invention of his own. Using that mathematical tool Ambartsumian resolved a number of nonlinear problems of the light diffusion. The invariance principle formulated by Ambartsumian and various modifications of this principle presently are being widely used to solve extremely complicated problems in astrophysics, mathematical and theoretical physics, electronics, geophysics, atmospheric physics, and other areas of science. These problems and the associated mathematical apparatus are constantly becoming more complicated, but the basis is still Ambartsumian's invariance principle. In their book <b>Invariant</b> <b>Imbedding,</b> R.E. Bellman, R.E. Kalaba and M.C. Prestrud write that [...] "As a result of this pioneering work, new analytic treatments were made available and simplified computational solutions were obtained. These ideas were further developed and extensively generalized by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in a series of fundamental papers and in 1950 in his book... Many otherwise intractable problems were tamed, and great advances were made." [...] Ambartsumian, himself, held the invariance principle in special regard and always considered it to be one of his most successful and beloved creations. In 1946 for the creation of the theory of lights diffusion in turbid media Ambartsumian was awarded his first Stalins Prize.|$|E

It is shown that the finite difference approach to the solution of elliptic equations results in a special case of the coupled difference equations considered. For linear self-adjoint equations, the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> approach yields stable initial value problems. Finally, the standard direct and iterative finite difference methods are derived and analyzed from the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{relative}} efficiencies of the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> method {{with the traditional}} solution techniques of successive approximations (Picard method), linear algebraic equations, and Sokolov's method of averaging functional corrections in solving numerically two representatives of a class of Fredholm integral equations. The criterion of efficiency {{is the amount of}} computing time necessary to obtain the solution to a specified degree of accuracy. The results of this computational investigation indicate that <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> has definite numerical advantages; more information was obtained in the same length of time as with the other methods, or even in less time. The conclusion emphasized is that a routine application of <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> may be expected to be computationally competitive with, if not superior to, a routine application of other methods for the solution of some classes of Fredholm integral equations...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of papers devoted to the {{development}} of the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> theory of mode conversion in inhomogeneous plasmas. A new version of the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> theory of wave propagation in inhomogeneous media allows one to solve a wide variety of coupled wave equations exactly and efficiently, even in the cases where the material parameters change discontinuously at the boundaries and inside the inhomogeneous medium. In this paper, the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> method is applied to the mode conversion of the simplest kind, that is the conversion of $p$-polarized electromagnetic waves into electrostatic modes in cold, unmagnetized plasmas. The mode conversion coefficient and the field distribution are calculated exactly for linear and parabolic plasma density profiles and compared quantitatively with previous results.

40|$|<b>Invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> {{theory is}} an {{alternative}} formulation of particle transport theory. Although stochastic foundations of <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> have been known from the beginnings, the method itself has so far exclusively been used for calculating first moments, i. e. expectations. The present paper attempts {{to set up a}} probability balance equation in the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> approach from which equations for the first and second order densities are derived. It is shown that only the equations for the first order densities are non-linear, while subsequent order densities obey linear equations. This is expected to considerably simplify solution to those problems which involve second order density calculations where <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> techniques may be profitably used. Examples of such quantities are the variance or correlations between particles detected at two different energies or angles or the higher moments of the emitted multiplicity distribution such as the variance from a target bombarded by incident particles. One possible area of application of our equations is non-destructive estimation of fissile material by the active neutron assay technique. Another area is the study of particle cascade development in sputtering and positron backscattering from surfaces. The approach is illustrated by a simple forward–backward scattering model for these two problems...|$|E
40|$|We generalize the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> {{theory of}} the wave {{propagation}} and derive new <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations for the propagation of arbitrary number of coupled waves of any kind in arbitrarily-inhomogeneous stratified media, where the wave equations are effectively one-dimensional. By doing this, we transform the original boundary value problem of coupled second-order differential equations to an initial value problem of coupled first-order differential equations, which makes the numerical solution of the coupled wave equations much easier. Using the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations, {{we are able to}} calculate the matrix reflection and transmission coefficients and the wave amplitudes inside the inhomogeneous media exactly and efficiently. We establish the validity and the usefulness of our results by applying them to the propagation of circularly-polarized electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional photonic crystals made of isotropic chiral media. We find that there are three kinds of bandgaps in these structures and clarify the nature of these bandgaps by exact calculations. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, to appear in Europhys. Let...|$|E

The concepts of <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding,</b> scattering and projectors are given and then applied to the optimal control problem. It is shown that the scattering process is the general theory from which <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> method can be derived. The method of block diagonalization of matrices and the derivation of projectors is given for a general time-varying system. These two methods are applied to the optimal control problem where it is shown that the general algorithm follows directly from the procedures...|$|E
40|$|The <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> {{technique}} {{is applied to}} the problem of resonance line scattering with frequency redistribution. By applying the principles of invariance to the resonance line scattering problem a set of non-linear, integrodifferential equations for the scattering and transmission functions are derived. Thus, an alternate approach to the resonance line scattering problem is presented. Rather than solving for the specific intensity directly the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations may be solved for the scattering and transmission functions from which the specific intensity may be calculated. The {{technique is}} very general and in principle, can accommodate scattering in inhomogeneous atmospheres with arbitrary frequency redistribution and scattering phase functions. Solutions to the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations in some simple cases are presented. If the scattering is isotropic and completely noncoherent and the atmosphere may be modeled as homogeneous, the scattering and transmission functions may be expressed in terms of generalized H, X and Y functions. This technique is extended to the problems of coupled spectral lines and scattering of radiation from internal sources...|$|E
40|$|SIO Reference 57 - 45. The {{principle}} of <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding.</b> recently stated by Bellmr and Kalaba, is {{a rule of}} action which may be followed in the mathematical formulation of any of a wide class of problems concerned with transfer phenomena in general media. The statement of the principle generalizes the methodology originally developed by Ambarzumian and extended by Chandrasekhar in their studies of the transfer of radiation through scattering and absorbing media. In this note we exhibit an explicit analytic embodiment of the principle for radiative transfer and neutron transport processes. This symbolic statement of the principle - which we shall call the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> relation - yields in particular the general symmetric forms {{of the principles of}} invariance for these processes. The semi-group features which generally are associated with an invariantly imbedded process are also implicit in the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> relation. The present discussion will be limited to the steady state case on a class of inhomogeneous one-parameter carrier spaces (e. g., plane-parallel, cylindrical, spherical, and general one-parameter space filling families of surfaces) ...|$|E

The existence of inverses of certain matrices appearing in the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations and the stability of the algorithm are investigated. The minimal surface equation under various boundary conditions and the subsonic fluid flow problem are chosen as test examples for illustrating the method. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method can be used efficiently for solving elliptic problems of a highly nonlinear nature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> method {{considered}} {{is based}} on an equation which describes the change in the reflected radiation when an optically thin layer is added {{to the top of the}} atmosphere. The equation is used to treat the problem of reflection from a planetary atmosphere as an initial value problem. A fast method is discussed for the solution of the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equation. The speed and accuracy of the new method are illustrated by comparing it with the doubling program published by Hansen and Travis (1974).

We show that various available analytical and numerical results for reflection phase distributions in the Anderson- and <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> models {{are in good}} qualitative agreement, as expected from the above equivalence of these models. We also discuss the distribution of reflection phases and of reflection delay times for an Anderson model with a simple distribution of on-site potentials characterizing extreme strong disorder...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain an}} exact {{solution}} of the radiative-transfer equation in media where both absorption and scattering are significant, the usual approach {{is to use a}} numerical method. Three methods are known in the literature: <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding,</b> eigenvalue-eigenfunction, and matrix doubling. This paper examines the practical application of these methods to the problem of emission from an inhomogeneous (Rayleigh) layer, the effects of layer parameters on the stability. It is found that <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> is most suitable for computing emission from an inhomogeneous layer with a temperature profile but tends to be unstable as the optical thickness of the layer increases beyond 0. 5. On the other hand, the matrix-doubling method is stable for arbitrary optical thickness but is not suitable for handling multilayers. The eigenvalue-eigenfunction method is more stable than the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> as optical thickness increases up to 2. 0. It also permits temperature profile in the layer, but the computation is much more complicated. It is less stable than the matrix-doubling method when optical thickness is larger than 2. 0. In general, the choice of a method is dependent {{on the nature of the}} problem...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{a series}} of papers, we have applied <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> to provide new {{analytic}} and computational approaches {{to a variety of}} processes of mathematical physics. We began a detailed analysis of the ordinary and partial differential equations of <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding,</b> concentrating upon existence and uniqueness of solution, nonnegativity of solution, and convergence of associated difference algorithms as step-size went to zero. In this paper, we wish to show that for a quite general class of transport processes involving particle-particle interaction as well as the usual particle-medium interaction, we can obtain difference approximations which exhibit nonnegativity and boundedness in an immediate fashion. Furthermore, a uniform Lipschitz condition is preserved. In subsequent papers, we shall discuss the more difficult matters of convergence to the solution of the partial differential equation and existence of this solution over the entire physical range of the independent variables...|$|E

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} problem of the {{enhancement}} of tunnelling of a quantum particle induced by disorder of a one-dimensional tunnel barrier of length L, using two different approximate analytic solutions of the <b>invariant</b> <b>imbedding</b> equations of wave propagation for weak disorder. The two solutions are complementary for the detailed understanding of important aspects of numerical results on disorder-enhanced tunnelling obtained recently by Kim et al. (Phys. rev.

In particular, we derive analytically the scaled wavenumber (kL) -threshold where disorder-enhanced tunnelling of an incident electron first occurs, as well as the rate of variation of the transmittance in the limit of vanishing disorder. Both quantities are in good agreement with the numerical results of Kim et al.
