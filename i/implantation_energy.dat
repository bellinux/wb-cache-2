In this second part we compare the nitrogen distribution and electrical properties of ultrathin (25 - 30 Angstrom) oxides grown under the same oxidation conditions on very low (3 keV) and medium (25 keV) energy nitrogen-implantated silicon.

The properties of the dual implanted samples have been compared to Cr + or N 2 + implanted specimens. The microstructural and mechanical properties of the Ni plates depend on the penetration ranges of the Cr and N atomic profiles obtained after the implantation process. The increase of hardness reduced the coefficient of friction of the samples and the wear rates. Preferential formation of Cr-N over Ni-N compounds has been observed when the Cr and N atomic profiles coexist within the Ni matrix.
