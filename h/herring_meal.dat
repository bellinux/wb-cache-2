40|$|Fish <b>meals</b> (<b>herring,</b> menhaden, and anchovy), commercially {{available}} in Atlantic Canada and a Norwegian fish meal (Norse-LT 94 Reg.) formulated to contain 0, 16, 28 or 40 % protein were evaluated for protein quality by in vitro assays and by growth studies with Atlantic salmon fingerlings. Pepsin digestibility and multienzyme digestibility were useful in predicting protein quality. Assays for total volatile basic-nitrogen, available lysine, sulphydryl groups, and disulphide bonds, particularly when used alone, were of limited value. Atlantic salmon fingerlings (initial weight 7. 65 +or- 0. 14 g) fed on diets containing 2 steam-dried <b>herring</b> <b>meals</b> and Norse-LT 94 Reg. for 70 days were evaluated {{on the basis}} of weight gain, protein efficiency ratio, net protein ratio, net protein utilization, and slope assay. Fish fed Norse-LT 94 Reg. gained 11 - 60 % more weight than fish fed on the Canadian meals. The protein quality of the Canadian fish meals was lower than that of Norse-LT 94 Reg [...] Pepsin digestibility ranked the fish meals in the same order as the biological tests, but the biological testing of feedstuffs to determine protein quality is recommended as the final method of comparison. Biological evaluation is the preferred method of measuring the overall quality of a feedstuff, since in vitro tests may miss-rank the quality of some feedstuffs. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim was {{to compare}} {{postprandial}} lipid, insulin and vitamin D responses after consumption of three otherwise identical meals served either with baked herring, pickled herring or with baked, minced beef. METHODS: Seventeen healthy, overweight men (mean age 58 years, BMI 26. 4 - 29. 5 kg/m 2) consumed standardized lunches together with baked herring, pickled herring or baked, minced beef on three occasions in a crossover design. Blood samples were taken just before and up to 7 h after the meal. The postprandial response was measured as serum concentrations of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol and lipoproteins (LDL, HDL and VLDL), insulin, 25 -OH vitamin D and plasma fatty acid composition. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} postprandial lipid responses between the two <b>herring</b> <b>meals,</b> whereas a slower TG clearance was observed after the baked, minced beef meal. The 150 g servings of baked and pickled herring provided 3. 3 and 2. 8 g of long-chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA), respectively, which was reflected in a substantial postprandial increase in plasma LC n- 3 PUFA levels. The pickled herring contained 22 % sugar and consequently gave a higher insulin response compared with the other two meals. CONCLUSIONS: Both pickled and baked herring are good sources of LC n- 3 PUFA in the diet, but the presence of sugar in pickled herring should be taken into consideration, especially if large amounts are consumed. The faster postprandial TG clearance after a <b>meal</b> with baked <b>herring</b> compared with baked beef supports previous studies on the beneficial effects of herring on cardiovascular health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Apparent {{digestibility}} coefficients (ADCs) of dry matter, crude protein, crude lipid, energy, essential amino acids, and {{fatty acids}} in extruded pellets containing various fish meals were determined for olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Eight extruded pellet diets {{were prepared to}} contain different fish <b>meals</b> (<b>herring</b> fish <b>meal,</b> anchovy fish meal, mackerel fish meal, sardine fish meal-A, sardine fish meal-B, tuna fish meal, pollock fish meal-A, and pollock fish meal-B) designated as HM, AM, MM, SM-A, SM-B, TM, PM-A, and PM-B, respectively. Chromic oxide (Cr 2 O 3) {{was used as an}} inert indicator at a concentration of 0. 5  % in the diet. Feces were collected from triplicate groups of fish (151 [*]±[*] 4. 0  g) using a fecal collection column attached to the fish rearing tank for 4  weeks. Dry matter ADCs of the MM, SM-A, SM-B, and PM-A diets were higher than those of all the other dietary groups, and the lowest digestibility of dry matter was observed in the PM-B diet. Fish fed the MM, SM-A, and PM-A diets showed significantly higher ADC of protein than those fed the AM, SM-B, TM, and PM-B diets. Lipid ADC of PM-B was significantly lower than that of the other diets. Energy ADCs of fish fed the MM, SM-A, and PM-A diets were significantly higher than those of the other diets. The availability of essential amino acids in the MM, SM-A, and PM-A diets were generally higher than that of the other fish meal diets, while TM showed the lowest values among all the experimental diets. ADCs of fatty acids in the AM, MM, SM-A, and PM-A diets were generally higher than those of fatty acids in the other diets, and the lowest values were recorded for the PM-B diet. These results provide information on the bioavailability of nutrients and energy in various fish meals which can be used to properly formulate practical extruded feeds for olive flounder...|$|R

50|$|The House of Lords {{dismissed}} the section 13 concerns because the DMNA was a {{defect in the}} <b>herring</b> <b>meal,</b> and not a different ingredient. The problem, they found, was in the quality or condition of the ingredient, and not in its correct identification. The House of Lords also considered section 14(1), by which a buyer relying on the judgment or skill of a seller to provide goods for a particular purpose enters into an implicit contract that the goods are suitable for the purpose. In this case, the House affirmed that Ashington Piggeries was relying on its own expertise in determining what ingredients were appropriate, but relying on Christopher Hill to obtain suitable quality ingredients to complete the recipe. Since the potential toxicity of DMNA to all animals was known and since partial reliance on a seller’s skill and judgment qualified under 14(1), the defendant—who knew {{the purpose of the}} meal in animal feed—was responsible to provide quality ingredients that were not toxic to animals.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the following four markers; Vitamin B 12, selenium, vitamin D, and parvalbumin may be used as compliance markers for fish intake. Methods: Blood samples from a randomized cross-over herring intervention study (n= 32) were analyzed by HPLC and immunochemistry. The criteria were that plasma or serum concentrations of candidate compliance markers after the herring diet should increase significantly compared to starting concentrations. In addition, the reference meat diet should not yield an increase in plasma concentration of the candidate marker. Results: Vitamin B 12 and selenium met the set criteria for indicating a correlation between the marker and fish intake with significant increases in serum concentrations at 8. 9 % (p= 0. 008) and 4. 6 % (p= 0. 02) respectively after a 6 -week <b>herring</b> intervention (5 <b>meals</b> a week). Parvalbumin and 25 -hydroxy vitamin D 3 levels did not increase significantly during the herring interventions. Conclusions: Vitamin B 12 may be suitable as a compliance marker for fish intake.

6000|$|The new King Svein from Jomsburg, Knut's natural son, had {{no success}} in Norway, nor {{seems to have}} {{deserved}} any. His English mother and he {{were found to be}} grasping, oppressive persons; and awoke, almost from the instant that Olaf was suppressed and crushed away from Norway into Heaven, universal odium more and more in that country. Well-deservedly, as still appears; for their taxings and extortions of malt, of <b>herring,</b> of <b>meal,</b> smithwork and every article taxable in Norway, were extreme; and their service to the country otherwise nearly imperceptible. In brief their one basis there was the power of Knut the Great; and that, like all earthly things, was liable to sudden collapse,--and it suffered such in a notable degree. King Knut, hardly yet of middle age, and the greatest King in the then world, died at Shaftesbury, in 1035, as Dahlmann thinks [16],--leaving two legitimate sons and a busy, intriguing widow (Norman Emma, widow of Ethelred the Unready), mother of the younger of these two; neither of whom proved to have any talent or any continuance. In spite of Emma's utmost efforts, Harald, the elder son of Knut, not hers, got England for his kingdom; Emma and her Harda-Knut had to be content with Denmark, and go thither, much against their will. Harald in England,--light-going little figure like his father before him,--got the name of Harefoot here; and might have done good work among his now orderly and settled people; but he died almost within year and day; and has left no trace among us, except that of [...] "Harefoot," [...] from his swift mode of walking. Emma and her Harda-Knut now returned joyful to England. But the violent, idle, and drunken Harda-Knut did no good there; and, happily for England and him, soon suddenly ended, by stroke of apoplexy at a marriage festival, as mentioned above. In Denmark he had done still less good. And indeed,--under him, in a year or two, the grand imperial edifice, laboriously built by Knut's valor and wisdom, had already tumbled all to the ground, in a most unexpected and remarkable way. As we are now to indicate with all brevity.|$|R

Feed costs therefore {{has a major}} role in the economics of such enterprises. A linear programming model was developed to formulate least cost feeds for tilapia with protein levels of 30 % to 40 %. Feeds were formulated subject to limits imposed on their content of protein, fiber, fat, carbohydrates, metabolizable energy to protein ratio, lysine and sulfur amino acids, fish meal, and cottonseed meal. Data regardi~ feed ingredient composition and prices, nutrient requirements of tilapia and limits on the use of certain feed ingredients were obtained from secondary sources. Ingredients considered include: corn, cottonseed <b>meal,</b> soybean <b>meal,</b> <b>herring</b> fishmeal, oats, meat and bone meal, poultry by-product meal, sorghum, wheat, wheat bran, soybean seeds, and rice. Results indicated the importance of fishmeal, cottonseed meal, corn, poultry by-products, and soybean seeds and meal in feed formulation. Metabolizable energy to protein ratio proved to be the most binding constraint for diets with protein level higher than 39 %. The cost of feed ingredients was 867. 18 SRlton for the 30 % protein feed and increased with increasing dietary protein to reach 1, 494. 40 SRlton for the 39 % protein feed.

Pigs were blocked by weight with six replications of three treatments and 15 pigs per pen. During Phase I (d 0 to 7 postweaning), all pigs were fed the same high nutrient density diet. During Phase II (7 to 28 d postweaning), pigs were fed one of three experimental diets. All Phase II diets contained 10 % dried whey and were formulated to 1. 25 % lysine and. 34 % methionine.

Norse LT- 94 (<b>herring</b> <b>meal,</b> 4. 06 %) and select menhaden fish meal (4. 87 %) replaced blood meal on an equal lysine basis to form the other experimental diets. No differences occurred in pig performance during Phase II, indicating that Norse LT- 94, spray-dried blood meal, and select menhaden fish meal are interchangeable as protein sources when substituted on an equal lysine basis. In trial 2, 230 pigs (initially 18 d of age and 11. 0 lb) were {{used to examine the}} influence of various combinations of spray-dried porcine plasma and Norse LT- 94 on starter pig performance.

All Phase 1 diets were formulated to contain 20 % dried whey, 1. 5 % lysine, and. 44 % methionine. These diets were fed from d 0 to 14 postweaning. From d 14 to 28 (Phase II), all pigs were fed a common diet. Replacing spray-dried porcine plasma with Norse LT- 94 resulted in a linear decrease in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) during Phase I and for the overall trial. This response became magnified when greater than 25 % of the plasma was replaced with Norse LT- 94. Feed efficiency responded in a quadratic manner for the first week of Phase I and for the overall trial, with pigs fed the diet containing 6 % spray-dried porcine plasma and 2. 14 % Norse LT 94 having the best feed efficiency.

40|$|SUMMARY-Cattle {{were exposed}} to both {{commercial}} dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA) and <b>herring</b> <b>meal</b> in which DMNA developed during processing and storage. DMNA levels in fish meal were titrated by bioassay and compared with those obtained by analytic chemistry. Accumulation of DMNA started when the dosage exceeded a threshold value of 0. 1 mg DMNA/kg body weight. Signs of liver damage became apparent when the dosage was 12 - 26 mg DMNA/kg. If DMNA {{was removed from the}} diet, recovery from the liver damage occurred. Regeneration of liver tissue and neoformation of hepatic veins to replace those lost by obliteration were established. The vessel wall damage extended beyond the liver. The hepatic vein branches especially showed necrosis of the endothelium, edema, and bleeding in the vessel wall itself with subse...|$|E
40|$|Amino acid {{availability}} {{values for}} Atlantic salmon were evaluated for two steam- and one flame-dried <b>herring</b> <b>meal,</b> menhaden meal, anchovy meal, and a Norwegian capelin meal (Norse-LT 94 (R)). Apparent amino acid availabilities were calculated based on feces collected either by manual stripping or sedimentation (Guelph CYAQ- 2 digestibility system). Apparent crude protein availability values obtained from manually stripped feces showed that Norse-LT 948 (R) (87. 0 %) {{was not significantly}} different from any of the herring meals (82. 6 and 85. 1 %) tested but was higher (P < 0. 05) than from both the anchovy (76. 7 %) and menhaden meals (78. 2 %). Availabilities calculated with values from feces collected by sedimentation were approximately 9 % higher than those from manually stripped feces due to leaching of faecal constituents. The amino acid availability values of common feedstuffs should be used for feed formulation as their availability within a feed ingredient is quite variable...|$|E
40|$|The nutritive {{values of}} two fishery by-products, i. e. fish protein {{hydrolysate}} (FPH) and liquefied fish (LF), were studied. Three trials using Hubbard broilers, and Yorkshire pigs (starter and grower phase) were conducted. The FPH {{was used in}} the broiler trial and LF in the swine grower trial as supplemental protein sources, that replaced partially the soybean meal protein. The FPH was used to completely substitute for the skim milk component in milk replacer for the pig starter trial. Sensory evaluation of the edible tissue was conducted {{at the end of the}} broiler and swine grower trials to evaluate the carcass quality changes associated with feeding fish-containing diets. The FPH derived from four different substrates (Hake, Dover sole, Brown rock cod and Atlantic cod) were incorporated into diets to provide 5 % of the total dietary protein in the broiler trial and compared to <b>Herring</b> <b>meal</b> and soybean meal diets.

40|$|THE {{nutritive value}} of fish meal may decline {{following}} storage be-cause of oxidative changes affecting the lipid fraction and changes which are little understood affecting {{the availability of}} some of the amino acids in the protein fraction. The literature in this connection has been reviewed elsewhere (March, 1962). It has been found that treatment of fish meal with antioxidant retards oxida-tive changes (Meade, 1956; Aure, 1957; Lea et al., 1958; Flanzy et al., 1962) and protects against loss of nutritive value of the lipids during storage (Potter et al., 1961; March et al., 1962). March et al. (1961) found that whereas butylated hy-droxytoluene (BELT) stabilized the lipids in <b>herring</b> <b>meal</b> against oxidation, the pro-tein nutritive value of the treated and un-treated meals after storage was similar. Further investigation of the problem seemed warranted and in the following ex-periments the effects of treating herring meals with BHT or with l, 2 -dihydro- 6 -ethoxy- 2, 2, 4 -trimethylquinoline (EQ*) were studied with respect to the metabolizable energy and supplementary protein values of the meals...|$|E
40|$|BUTLER 1 {{found that}} almost no heating could be {{observed}} in <b>herring</b> <b>meal</b> packed in impregnated, airtight paper bags. The present paper reports from application of this method to meal produced from Norwegian summercaught herring. The fat of this herring has a relatively high iodine number (140 - 150), and the meal usually develop heat when stored in the commenly used 50 kg's paper bags made from 5 layers "craft-paper". The following types of bags were tried: Mark 1 A - 4 layers craft-paper - 1 layer asphalt. Mark 2 A - 3 layers craft-paper - 2 layers asphalt. Mark T - 3 layers craft-paper - 1 layer "thiocol". Mark V - 5 layers craft-paper. Both types of asphalt impregnated bags were found to give allmost complete prevention towards heat. The bag impregnated with "thiocol" -a polysulfide resine- could not prevent {{an increase in the}} temperature to the same level as that of meal packed in non-impregnated bags. Chemical analyses did not give any information as to changes taking place in the herring-meal during the period of heating. 1 C. BUTLER, Commercial Fish. Rev., 8, 1946...|$|E
