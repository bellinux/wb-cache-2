2500|$|Jerome Rothenberg (born 1931) is {{well known}} for his work in ethnopoetics, but he was also the coiner of the term [...] "deep image", which he used to {{describe}} the work of poets like Robert Kelly (born 1935), Diane Wakoski (born 1937) and Clayton Eshleman (born 1935). Deep Image poetry was inspired by the symbolist theory of correspondences, in particular the work of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca. The term was later taken up and popularized by Robert Bly. The Deep <b>Image</b> <b>movement</b> was also the most international, accompanied by a flood of new translations from Latin American and European poets such as Pablo Neruda, César Vallejo and Tomas Tranströmer. Some of the poets who became associated with Deep Image are Galway Kinnell, James Wright, Mark Strand and W. S. Merwin. Both Merwin and California poet Gary Snyder would also become known for their interest in environmental and ecological concerns.|$|E

50|$|Rotating {{panoramic}} cameras, {{also called}} slit scan or scanning cameras {{are capable of}} 360° or greater degree of rotation. A clockwork or motorized mechanism rotates the camera continuously and pulls the film through the camera, so {{the motion of the}} film matches that of the <b>image</b> <b>movement</b> across the image plane. Exposure is made through a narrow slit. The central part of the image field produces a very sharp picture that is consistent across the frame.|$|E
50|$|Another line of {{research}} suggests that defective eye movement caused by M cells {{is the cause of}} dyslexia. Since the magnocellular system is sensitive to <b>image</b> <b>movement,</b> and dyslexia is posited to be caused by abnormalities in M cells, dyslexics tend to focus on words longer, take shorter scans when reading, and stop more often per line. The study postulates that this is not caused by dyslexia but rather, low comprehension of the text causing abnormal eye movements in M cells. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the importance of M cells in dyslexia from this study.|$|E

The image frames are acquired from the PC image camera {{with the assumption that}} facial movement is limited during talking. First of all, one new lip <b>movement</b> <b>image</b> frame is generated with comparing two successive image frames each other. Second, the fine image noises are removed. Each fitness rate is calculated by comparing the lip feature data as objectly separated images. It is analyzed {{whether or not there is}} the lip <b>movement</b> <b>image</b> through verification to the objects and three images which have higher rates in their fitnesses. As a result of linking the speech & image processing system, the interworking rate shows 99. 3 % even in the various illumination environments.

5000|$|The next {{significant}} step towards film creation was {{the development of}} an understanding of <b>image</b> <b>movement.</b> Simulations of movement date as far back as to 1828 and only four years after Paul Roget discovered the phenomenon he called [...] "Persistence of Vision". Roget showed that when a series of still images are shown at a considerable speed in front of a viewer's eye, the images merge into one registered image that appears to show movement, an optical illusion, since the image is not actually moving. This experience was further demonstrated through Roget's introduction of the thaumatrope, a device that spun a disk with an image on its surface at a fairly high rate of speed.|$|E

This experience was further demonstrated through Roget's introduction of the thaumatrope, a device which spun a disk with an image on its surface at a fairly high rate of speed. The French Lumière brothers' (Louis and Auguste Lumière) first film, Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon, shot in 1894, is considered the first true motion picture.|$|E

[...] She {{is one of the key}} figures of the New Image painting movement which emerged during the 1981 Youth Salon which signalled a return to painting in the then Yugoslavian art. Key members of the New <b>Image</b> <b>movement</b> also include: Star Fio and Đuro Seder. Her works from the 1980s approach geometric abstraction and were made during her stay in New York (1986-1993). She is particularly known for her works from the 1990s where she used ships and airplanes as leitmotifs to explore the relationship of painting to art and technology in today's society which is reliant on modern medias.|$|E

A model based approach is applied, allowing automatic segmentation of thrombus, blood vessel, and tissue in low contrast images. Image sequence analysis takes advantage of preceeding results in three ways: data reduction, improvement of algorithm efficiency, and robustness. This is achieved by a fast motion compensation that takes the <b>image</b> <b>movements</b> in the in vivo observation into consideration. For clinical use in a biomedical laboratory a graphical user interface was developed...|$|R

50|$|Wakoski {{was born}} in Whittier, California and studied at the University of California, Berkeley and {{graduated}} in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts, where she participated in Thom Gunn's poetry workshops. It was there that she first read many of the modernist poets who would influence her writing style. Her early writings were {{considered part of the}} deep <b>image</b> <b>movement</b> that also included the works of Jerome Rothenberg, Robert Kelly, and Clayton Eshleman, among others. She also cites William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski as influences. Her poetry career began in New York City, where she moved with La Monte Young in 1960, and lived until 1973.Her later work is more personal and conversational in the Williams mode. Wakoski is married to the photographer Robert Turney, and is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan.|$|E
50|$|Following the Second World War, artists {{everywhere}} {{were searching}} for meaning and identity, leading to abstract expressionism in the U.S. and art informel in Europe. In the new Yugoslavia, the communist social realism style never took hold, but Exat 51 showed the way with geometric abstraction in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. The Gorgona Group of the 1960s advocated non-conventional forms of visual expression, published their own anti-magazine, and were preoccupied by the absurd. At the same time, the New Tendencies series of exhibits held in conjunction with meetings displayed a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards New Media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focused more on the artists' process. The Biafra Group of the 1970s was figurative and expressionist, engaging their audience directly. By the 1980s, the New <b>Image</b> <b>movement</b> brought a return to more traditional painting and images.|$|E

40|$|Background: The term super-resolution {{refers to}} {{computational}} enhancement of detail in sets of similar images, particularly undersampled images. Undersampling {{is a key}} feature of visual disorders associated with neuroretinal matrix damage. It is conceivable that a neurophysiological equivalent of super-resolution might be recruited in these settings. The need for sets of similar images might be satisfied by augmenting retinal <b>image</b> <b>movements.</b> Methods: Monocular letter acuity thresholds were measured by computer graphics in normal subjects, with and without controlled test target movements. Various degrees of neuroretinal matrix defects were simulated by superposing stationary masks on the test targets...|$|R

50|$|In {{another case}} of callosal alien hand, the patient did not suffer from intermanual {{conflict}} between the hands but rather from a symptom characterized by involuntary mirror movements of the affected hand. When the patient was asked to perform movements with one hand, the other hand would involuntarily perform a mirror <b>image</b> <b>movement</b> which continued even when the involuntary movement {{was brought to the}} attention of the patient, and the patient was asked to restrain the mirrored movement. The patient suffered from a ruptured aneurysm near the anterior cerebral artery, which resulted in the right hand being mirrored by the left hand. The patient described the left hand as frequently interfering and taking over anything the patient tried to do with the right hand. For instance, when trying to grasp a glass of water with the right hand with a right side approach, the left hand would involuntary reach out and grasp hold of the glass through a left side approach.|$|E

A highly complex interweaving of <b>image,</b> <b>movement,</b> text, puppetry, object manipulation, naturalistic and stylised performance underscored by music from Alfred Schnittke, Vladimir Martynov drew on Schulz's stories, his letters and biography.
