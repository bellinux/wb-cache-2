5|$|Originally, the {{aircraft}} was to conduct flight tests at Gostomel {{for three months}} before transferring to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, near Moscow. However, the first prototype was lost when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> its fourth flight on 10 February 1995. During the flight, {{the aircraft}} suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with the An-72 chase plane before spiralling into the ground, erupting into flames; the test crew of seven were killed. Although there were initial allegations of technical issues with the aircraft, it was later determined that the crash had been caused by human error.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Doria was the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm of the season, Doria developed from a tropical wave on August 20 {{to the east}} of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development it attained tropical storm status {{to the east of}} Florida. Doria turned to the north, and reached peak winds of 65mph (105km/h) as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina. It turned to the northeast, and moved through the Mid-Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast on September1. Due to entrainment of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated {{area of low pressure}} developed about 350mi (560km) east of the Leeward Islands on September8. The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E

5|$|After re-emerging {{into the}} Caribbean Sea, Ella deepened further and peaked as 115mph (185km/h) Category3 {{hurricane}} on September2, while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> landfall near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Heavy rainfall lead to flooding, {{which in turn}} caused hundreds to flee their homes, and resulted in 5fatalities. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. The storm became disorganized while moving across the southern coast of Cuba and weakened to a tropical storm by later on September2. Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 and briefly re-strengthened. However, it began to weaken again while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall as a weak tropical storm near Corpus Christi, Texas on September6. It rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day. Rainfall and rough surf caused both inland and coastal flooding in Texas. Offshore, the captain of a snapper boat fell overboard and went missing; he was later presumed to have drowned.|$|E
5|$|Barbara {{strengthened}} into {{a hurricane}} around 1800UTC on May29 while located about 65mi (105km) east-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. At its peak intensity as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> landfall, it had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). With this intensity, Barbara made landfall {{on the coast}} of Tonalá, Chiapas at approximately 1950UTC. This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rapid dissipation occurred. The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000UTC on May30. This was followed by a downgrade to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara's low-level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain. Very early on May 31, the surface circulation of Barbara soon dissipated about 25mi (40km) north-northwest of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, prior to emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's associated leftover moisture partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Atlantic.|$|E

Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E

5|$|The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone (designated as Tropical Cyclone 04B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center) {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclones in Bangladeshi history. Striking in November1988, the tropical system exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November21. Tracking slowly westward, the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea. On November26, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward. Gradually intensifying as it had previously, the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125mph (200km/h) as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> landfall near the Bangladesh-West Bengal border on November29. Although the storm retained strong winds well inland, it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm-equivalent on November30.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

25|$|Attacking in a {{climbing}} curve {{behind the}} MiG-21's with his AIM-7 guidance radar locked on, Ritchie was given continuous range updates by DeBellevue.

25|$|The 500 {{shares of}} the Shropshire Canal were {{initially}} valued at £150 each, making it worth £75,000. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> around £4,000 per year, and rather than buying it, the Shropshire Union decided to lease it instead, for an annual sum of £3,125. The agreement began on 1 November 1849. There were serious problems with subsidence, and the manager recommended that the canal should be converted into a railway in January 1855, but although the Shropshire Union board agreed, their recommendation to the LNWR was ignored. In July 1855, a breach of the canal occurred, when it broke through into the Oakengates railway tunnel. The summit level emptied, causing floods in the town. A second breach occurred in September, on a section which had been re-routed over a mine shaft {{to make way for}} the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, and seven more occurred the following year. The LNWR then obtained an Act of Parliament in 1857, which allowed them to buy the canal for £62,500, and to close it from the Wrockwardine Wood inclined plane to the Windmill inclined plane, and use the bed for a railway. Closure took place on 1 June 1858. Parts of the bed were used for a railway to Coalport, which opened in 1861. The Stirchley tunnel was converted into a cutting as part of this project.|$|E
