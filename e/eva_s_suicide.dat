40|$|Novel {{methods for}} {{assessing}} space suit designs and human performance capabilities are needed as NASA prepares for manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Current human performance tests and training are conducted in space suits that are heavy and expensive, characteristics that constrain possible testing environments and reduce suit availability to researchers. Space suit mock-ups used in planetary exploration simulations are light and relatively inexpensive {{but do not}} accurately simulate the joint stiffness inherent to space suits, a key factor impacting extravehicular activity performance. The MIT Man-Vehicle Laboratory and Aurora Flight Sciences designed and built an actively controlled exoskeleton for space suit simulation called the Extravehicular Activity Space Suit Simulator (<b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3), which can be programmed to simulate the joint torques recorded from various space suits. The goal {{of this research is}} to create a simulator that is lighter and cheaper than a traditional space suit {{so that it can be}} used in a variety of testing and training environments. The <b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3 employs pneumatic actuators to vary joint stiffness and a pre-programmed controller to allow the experimenter to apply torque profiles to mimic various space suit designs in the field. The focus of this thesis is the design, construction, integration, and testing of the hip joint and backpack for the <b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3. The final designs of the other joints are also described. Results from robotic testing to validate the mechanical design and control system are discussed along with the planned improvements for the next iteration of the <b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3. The fianl <b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3 consists of a metal and composite exoskeleton frame with pneumatic actuators that control the resistance of motion in the ankle, knee, and hip joints, and an upper body brace that resists shoulder and elbow motions with passive spring elements. The <b>EVA</b> <b>S</b> 3 is lighter (26 kg excluding the tethered components) and less expensive (under $ 600, 000 including research, design, and personnel) than a modem space suit. Design adjustments and control system improvements are still needed to achieve a desired space suit torque simulation fidelity within 10 % root-mean-square error. by Forrest Edward Meyen. Thesis: S.

40|$|Background: Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 <b>S)</b> <b>suicides</b> {{have been}} {{frequent}} in Japan in recent years. This study {{was performed to}} describe the epidemiologic profile of an outbreak of H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicides</b> in Japan. Methods: In September 2008, questionnaires about patients involved in H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicides</b> were sent to 250 hospitals in Japan. Data collected from each patient included gender, age, clinical manifestations, date of event, location of suicide, source of H 2 S, treatments and neurological outcome. Results: A total of 90 subjects (60 men, 30 women) were enrolled in this study. In this outbreak, the first case was reported in September 2006 and subsequent cases reached a peak in April 2008. There were 60 cases of attempted suicide by generating H 2 <b>S</b> gas (<b>suicide</b> group) and 30 cases of secondary exposure (secondary exposure group). The suicide group included mostly subjects in their twenties. Cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene was reported in 39 cases (65 %). Clinical features of the suicide group inpatients included coma (14 cases), convulsion (1 case), and lung edema (1 case). Patients in suicide group were significantly younger than secondary exposure group (P < 0. 001). The development of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly higher in suicide group (65 % vs. 10 %; P < 0. 001). Death was more frequent in suicide group (70 % vs. 10 %; P < 0. 001) and patients with secondary exposure were discharged with better neurological outcomes (Table 1).     Conclusion: Suicide with H 2 S poisoning has recently been a serious social problem especially in younger generation in Japan. There is extensive information on H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicide</b> methods on the internet. Management of access to websites describing suicide methods is an immediate necessity together with counseling for suicide prevention.   How to cite this article: Iseki K, Ozawa A, Seino K, Goto K, Tase C.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 <b>S)</b> <b>suicides</b> and describe the characteristics of victims in the United States (U. S.) since the technique became common in Japan in 2007. Methods: To ascertain {{the frequency of}} intentional H 2 S related deaths in the U. S. {{prior to the start}} of the Japanese trend in 2007, we searched the multiple-cause-of-death data from the National Vital Statistics System. To collect as much information about the victims as possible, we sent an email to the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) listserv asking for their cooperation in identifying cases of H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicide.</b> To identify cases that were not voluntarily reported by medical examiners but were reported by the media, we conducted Google searches using the search terms: “hydrogen sulfide suicide,” “H 2 S suicide,” “detergent suicide,” “chemical suicide,” and “suicide fad. ” We obtained all available autopsy reports and abstracted information, including the site of the incident, the presence of a note warning others about the toxic gas and the demographic characteristics of the victims. We contacted medical examiners who potentially had custody of the cases that were identified through media reports and requested autopsies of these victims. When unable to obtain the autopsies, we gathered information from the media reports. Results: Forty-five deaths from H 2 S exposure occurred in the U. S. from 1999 to 2007, all unintentional. Responses from the NAME listserv yielded autopsy reports for 11 victims, and Google searches revealed an additional 19 H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicides</b> in the U. S. since 2008. Overall (n= 30), two cases were identified during 2008, 10 in 2009, and 18 in 2010. The majority of victims were white males, less than 30 -years-old, left a warning note, and were found in cars. There were five reports of injuries to first responders, but no secondary fatalities. Conclusion: H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicides</b> are increasing in the U. S., and their incidence is probably underestimated by public health officials and physicians. First responders are at risk when assessing these victims due to the severe toxicity of the gas. Emergency providers must be aware of H 2 <b>S</b> <b>suicides</b> to educate others and care for the rare survivor. [West J Emerg Med. 2011; 12 (3) : 300 - 304. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{sometimes}} dissonance between the medical services {{that the general}} public expects an ED to provide and the acute critical care that emergency clinicians hope to provide.
