This and the general international condemnation after Nyadzonya made the Rhodesians very hesitant to authorise any more <b>external</b> <b>operations,</b> even covertly, while the peace process crawled on during {{the last months of}} 1976. Two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between September and December: first the United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger thrashed out a deal, which in September the Rhodesians accepted and the nationalists rejected, then from October to December 1976 the government and nationalist parties took part in the abortive British-mediated Geneva Conference.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Amin {{allowed an}} Air France {{airliner}} from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by {{two members of}} the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – <b>External</b> <b>Operations</b> (PFLP-EO) and {{two members of the}} German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos were flown in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda.|$|E

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{definition of}} the thermodynamic entropy in an isolated quantum system must satisfy (i) additivity, (ii) extensivity and (iii) the second law of thermodynamics. We show that the diagonal entropy, which is the Shannon entropy in the energy eigenbasis at each instant of time, meets the first two requirements and that the third requirement is satisfied if an arbitrary <b>external</b> <b>operation</b> is performed at typical times. In terms of the diagonal entropy, thermodynamic irreversibility follows from the facts that the Hamiltonian dynamics restricts quantum trajectories under unitary evolution and that the <b>external</b> <b>operation</b> is performed without referring to any particular information about the microscopic state of the system.

40|$|Extracting {{energy from}} {{fluctuations}} {{has been an}} everlasting endeavor. An important strategy is to use information-based operation, which allows energy extraction even from thermal fluctuations. However, it remains unclear whether a blind <b>external</b> <b>operation,</b> ignorant of such fluctuations, will also work. Assuming such a small operation, we find that energy extraction requires a negative response spectrum in a certain frequency region, which inevitably requires an internal power source to maintain. Energy is then extracted by operating the system at these frequencies. Negative response is intrinsic to any system that adapts to a slow <b>external</b> <b>operation,</b> which could be realized through integral feedback control. These are demonstrated through a solvable model. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

2500|$|Operation Entebbe [...] was a {{successful}} counter-terrorist hostage-rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976. A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers had been hijacked by {{two members of the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – <b>External</b> <b>Operations</b> (PFLP-EO) under orders of Wadie Haddad (who had earlier broken away from the PFLP of George Habash), and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers had the stated objective to free 40 Palestinian and affiliated militants imprisoned in Israel and 13 prisoners in four other countries in exchange for the hostages. The flight, which had originated in Tel Aviv with the destination of Paris, was diverted after a stopover in Athens via Benghazi to Entebbe, the main airport of Uganda. The Ugandan government supported the hijackers, and dictator Idi Amin personally welcomed them. After moving all hostages from the aircraft to a disused airport building, the hijackers separated all Israelis and several non-Israeli Jews from the larger group and forced them into a separate room. Over the following two days, 148 non-Israeli hostages were released and flown out to Paris. Ninety-four, mainly Israeli, passengers along with the 12-member Air France crew, remained as hostages and were threatened with death.|$|E
