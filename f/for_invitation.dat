Romania and Slovenia were both considered <b>for</b> <b>invitation</b> in 1997, and each had the backing of a prominent NATO member, France and Italy respectively, but support for enlargement was not unanimous, particularly in the US Congress. In {{an open letter to}} US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and Robert McNamara expressed their concerns about NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given the lack of an external threat from Russia at that time.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2008 {{the medical}} school admits some 327 British {{students}} per year with an additional 26 from overseas {{making it one of}} the largest medical schools in the UK. According to UCAS, Cambridge, Oxford and Newcastle are the most academically selective universities for entry to study medicine in the United Kingdom. During the 2013 admissions cycle for the 5-year A100 undergraduate MBBS course, there were 9.8 applicants for every place and the average entry standard for a successful applicant was 539 UCAS points. [...] Prospective students applying to {{the medical school}} for both the standard (five year) and accelerated (four year) programmes are required to sit the UKCAT admission test. The most recent UKCAT cut-off <b>for</b> <b>invitation</b> to interview for the A100 course was 2780 for 2013 entry (a score in the 84th percentile of test-takers).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there were only}} two {{academic}} societies founded and organized as honor societies, and they were discipline specific [...] Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi, which were founded in 1885 and 1886, respectively. [...] There was also Phi Beta Kappa, a social and literary society that did not originate as an honor society when it was founded in 1776 but would soon become one for the liberal arts and sciences. [...] Although Phi Beta Kappa was not exclusive to one discipline, it did not extend its membership beyond the liberal arts and sciences, hence the establishment of Tau Beta Pi, an honor society for engineering. [...] Phi Beta Kappa became sufficient as an all-campus honor society for liberal arts colleges, but there was no honor society that could serve as such for the universities encompassing both liberal education and also technological and professional education, a mission to which the newly burgeoning land-grant universities of the time were dedicated. [...] That was to change in 1897 when the first organizational meeting of Lambda Sigma Eta (later named Phi Kappa Phi), the nation's first all-discipline honor society, was held in Coburn Hall at the University of Maine under the leadership of undergraduate student Marcus L. Urann. [...] In opposition to what he saw as the separateness and exclusivity promoted by the social fraternities and discipline bound honor societies, Urann wanted to create a society that was defined by inclusiveness and that unified a campus, constituted by [...] "high rank men drawn from all classes and all groups and all societies". [...] Those selected <b>for</b> <b>invitation</b> into the society would be the top ten students of the senior class whose rank did not fall below the 90th percentile for the four years of work at the university. [...] In all, the Society was founded by 10 senior students, two faculty members, and the university president, Abram Winegaard Harris. Urann graduated in 1897, and leadership of Phi Kappa Phi was assumed by President Harris. A year or so later, the name was changed to the Morrill Society, in honor of the sponsor of the Congressional Act which provided for land-grant universities. [...] In 1899, the first woman was initiated into the Society, Pearl Clayton Swain.|$|E

March was a matter of course; but in Colonel Woodburn, Fulkerson encountered a reluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious of having, for motives of his own, rather strained a point in suggesting the colonel to Dryfoos as a fit subject <b>for</b> <b>invitation.</b> There had been only one of the colonel's articles printed as yet, and though it had made a sensation in its way, and started the talk about that number, still it did not fairly constitute him a member of the staff, or even entitle him to recognition as a regular contributor. Fulkerson felt so sure of pleasing him with Dryfoos's message that he delivered it in full family council at the widow's. His daughter received it with all the enthusiasm that Fulkerson had hoped for, but the colonel said, stiffly, [...] "I have not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Dryfoos." [...] Miss Woodburn appeared ready to fall upon him at this, but controlled herself, as if aware that filial authority had its limits, and pressed her lips together without saying anything.|$|E
