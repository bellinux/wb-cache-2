40|$|In my dissertation, I examine factors {{associated}} with firms’ submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification and test if shareholder ratification of auditor selection {{is associated with the}} extent of price competition in the audit market (as measured by audit fees) and audit quality (as measured by clients’ earnings management). The dissertation is motivated from the recent recommendation of the U. S. Treasury’s Advisory Committee on Auditing Profession (ACAP) regarding the submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification votes. The ACAP suggests that this practice may improve the competition in the audit market; yet, there is no empirical evidence supporting the ACAP’s recommendation. My dissertation attempts to fill the gap in the literature on an issue of current interest to the auditing profession. ^ I find that firm size, CEO-Chair duality, insider ownership and institutional ownership are associated with the submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification vote. However, I do not find an association between audit committee variables and the submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification vote. ^ The second essay investigates the association between auditor ratification and audit fees. Audit fees are higher in firms that submit auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification. The finding is not consistent with the increased price competition predicted by the ACAP. ^ The third essay of my dissertation examine whether the submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification is associated with earnings management. I find that firms that submit auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification {{are more likely to have}} lower level of earnings management. ^ Overall, the results suggest that the same factors that are associated with higher quality monitoring also may be associated with the submission of auditor selection <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> ratification vote. The results call into question the one-size-fits-all approach recommended by the ACAP. ...|$|R

25|$|Although it was {{admitted}} {{that those who}} were mere investors {{ought not to be}} liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French société en commandite.

25|$|In July 1996, Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation {{initiated}} a $40million {{hostile takeover bid}} of Sun-Rype. The reasons behind this attempt were to immediately double Clearly Canadian's revenues and give it use of Sun-Rype's bottling plant, thus centralizing its production facilities. In order to initiate the takeover, Clearly Canadian began buying as many shares as possible from local apple growers who had been issued the shares {{over the last five}} decades in return for the process-grade apples used in production by Sun-Rype. At the time of the takeover attempt, Sun-Rype was still a co-operative organization, not a public company, so there were few ways <b>for</b> <b>shareholders</b> to sell their shares.|$|E
25|$|In the 1977 Report of the {{committee}} of inquiry on industrial democracy the Government proposed, {{in line with the}} new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were <b>for</b> <b>shareholders.</b> But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election. Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{between the}} LB and the SER and the {{interpretation}} of the 1848 agreement continued to be difficult throughout the 1850s and 1860s. They reached a low point in 1863 when the SER produced a report <b>for</b> <b>shareholders</b> outlining a long list of the difficulties between the two companies, and the reasons why they considered that the LB had broken the 1848 agreement. The main areas of disagreement listed were at Hastings, allowing the LC to use its lines to Victoria, a proposed LB branch to Bromley, a proposed agreement by the LB to work the Caterham branch, the new LB line to Dorking, LB opposition to the SER attempts at building a line to the west end, the LB agreement to let the LC use its goods facilities at Bricklayers' Arms, and the perennial problem of the shared main line between Redhill and Croydon. However, the chronic congestion over the shared line north of Redhill railway station eased after 1 May 1868 when the route ceased to be on the South Eastern Main Line to Dover following the opening of the 'Sevenoaks cut off' line between St Johns and Tonbridge railway station. A ten-year agreement between the SER and the LBSCR over the use of the station and lines to Coulsdon was signed 1 February 1869 and renewed ten years later.|$|E

500|$|The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway (L&B) opened as an {{independent}} railway in May 1898. It was a single track, [...] narrow gauge railway and was slightly over [...] long running through the rugged and picturesque area bordering Exmoor in North Devon, England. Although opened after the 1896 Light Railways Act came into force, it was authorised and constructed prior to that act. Therefore, as with all other railways, it was authorised under its own Act of Parliament and built to higher (and more costly) standards than similar railways of the time. In the United Kingdom it was notable as being the only narrow gauge line required to use main-line standard signalling. For a short period the line earned a modest return <b>for</b> <b>shareholders,</b> {{but for most of}} its life the L made a loss. In 1923 the L was taken over by the Southern Railway, and eventually closed in September 1935.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} rules for corporate governance are those concerning {{the balance of}} power between the board of directors {{and the members of the}} company. Authority is given or [...] "delegated" [...] to the board to manage the company for the success of the investors. Certain specific decision rights are often reserved <b>for</b> <b>shareholders,</b> where their interests could be fundamentally affected. There are necessarily rules on when directors can be removed from office and replaced. To do that, meetings need to be called to vote on the issues.

40|$|Banks cut {{dividends}} {{with great}} reluctance, as if addicted to them. Their apparent addiction {{is a major}} cause of concern for regulators because it could endanger the whole banking system. However, banks may be rational in maintaining elevated dividends if agency costs are high and dividends substitute <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> monitoring. Banks may rely on persistent dividend policies to uphold a reputation among investors, especially during crises, when issuing equity becomes likelier. In support of this hypothesis, we find that during and after the financial crisis, dividend persistence increases with the severity of agency costs to which banks are subject; it decreases in the presence of concentrated shareholders, except when stress is acute. By contrast, share repurchases also substitute <b>for</b> <b>shareholder</b> monitoring but trigger no addiction. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

While post-war discourse centred on how to achieve effective [...] "corporate democracy" [...] <b>for</b> <b>shareholders</b> or other stakeholders, many scholars have shifted to discussing the law in terms of principal–agent problems. On this view, the basic issue of corporate law is that when a [...] "principal" [...] party delegates his property (usually the shareholder's capital, but also the employee's labour) into the control of an [...] "agent" [...] (i.e. the director of the company) there is the possibility that the agent will act in his own interests, be [...] "opportunistic", rather than fulfill the wishes of the principal.
