5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury.

Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To clarify {{whether the}} {{symptoms}} of inattention and distractibility commonly seen {{in children and adolescents}} with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) represent true comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or a manifestation of obsessional anxiety. METHOD: Phenotypic features and functional correlates of ADHD-like symptoms were examined <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with and without OCD from a large sample of pediatric psychiatry patients consecutively referred since 1997. RESULTS: The number, frequency, and types of core ADHD symptoms as well as ADHD-associated functional indices were identical <b>in</b> all <b>youths</b> with DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} comorbid OCD. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that when ADHD-like symptoms are seen <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with OCD, they reflect a true comorbid state of OCD plus ADHD and that the ADHD syndrome may be independent of OCD <b>in</b> comorbid <b>youths...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of psychotropic medications-in particular, mood {{stabilizers}} [...] <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with {{psychiatric illness}} has grown. There are trends toward polypharmacy {{and the increased}} use of newer mood stabilizers <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with psychiatric illness despite a paucity of studies examining the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of these agents in the pediatric population. METHOD: PubMed was used to identify peer-reviewed publications from the past 30 years (January 1975 to August 2005) studying lithium and anticonvulsants <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with psychiatric illness. RESULTS: Evidence supporting the use of lithium and valproate in the treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder and reactive aggression has grown. Evidence for the use of other anticonvulsants <b>in</b> <b>youths</b> with psychiatric illness is sparse. Side effects from lithium and anticonvulsants are typically mild to moderate. Data are accumulating in regard to the longer-term safety of lithium and DVPX in the juvenile psychiatric population. Although data in regard to the newer anticonvulsants are limited, they may have more desirable side-effect profiles. CONCLUSION: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lithium and anticonvulsants are greatly needed as clinical use of these agents has risen without sufficient evidence supporting their efficacy in the pediatric population...|$|R

5|$|Similar to {{fighting}} in ice hockey, fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian Lacrosse Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct.

In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable.

5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly <b>in</b> <b>youth.</b> Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s.

In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act.
