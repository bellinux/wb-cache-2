Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of UC-IPAA patients, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50 %. Although the aetiology of pouchitis remains unclear, accumulating evidence suggests that a <b>dysbiosis</b> <b>of</b> the pouch microbiota and an abnormal mucosal immune response are implicated in its pathogenesis.

Introduction: Factors {{initiating}} human {{ulcerative colitis}} (UC) are unknown. <b>Dysbiosis</b> <b>of</b> bacteria {{has been proposed}} to initiate UC but to date neither the nature <b>of</b> <b>dysbiosis</b> nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. Method: To assess whether a <b>dysbiosis</b> <b>of</b> anaerobic nitrate respiration could explain the microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of ulcerative colitis by measuring the effect of NO on human colonocytes and observing colonic NO production. Results: Anaerobic nitrate respiration yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher luminal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide but not NO alone impairs lipid and protein synthesis of epithelial cells explaining the membrane, tight junctional, ion channel and beta oxidation changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics useful in treating UC.

Bile acids (BA) could play a role as they are endogenous laxatives and are metabolized by gut microbiota. We compared fecal BA profiles and microbiota in healthy subjects (HS) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), and we searched for an association with symptoms. Methods Clinical features and stool samples were collected in IBS-D patients and HS. Fecal BA profiles were generated using HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The fecal microbiota composition was assessed by q-PCR targeting dominant bacterial groups and species implicated in BA transformation. Key Results Fourteen IBS-D patients and 18 HS were included. The two groups were comparable in terms of age and sex. The percentage of fecal primary BA was significantly higher in IBS-D patients than in HS, and it was significantly correlated with stool consistency and frequency. Fecal counts of all bacteria, lactobacillus, coccoides, leptum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were similar. There was a significant increase of Escherichia coli and a significant decrease of leptum and bifidobacterium in IBS-D patients.

This study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in Chinese CD patients using cultureindependent techniques. Methods/Principal Findings: Eighteen patients with CD and 9 healthy controls were included in this study. The faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with DNA sequencing and BLAST. We showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of CD patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p, 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction Chronic {{tonsillitis}} (CT) {{occupies a}} leading {{place in the}} structure of general Oto-rhino-laryngology (ORL) pathology which is characterized by a tendency to {{an increase in the number}} of patients with recurrent course, the development of complications and the diversity of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of onset. It has been established that the most acceptable tactic for the prevention of exacerbations of chronic tonsillitis is the use of various groups of drugs that enhance the humoral immunity of the mucous membranes. The drug Ismigen is an immunostimulant based on a bacterial lysate, which increases the body's resistance to infections due to an increase in serum and secretory antibodies, activation of cellular and humoral factors of nonspecific immunity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of Ismigen in the complex treatment of patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis by studying the dynamics of microbiological indicators. Materials and methods. To achieve this goal, 31 patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis (CDT) were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the proposed treatment regimen: Group A: patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis who underwent laser tonsillotomy - 15 patients; Group B: patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis who underwent laser tonsillotomy with further immunostimulation with the drug Ismigen - 16 patients. The control group (CG) consisted of 17 practically healthy individual. Patient in group B had sublingual Ismigen postoperatively: once daily for a period for a period of 10 days. Microbiological examination of the material from the mucous membranes of the tonsils or oropharynx was carried out in dynamics before the treatment, 7 days after the treatment and 1 - 2 months after the end of the course of treatment. A comprehensive assessment of the status of the oropharynx microbiocenosis was carried out in accordance with the criteria described earlier.

Changes leading to specific biological states including some of the more complex diseases can now be characterized with relative ease. It is known that gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly Crohn 2 ̆ 7 s disease and ulcerative colitis, exhibiting symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies also showed increased frequency of oral manifestations among IBD patients, indicating aberrations in the oral microbiota. Based on these observations, we analyzed the composition of salivary microbiota of 35 IBD patients by 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and compared it with that of 24 healthy controls (HCs). The results showed that Bacteroidetes was significantly increased with a concurrent decrease in Proteobacteria in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients. The dominant genera, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Gemella, were found to largely contribute to dysbiosis (dysbacteriosis) observed in the salivary microbiota of IBD patients. Analysis of immunological biomarkers in the saliva of IBD patients showed elevated levels of many inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulin A, and a lower lysozyme level. A strong correlation was shown between lysozyme and IL- 1 ? levels and the relative abundance of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Haemophilus and Veillonella.

Aims: To review the use of faecal transplantation therapy for the management of gastrointestinal disorders. Methods: Available articles on faecal transplantation in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, were identified through a Pubmed search and bibliographies of review articles on the subject were collated. Results: 239 patients who had undergone faecal transplantation were reported. Seventeen of twenty two studies of faecal transplantation were in fulminant or refractory Clostridium difficile. Studies of faecal transplantation are heterogeneous regarding the patients, donors, screening, methods of administration, and definition of response. Faecal transplantation for Clostridium difficile has been demonstrated to be effective in 145 / 166 (87 %) patients.

However, our understandings of the processes by which these microbes initiate, maintain, or modulate skin diseases is lacking. Moreover, previous research on the topic has largely been limited by cross-sectional study designs, neglecting the natural dynamism of microbial communities. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>skin</b> microbiome in various diseases. In the first section, we characterize the diversity and dynamics of both bacterial and fungal communities colonizing chronic wounds and its associations with clinical outcomes. In a study of 100 subjects with diabetic foot ulcers, we sampled the wound microbiota in 2 -week intervals until healing, amputation of 26 weeks of follow-up. We demonstrate the high levels of community instability in chronic wounds and expose the positive association between wound healing community instability. We also reveal the effect of antibiotic perturbation on the microbiota. The fungal component was found to have associations with various bacteria and clinical outcomes. Our results should inform the design of future studies and provides evidence that microbial dynamics may be an effective biomarker for identifying high-risk ulcers. The second section investigates the body-site specific effects of psoriasis on the skin microbiome and how it responds to therapy.
