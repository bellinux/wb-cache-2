5|$|The film, {{independently}} {{produced and}} financed by Hitchcock, {{was shot at}} Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. Psycho was shot on a tight budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started {{in the morning and}} finished by sixp.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> Chasen's). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50mm lenses on 35mm cameras. This trick closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.|$|E
5|$|During {{a school}} {{trip to a}} camp, a nude video of Anju is taken {{on a cell phone}} camera hidden in the bathroom. The culprit is {{revealed}} as Varun, the son of the Inspector-general of police, Geetha. When Varun meets Anju later to blackmail her, she breaks his cell phone and inadvertently kills him. With her mother's help, she hides his body in a compost pit that was originally made for manure. Unbeknownst to them, this is witnessed by Anu. Jyothi tells Rambabu about the incident and he devises a plan to save his family from imprisonment. He gets rid of the broken cell phone. However, as he is disposing of Varun's car, Rambabu is seen by a corrupt police constable named Veerabhadram, who holds a grudge against him. Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to Vizianagaram, where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> a restaurant.|$|E

5|$|The Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have time to keep the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E

25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E
25|$|In 1815 NWC partner Duncan Cameron now {{began to}} {{implement}} the company’s plan to dislodge the Red River settlers. This was done primarily by threatening to unleash the Indians on the colony and offering the colonists free passage to Upper Canada. Not every Nor’Wester in the Red River District {{was interested in the}} destruction of Selkirk’s colony. Around this time, the NWC clerk Aulay McAulay refused to sell firearms and ammunition to the Métis to use against the colony. Consequently, at the next rendezvous at Fort William, Aulay was not allowed to <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> the general mess-table, the other clerks were ordered not to associate with him, and he was sent back to Montreal aboard a loaded Montreal canoe as a sign of disgrace.|$|E

25|$|Helen Barnes died in {{the early}} morning hours of June 1, 1925, in an {{automobile}} accident not far from Woodmont, Connecticut. She and her boyfriend, John Griffin, a junior at Sheffield Scientific School and son of a well-to-do manufacturer from Indiana, were traveling at a high rate of speed when their car struck a slow moving vehicle, careened into another and then rolled over a number of times killing the two almost instantly. Friends of Griffin felt the other driver, who was later cited for driving without a vehicle license, shared some the blame for the tragedy due to his erratic driving. Barnes and Griffin had gone out that morning to <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> an all-night hotdog stand in nearby East Haven. Though there had been no official announcement, Griffin had previously told friends that the two planned to marry.|$|E
25|$|On 26 February 1649, Christina {{announced}} that she {{had decided not to}} marry and instead wanted her first cousin Charles to be heir to the throne. While the nobility objected to this, the three other estates– clergy, burghers, and peasants– accepted it. The coronation took place on 22 October 1650. Christina went to the castle of Jacobsdal where she entered in a coronation carriage draped in black velvet embroidered in gold and pulled by three white horses. The procession to Storkyrkan was so long that when the first carriages arrived, the last ones had not yet left Jacobsdal. All four estates were invited to <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> the castle. Fountains at the market place splashed out wine for three days, roast was served, and illuminations sparkled, followed by a themed parade (The Illustrious Splendors of Felicity) on 24 October.|$|E
500|$|The Alden Tavern is {{well known}} for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, {{commander}} of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served [...] "the common dish of corn and beans" [...] and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording in The Boys of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: [...] "Do you give me the pigs' feed". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.|$|E

500|$|The Quakers {{emigrated to}} the New World from the {{northern}} English Midlands during the 17th century, and eventually settled primarily in the Delaware Valley. They were similar to the Puritans in the strictness that they applied to everyday life, though their religious teachings were far different. Their food was plain and simple. Excessive consumption was discouraged and failure to eat or drink moderately was punished with public acts of criticism. William Penn was the founder of Pennsylvania and an important figure {{in the development of}} the Quaker movement, and he encouraged frugality in his followers with advice such as, [...] "If thou rise with an appetite thou are sure never to sit down without one". The Quakers, like the Puritans, encountered an abundance of food in the New World: forests rich with game and berries, streams teeming with fish, and abundant flocks of birds. Still the asceticism persevered. Many Quakers avoided eating butter as a form of self-mortification, and the most eccentric followers would avoid tea and meat. The idealist and pacifist ideas of the Quakers also encouraged many to boycott products that were considered to be tainted by sin. This included butter, due to its role in raising war taxes, and coffee, because it was produced by slave labor. Eating habits were more egalitarian than those of either the Puritans or the Virginian Anglicans. At meals, entire households would <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> the same table, including children and servants.|$|E
500|$|Parker voices {{his suspicions}} about {{the crew of}} [...] "Skyship One" [...] to Penelope after he notes their lack of {{knowledge}} about the airship and Penelope relays this message to Alan but during the conversation uncovers a listening device in her room after Skyship One passes through a violent storm. Foster and his associates have secretly been recording and editing Penelope's speech to assemble a false transmission, which requests that Jeff dispatch Thunderbirds 1 and 2, with Brains on board, to El Hadim airfield where the Hood and his henchmen will be waiting to hi-jack the machines. Unable to get Penelope to say the detailed part of the message (landing coordinates of the airstrip) naturally, they use a fake newspaper to get her to read the final details aloud to complete {{the last part of the}} message just before their stop at the Egyptian Pyramids. When Skyship One makes its final stop in the Swiss Alps, while Foster, Alan, Tin-Tin, and Lady Penelope <b>dine</b> <b>at</b> a steam train themed inn, Parker locates the editing equipment and informs the guests, whilst they attempt to figure out what is going on the edited message is transmitted and sent to John on Thunderbird 5. Alan determines the threat against International Rescue just in time for Penelope to contact Jeff in person and warn that Thunderbirds 1 and 2 are about to be ambushed. Dispatched by Jeff in accordance with the transmission, Scott and Virgil now open fire on and annihilate the Hood's hideout.|$|E
