2500|$|The opening match saw {{the first}} time teaming of third {{generation}} wrestler Soberano, Jr. (son of CMLL wrestler Euforia and grandson of wrestler El Soberano) teamed up with second or third generation wrestler Stigma (his exact family relationship to CMLL booking team member Juan Manuel Mar and CMLL wrestler Skándalo has not been revealed, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is one.) The two tecnicos (wrestlers who portray the [...] "good guys") take on the brother duo of Los Hombres del Camoflaje ("Men in Camouflage"; Artillero and Super Comando) in the opening match of the show. The much more experienced brothers defeated Stigma and Sobreano, Jr. in three falls. The victory came {{as a result of}} Super Comando forcing Stigma to submit to his unique [...] "Comando Clutch" [...] submission hold, followed by Los Hombres applying their Artilleria Pesada double team finishing move, In the second match Ángel Azteca, Jr., Pegasso and Starman teamed up to take on the team of Hijo del Signo, Hooligan and Virus. At the previous week's Super Viernes Virus and Hooligan failed to get along, {{going so far as to}} see Virus and Cancerbero attack Hooligan after the match, tearing his mask apart. The distention continued in this match, as the tecnico team won both the first and the second fall straight out. Following the match Hooligan attacked Virus, including throwing Virus hard against the steel guardrail, ending the attack by tearing Virus' Los Cancerberos del Infierno tights apart. In the third fall high flying tecnicosÁngel de Oro, El Hijo del Fantasma and Rey Cometa took on the rudo (Bad guy) team of La Fievre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever") team of Japanese wrestlersOkumura and Namajague, teaming up with Mexican Misterioso, Jr. Ángel de Oro won the first fall for his team when he forced Okumura to submit after applying a La Mecedora (Modified Campana) hold. The rudo team came back and won the second fall, pushing the match to its full three falls. During the third fall the tecnico team showed off their high flying skills, successfully performing several dives out of the ring to their opponents on the floor. The third fall ended in a disqualification for La Fievre Amarilla and Misterioso, Jr. when Namajague landed a foul kick on Rey Cometa, which the referee caught and disqualified him for.|$|E

A succession of ages and generations might be supposed to have blotted out your claims from existence; for it is not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should be no term of time which can make security for lack of fact and a few formalities. At all events, he had satisfied himself that his duty was to act as he has done." ...|$|E

The mission remained on NASA's roadmap for planetary science as of the 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

5000|$|O'Farrell {{has stated}} that well into the 1990s being Irish in Britain could be fraught: “We used to get endless Irish jokes, even from {{teachers}}. If I had to spell my name at school, teachers would say things like, ‘Oh, are your family in the IRA?’ Teachers would say this to a 12-year-old kid {{in front of the}} whole class.” “They thought it was hilarious to say, ‘Ha ha, your dad’s a terrorist’. It wasn’t funny at all.” “I wish I could say that it’s common today because people are less racist, but I think it’s <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are new immigrants who are getting it now.” Nevertheless, not until 2013's Instructions for a Heatwave did Irish subjects become a part of her work.http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/maggie-o-farrell-teachers-would-say-are-your-family-in-the-ira-1.2687468 ...|$|E

[...] Before Wilson could do <b>just</b> <b>that,</b> <b>there</b> were several key bridges over the Chattahoochee River that needed taking. One such bridge led into the town of West Point. To avoid any delay in the raid, Wilson separated his force sending a 3,700-man detachment under Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange to capture both the bridge and the town. Thus, the Battle of West Point, Georgia, was fought on Easter Sunday, April 16, when Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange's brigade attacked an earthwork defensive position named Fort Tyler.|$|E

50|$|The {{assumption}} of uniformity in a proto-language, {{implicit in the}} comparative method, is problematic. Even in small language communities there are always dialect differences, whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors. The Pirahã language of Brazil is spoken by only several hundred people, but it has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women. Campbell points out:It {{is not so much}} that the comparative method 'assumes' no variation; rather, it is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is nothing built into the comparative method which would allow it to address variation directly....This {{assumption of}} uniformity is a reasonable idealization; it does no more damage {{to the understanding of the}} language than, say, modern reference grammars do which concentrate on a language's general structure, typically leaving out consideration of regional or social variation.|$|E
5000|$|The word magi {{originally}} {{referred to}} Zoroastrian priests in Persia, {{but by the}} time this gospel was written it had come to mean anyone who dabbled in the occult arts such as magic, astrology, and dream interpretation. Since the chapter later refers to their interest in stars it is likely magi here refers to astrologers. The KJV translation as [...] "wise men" [...] is considered by modern scholars as quite inaccurate, mostly motivated by the desire not to imply any support for the arcane arts. Matthew never says how many magi there are, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are more than one. Traditions such as the magi being kings and having names developed later. There are many different translations of the word found, such as [...] "wise men" [...] and [...] "astrologers". The only other place the word occurs in the New Testament is at Acts 13:6 and Acts 13:8. The magi in question is a negative figure and the word is more often translated as magician or sorcerer.|$|E
5000|$|Sean French {{wrote in}} the New Statesman: [...] "There is {{something}} heroic about this argument {{and it would be}} a good subject for a novel about the dangers of creating theories out of nothing. Vladimir Nabokov should have written it. It is not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are weak links in the theory. There are no links in the theory. No evidence that Hitler, in his final unhappy year, even knew a boy two years above him. If they did know each other, there is no evidence that he was the boy Hitler distrusted, no evidence that Hitler's remarks on snitching related to specific incidents at the Linz Realschule, no evidence that Wittgenstein informed on his fellow pupils." [...] In the same journal, Roz Kaveney calls it [...] "a stupid and dishonest book", and says [...] "Cornish's intention is to claim Wittgenstein for his own brand of contemplative mysticism, which he defines as the great insight that IndoEuropeans (or, as he unregenerately terms them, Aryans) brought to Hinduism and Buddhism." ...|$|E
