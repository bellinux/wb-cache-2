40|$|Abstract Background Phospholipid {{hydroperoxide}} glutathione peroxidases (PHGPx), {{the most}} abundant isoforms of GPx families, interfere directly with hydroperoxidation of lipids. Biochemical properties of these proteins vary along with their <b>donor</b> <b>organisms,</b> which has complicated the phylogenetic classification of diverse PHGPx-like proteins. Despite efforts for comprehensive analyses, the evolutionary aspects of GPx genes in invertebrates remain largely unknown. Results We isolated GPx homologs via in silico screening of genomic and/or expressed sequence tag databases of eukaryotic organisms including protostomian species. Genes showing strong similarity to the mammalian PHGPx genes were commonly found in all genomes examined. GPx 3 - and GPx 7 -like genes were additionally detected from nematodes and platyhelminths, respectively. The overall distribution of the PHGPx-like proteins with different biochemical properties was biased across taxa; selenium- and glutathione (GSH) -dependent proteins were exclusively detected in platyhelminth and deuterostomian species, whereas selenium-independent and thioredoxin (Trx) -dependent enzymes were isolated in the other taxa. In comparison of genomic organization, the GSH-dependent PHGPx genes showed a conserved architectural pattern, while their Trx-dependent counterparts displayed complex exon-intron structures. A codon for the resolving Cys engaged in reductant binding {{was found to be}} substituted in a series of genes. Selection pressure to maintain the selenocysteine codon in GSH-dependent genes also appeared to be relaxed during their evolution. With the dichotomized fashion in genomic organizations, a highly polytomic topology of their phylogenetic trees implied that the GPx genes have multiple evolutionary intermediate forms. Conclusion Comparative analysis of invertebrate GPx genes provides informative evidence to support the modular pathways of GPx evolution, which have been accompanied with sporadic expansion/deletion and exon-intron remodeling. The differentiated enzymatic properties might be acquired by the evolutionary relaxation of selection pressure and/or biochemical adaptation to the acting environments. Our present study would be beneficial to get detailed insights into the complex GPx evolution, and to understand the molecular basis of the specialized physiological implications of this antioxidant system in their respective <b>donor</b> <b>organisms.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{potential}} risks of food allergy presented by any new GM crop {{is an important part}} of the regulatory review process required by most countries. To manage food safety, developers should ensure that they have avoided introducing a known allergen and potentially cross-reacting proteins, as well as have eliminated the risk that the recombinant protein becomes a de novo allergen. However, no studies have addressed the matrix effects between recipient crops and the gene <b>donor</b> <b>organisms</b> on {{the potential}} risk of allergenicity of the newly expressed proteins in GM crops. The overall goal of this dissertation is to investigate potential differences in matrix effects on the newly introduced protein by developing two model transgenic soybeans encoding major peanut allergens, Ara h 2 or Ara h 6. The 2 S albumins of peanut were chosen as model transgenic proteins because peanut is one of the most important sources of food allergy in most geographical regions and these proteins are dominant allergens. Additionally, although soybeans and peanuts are both legumes and have overall similar food component characteristics, there are marked differences in the strength of food allergic reactions. Development of these GM soybean lines includes characterization of the recombinant proteins and ultimately they can be used for comparison of allergenicity with peanut and non-GM soybean. ^ The first step in this evaluation required the development of two transgenic soybean lines using Agrobacterium mediated transformation. The second aim was to purify gram-level Ara h 2 from peanut and characterize it. The third aim was to purify and characterize recombinant Ara h 2 (rAra h 2) expressed in the GM soybean for use in comparisons with the natural Ara h 2 (nAra h 2) from peanut. ^ A different post-translational proteolysis was revealed existing between soybean and peanut. However, the circular dichroism measurement demonstrated rAra h 2 and nAra h 2 shared very similar secondary and tertiary structures. This result indicates although different matrix effects might exist between recipient crops and gene <b>donor</b> <b>organisms,</b> there is little possibility to introduce an increased risk of allergenicity of recombinant proteins in this developed model of GM crops. ...|$|R

40|$|Detection of nonauthorized genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) has always presented an analytical challenge because the complete sequence data needed to detect them are generally unavailable although sequence similarity to known GMOs can be expected. A new approach, differential quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for detection of nonauthorized GMOs is presented here. This method {{is based on the}} presence of several common elements (e. g., promoter, genes of interest) in different GMOs. A statistical model was developed to study the difference between the number of molecules of such a common sequence and the number of molecules identifying the approved GMO (as determined by border-fragment-based PCR) and the <b>donor</b> <b>organism</b> of the common sequence. When this difference differs statistically from zero, the presence of a nonauthorized GMO can be inferred.

Here we demonstrate the transfer by conjugation of the catabolic plasmid pJP 4, using a model system with donor and recipient organisms. The <b>donor</b> <b>organism</b> was Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP 134 and the recipient organism was Variovorax paradoxus isolated from a toxic waste site. Plasmid pJP 4 contains genes for mercury resistance and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) acid degradation. A transfer frequency of approximately 1 / 10 (3) donor and recipient cells (parent cells) was observed on solid agar media, decreasing to 1 / 10 (5) parent cells in sterile soil and finally 1 / 10 (6) parent cells in 2, 4 -D-amended, nonsterile soil. Presumptive transconjugants were confirmed to be resistant to Hg, to be capable of degrading 2, 4 -D, and to contain a plasmid of size comparable to that of pJP 4. In addition, we confirmed the transfer through PCR amplifications of the tfdB gene. Although transfer of pJP 4 did occur at a high frequency in pure culture, the rate was significantly decreased by the introduction of abiotic (sterile soil) and biotic (nonsterile soil) stresses.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Laterally {{transferred}} genes {{have often}} been identified {{on the basis of}} compositional features that distinguish them from ancestral genes in the genome. These genes are usually A+T-rich, arguing either that there is a bias towards acquiring genes from <b>donor</b> <b>organisms</b> having low G+C contents or that genes acquired from organisms of similar genomic base compositions go undetected in these analyses. RESULTS:By examining the genome contents of closely related, fully sequenced bacteria, we uncovered genes confined to a single genome and examined the sequence features of these acquired genes. The analysis shows that few transfer events are overlooked by compositional analyses. Most observed lateral gene transfers do not correspond to free exchange of regular genes among bacterial genomes, but more probably represent the constituents of phages or other selfish elements. CONCLUSIONS:Although bacteria tend to acquire large amounts of DNA, the origin of these genes remains obscure. We have shown that contrary to what is often supposed, their composition cannot be explained by a previous genomic context. In contrast, these genes fit the description of recently described genes in lambdoid phages, named 'morons'. Therefore, results from genome content and compositional approaches to detect lateral transfers should not be cited as evidence for genetic exchange between distantly related bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops {{have achieved}} {{success in the}} marketplace and their benefits extend beyond the overall increase in harvest yields to include lowered use of insecticides and decreased carbon dioxide emissions. The most widely grown GM crops contain gene/s for targeted insect protection, herbicide tolerance, or both. Plant expression of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (Cry) insecticidal proteins have been the primary way to impart insect resistance in GM crops. Although deemed safe by regulatory agencies globally, previous studies have been the basis for discussions around the potential immuno-adjuvant effects of Cry proteins. These studies had limitations in study design. The studies used animal models with extremely high doses of Cry proteins, which when given using the ig route were co-administered with an adjuvant. Although the presumption exists that Cry proteins may have immunostimulatory activity and therefore an adjuvanticity risk, the evidence shows that Cry proteins are expressed at very low levels in GM crops and are unlikely to function as adjuvants.

The functional relevance of Tn 916 Xis binding sites on the arms of the transposon has been assessed in vivo using a transposon excision assay.

These sites lie in between the core and arm sites recognized by Tn 916 Int, suggesting that the Tn 916 Xis protein enhances excision {{in a manner similar to}} the excisionase protein of bacteriophage λ, serving an architectural role in the stabilization of protein-nucleic acid structures required for strand synapsis.

40|$|Many {{proteins}} from plant pathogens {{affecting the}} {{interaction with the}} host plant have dual functions: they promote virulence on the host species and they function as avirulence determinants by eliciting defense reactions in host cultivars expressing the appropriate resistance genes. In viruses all proteins encoded by the small genomes {{can be expected to}} be essential for viral development in the host. However, in different plants surveillance systems have evolved that are able to recognize most of these proteins. Bacteria and fungi have specialized pathogenicity and virulence genes. Many of the latter were originally identified through the resistance gene- dependent elicitor activity of their products. Their role in virulence only became apparent when they were inactivated or transferred to different microbes or after their ectopic expression in host plants. Many microbes appear to maintain these genes despite their disadvantageous effect, introducing only few mutations to abolish the interaction of their products with the plant recognition system. This has been interpreted as been indicative of a virulence function of the gene products that is not impaired by the mutations. Alternatively, in particular in bacteria there is now evidence that pathogenicity was acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Genes supporting virulence in the <b>donor</b> <b>organism's</b> original host appear to have traveled along. Being gratuitous in the new situation, they may have been inactivated without loss of any beneficial function for the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Most {{parametric}} {{methods for}} detecting foreign genes in bacterial genomes use a scoring function that measures the atypicality {{of a gene}} {{with respect to the}} bulk of the genome. Genes whose features are sufficiently atypical—lying beyond a threshold value—are deemed foreign. Yet these methods fail when the range of features of donor genomes overlaps with that of the recipient genome, leading to misclassification of foreign and native genes; existing parametric methods choose threshold parameters to balance these error rates. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a two-pronged approach to minimize the misclassification of genes. First, beyond classifying genes as merely atypical, a gene clustering method based on Jensen–Shannon entropic divergence identifies classes of foreign genes that are also similar to each other. Second, genome position is used to reassign genes among classes whose composition features overlap. This process minimizes the misclassification of either native or foreign genes that are weakly atypical. The performance of this approach was assessed using artificial chimeric genomes and then applied to the well-characterized Escherichia coli K 12 genome. Not only were foreign genes identified {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, but genes originating from the same <b>donor</b> <b>organism</b> were effectively grouped...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} plant {{parasitism}} within the phylum Nematoda is intriguing. The ability to parasitize plants has originated {{at least three}} times independently during nematode evolution and, as more molecular data has emerged, it has become clear that multiple instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria and fungi have {{played a crucial role in}} the nematode’s adaptation to this new lifestyle. The first reported HGT cases in plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) were genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. Other putative examples of HGT were subsequently described, including genes that may be involved in the modulation of the plant’s defense system, the establishment of a nematode feeding site and the synthesis or processing of nutrients. Although in many cases it is difficult to pinpoint the <b>donor</b> <b>organism,</b> candidate donors are usually soil dwelling and are either plant-pathogenic or plant-associated microorganisms, hence occupying the same ecological niche as the nematodes.

40|$|Feeding {{the growing}} world {{population}} {{is one of}} the biggest challenges for the 21 st century. Potato, being the fourth crop in the human diet, after maize, wheat and rice, plays an important role in this respect. Like other crops, potato is exposed to a range of potentially yield-reducing factors: Pathogens, a (possibly changing) bad climate and averse soil conditions. Research into the response of potato to these influences, often determined by hereditary factors, is necessary to meet a growing demand for potatoes. A map of genetically determined properties is crucial for this research. Several techniques are available to produce maps – each with it's own merits and demerits, resulting in maps of different qualities and with different resolutions. Two often used mapping techniques are genetic mapping, where the inheritance of multiple traits (“markers”) is studied in offspring using statistical analysis and the markers ordered accordingly, and physical mapping on the basis of “Bacterial Artificial Chromosome” (BAC) libraries. BAC libraries consist of a large number of individual bacterial strains (BAC clones), each containing a randomly sampled section of DNA of the organism being studied. By comparing individual BAC clones with each other, finding out where the <b>donor</b> <b>organism's</b> (the organism being studied) DNA sections overlap, the BAC clones can be ordered into groups or “contigs”. Comparison is often done on the basis of so called fingerprints – a pattern consisting of DNA fragments of different lengths, resembling a bar-code pattern. A similarity in fingerprint patterns between two BAC clones indicates that the BAC clones contain similar (overlapping) sections of the <b>donor</b> <b>organism's</b> DNA. Recently an ultra dense genetic map has been published, containing more than 10, 000 markers produced using “Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism” (AFLPTM) marker technology. The integrated physical and genetic map that is the subject of this thesis extends this genetic map, and is in itself the starting point for determining the detailed DNA sequence of potato, as is currently being undertaken by an international scientific collaboration within the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC, [URL] First step in creating this integrated physical and genetic map was creation, fingerprinting and characterization of a BAC library, as described in chapter two. BACs were individually fingerprinted using an AFLP based protocol, and (amongst others) these AFLP BAC-fingerprints were compared to a theoretical model of the distribution of fragment lengths in AFLP fingerprints to determine if fingerprinting was successful. Correction and refinement of some of the mapping algorithms that were used to create the genetic map are discussed in chapters three and four, resulting in refined genetic map locations for the AFLP markers and the capability to process marker scores containing arbitrary types of scoring ambiguities while conserving all available information. An extension to the basic principle offers the possibility to also map AFLP markers derived from different chromosomes that are indistinguishable on the basis of their AFLP fragment length alone. In chapter five, systematic differences in AFLP BAC fingerprints are discussed that are caused by the use of different machines for capillary electrophoresis, by the use of different fluorescent DNA labels and by different capillary position. These systematic differences are (partially) corrected by using the (abundant) AFLP fingerprints of BAC clones containing (part of) the potato chloroplast genome as a reference sample. By ordering the AFLP fingerprints of individual BAC clones on the basis of fingerprint similarity, a physical map is produced that is integrated with the genetic map using a novel, ultra efficient, procedure described in chapter six. This procedure, “AFLP contig matching” uses intricate experimental design and combinatorial analysis to obtain an integrated physical and genetic map with the least amount of effort...|$|R

No mercury-resistant, 2, 4 -D-degrading organisms with large plasmids or the tfdB gene {{were found in the}} 2, 4 -D-amended but uninoculated control microcosm. These data clearly show that the plasmid pJP 4 was transferred to indigenous soil recipients. Even more striking is the fact that not only did the indigenous transconjugant population survive and proliferate but also enhanced rates of 2, 4 -D degradation occurred relative to microcosms in which no such gene transfer occurred. Overall, these data indicate that gene transfer from introduced organisms is an effective means of bioaugmentation and that survival of the introduced organism is not a prerequisite for biodegradation that utilizes introduced biodegradative genes...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) involves {{the acquisition of}} genetic material from a <b>donor</b> <b>organism</b> and its incorporation into the genome of the recipient, without the two organisms being in a parent-offspring relationship. Genes, gene fragments and even operons can be transferred across broad taxonomic boundaries and this can contribute to genetic novelty of a genome. Hence, the genealogical history of a genome cannot be portrayed simply as a lineal descent from a common ancestor that existed in some distant past because a lineage can trace its ancestry from a myriad of sources, both living and extinct. In this dissertation, I present three different cases of HGT: transfers between close relatives, between distantly related taxa and from ancient lineages. The focus of this dissertation is on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a group of enzymes that play an integral role in the translation machinery. Phylogenetic analyses of these enzymes indicate that HGT has {{played an important role}} in their evolutionary histories. In some cases, the transferred genes acquired from distant relatives endow the recipient with novel metabolic processes and physiological capacities, and can therefore result to topologies that conflict with the organismal tree. However, in most instances, a bias to transfer genes with closely related partners will maintain and strengthen similarity within groups. Looking at the overall Tree/Net of Life, we therefore see that microbial lineages and relationships are shaped by both HGT and shared ancestry. ...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{diversity}} {{has always}} been associated with micro-evolutionary events such as horizontal gene transfer and DNA mutations. Such events influence the rapid evolution of bacteria {{as a result of}} the environmental conditions which they encounter. They further establish beneficial phenotypic effects that allow bacteria to specialize in new habitats. Due to the increase in number of bacterial genomic sequences, studying microbial evolution has been made possible, and the impact of micro-evolution on bacterial diversity is becoming more apparent. To gain biological information from this ever increasing genomic data, a variety of computational tools are required. This thesis therefore, focuses on the development and application of computational approaches to identify genomic regions of divergence which have resulted from horizontal gene transfer or small mutational changes. The first and major part of the thesis describes the application of DNA patterns, termed oligonucleotide signatures to identify horizontally acquired genomic regions in prokaryotes. These DNA patterns are demonstrated to differentiate between signatures of the core genome and those which have been acquired through horizontal transfer events. DNA patterns are further demonstrated to: reveal the distribution patterns of horizontally acquired genomic elements, determine their acquisition periods, and predict their putative <b>donor</b> <b>organisms.</b> The second part of the thesis focuses on the evaluation of modern short read sequence data of geographically unrelated Pseudomonas aeruginosa to study their intraclonal genomic diversity. The work described in the thesis was purely in silico driven and performed at Hannover Medical School and the Bioinformatics and Computation Biology Unit at the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Abstract Background Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT), {{a source of}} genetic variation, is generally considered to facilitate hosts' adaptability to environments. However, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of the transferred genes {{to the evolution of}} metazoan recipients is rare. Results In this study, based on sequence data accumulated to date, we used a unified method consisting of similarity search and phylogenetic analysis to detect horizontally transferred genes (HTGs) between prokaryotes and five insect species including Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera. Unexpectedly, the candidate HTGs were not detected in D. melanogaster, An. gambiae and T. castaneum, and 79 genes in Ap. mellifera sieved by the same method were considered as contamination based on other information. Consequently, 14 types of 22 HTGs were detected only in the silkworm. Additionally, 13 types of the detected silkworm HTGs share homologous sequences in species of other Lepidopteran superfamilies, suggesting that the majority of these HTGs were derived from ancient transfer events before the radiation of Ditrysia clade. On the basis of phylogenetic topologies and BLAST search results, donor bacteria of these genes were inferred, respectively. At least half of the predicted <b>donor</b> <b>organisms</b> may be entomopathogenic bacteria. The predicted biochemical functions of these genes include four categories: glycosyl hydrolase family, oxidoreductase family, amino acid metabolism, and others. Conclusions The products of HTGs detected in this study may take part in comprehensive physiological metabolism. These genes potentially contributed to functional innovation and adaptability of Lepidopteran hosts in their ancient lineages associated with the diversification of angiosperms. Importantly, our results imply that pathogens may be advantageous to the subsistence and prosperity of hosts through effective HGT events at a large evolutionary scale. </p...|$|R
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron <b>donors.</b> Chemotrophic <b>organisms</b> use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|R
