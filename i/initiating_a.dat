5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> member of the same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|For the {{two centuries}} prior to 1854, Japan had {{severely}} limited exchange with foreign nations, with the notable exceptions of Korea via Tsushima, Qing China via the Ryūkyūs, and the Dutch through the trading post of Dejima. In 1854, Commodore Perry opened Japan to global commerce with the implied threat of force, thus <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> period of rapid development in foreign trade and Westernization. In large {{part due to}} the humiliating terms of the Unequal Treaties, as agreements like those conveyed by Perry are called, the Shogunate soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical movement, the sonnō jōi ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").|$|E

5|$|Germanus was {{successful}} in winning the confidence of many soldiers, re-establishing discipline and defeating the mutineers at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in 537. With imperial control over the army restored, Solomon {{was sent back to}} Africa to replace Germanus in 539, again combining in his person the posts of magister militum and praetorian prefect (in the meantime, he had also been raised to the rank of patricius and named an honorary consul). Solomon further reinforced his control of the army by weeding out unreliable soldiers, sending them to Belisarius in Italy and to the East; by expelling all remaining Vandals from the province; and by <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> massive programme of fortification across the region.|$|E
5|$|Holkar {{was offered}} terms {{similar to those}} offered to Shinde; the only {{difference}} was that Holkar accepted and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, {{an official of the}} Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware {{of the power of the}} British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past. Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> battle in Mahidpur.|$|E
5|$|Italy began {{operations}} in the Mediterranean, <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> siege of Malta in June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred. The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining {{a foothold in the}} Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.|$|E

5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E

5|$|Prior to <b>initiating</b> <b>a</b> {{march on}} Fort Detroit, Clark used his own {{resources}} and borrowed from {{his friends to}} continue his campaign after the initial appropriation had been depleted from the Virginia legislature. He re-enlisted some of his troops and recruited additional men to join him. Hamilton waited for spring to begin a campaign to retake the forts at Kaskaskia and Cahokia, but Clark planned another surprise attack on Fork Sackville at Vincennes. He left Kaskaskia on February 6, 1779 with about 170 men, beginning an arduous overland trek, encountering melting snow, ice, and cold rain along the journey. They arrived at Vincennes on February 23 and launched a surprise attack on Fort Sackville. Hamilton surrendered the garrison on February 25 and was captured in the process. The winter expedition was Clark's most significant military achievement and became {{the basis of his}} reputation as an early American military hero.|$|E
