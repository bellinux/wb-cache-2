5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter.</b>|$|E

Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter.</b> Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
25|$|The {{beta decay}} of Pu-241 forms Am-241; the in-growth of {{americium}} {{is likely to}} be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter</b> (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of heat. The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include pyrochemical processes and aqueous/organic solvent extraction. A truncated PUREX type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation.|$|E
25|$|Industrial source waste {{can contain}} alpha, beta, neutron or <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters.</b> <b>Gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> {{are used in}} {{radiography}} while neutron emitting sources are used {{in a range of}} applications, such as oil well logging.|$|R
2500|$|Radioactive {{medical waste}} tends to contain beta {{particle}} and <b>gamma</b> ray <b>emitters.</b> It {{can be divided}} into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number of short-lived <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> such as technetium-99m are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include: ...|$|R
50|$|Norwegian {{authorities}} {{from the}} Marine Environmental Agency and Radiation Agency took several samples in August 2008 and no radiation was found. They checked for different radioactive substances including <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters,</b> plutonium, americium and strontium.|$|R
25|$|The short {{half-life}} of the isotope {{allows for}} scanning procedures that collect data rapidly. The isotope is also {{of a very}} low energy level for a <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter.</b> Its ~140keV of energy make it safer for use because of the substantially reduced ionization compared with other gamma emitters. The energy of gammas from 99mTc {{is about the same}} as the radiation from a commercial diagnostic X-ray machine, although the number of gammas emitted results in radiation doses more comparable to X-ray studies like computed tomography.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} also used for {{diagnostic}} purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter</b> used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera {{can be used to}} form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via bone scan).|$|E
500|$|... 232U {{by itself}} is not {{particularly}} harmful, but quickly decays to produce the strong <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter</b> 208Tl. (232Th follows the same decay chain, but its much longer half-life means that the quantities of 208Tl produced are negligible.) These impurities of 232U make 233U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using 233U as the fissile material. 233Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27days and a high cross section for neutron capture. Thus it is a neutron poison: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233U, {{a significant amount of}} 233Pa converts to 234U and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency. To avoid this, 233Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation, so that it only decays to 233U.|$|E
40|$|Radioimmunoassays for {{methotrexate}} are described, in-volving use of {{a rabbit}} antiserum to a conjugate of the drug and bovine serum albumin and the drug labeled with tritium, selenium- 75, or iodine- 125. Of the two <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters,</b> the 75 Se-labeled drug was prepared by the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, England and the 1251 -labeled drug in the laboratory, by the Chloramine T iodination technique. The stability of labels with both methods allows use of the faster, cheaper, and simpler gamma-counting techniques, with results available after 3 h. All three methods have acceptable sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and repro-ducibility, and are specific for methotrexate, with no sig-nificant interference from naturally occurring folates or leucovorin.

2500|$|Depending on {{the decay}} mode and the {{pharmacokinetics}} of an element (how the body processes {{it and how}} quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a radioisotope will differ. For instance iodine-131 is a short-lived beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter,</b> but because it concentrates in the thyroid gland, it is more able to cause injury than caesium-137 which, being water soluble, is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the alpha emitting actinides and radium are considered very harmful as {{they tend to have}} long biological half-lives and their radiation has a high relative biological effectiveness, making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure ...|$|E
50|$|Iodine-123 (I-123) is a <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter.</b> It is {{used only}} diagnostically, as its {{radiation}} is penetrating and short-lived.|$|E

25|$|The {{released}} nuclides can undergo bioaccumulation. Iodine-131, strontium-90 and caesium-137 {{are concentrated}} in milk of grazing cows; cow milk is therefore a convenient, sensitive fallout indicator. Soft tissues of animals can be analyzed for <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters,</b> bones and liver for strontium and plutonium, and blood, urine and soft tissues are analyzed for tritium.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the nuclear reactor in the Manhattan Project during the World War II made possible the creation of artificial radioisotopes for radiotherapy. Cobalt-60, produced by neutron irradiation of ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, is a high activity <b>gamma</b> ray <b>emitter,</b> emitting 1.17 and 1.33 MeV gamma rays with an activity of 44 TBq/g (about 1100 Ci/g). The main reason for its wide use in radiotherapy {{is that it has}} a longer half-life, 5.27 years, than many other <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters.</b> However the half life still requires cobalt sources to be replaced about every 5 years.|$|R
2500|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of this spectrum is typically {{used to determine the}} identity and quantity of <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> present in a gamma source, and is a vital tool in radiometric assay. [...] The gamma spectrum is characteristic of the gamma-emitting nuclides contained in the source, just as in optical spectroscopy, the optical spectrum is characteristic of the material contained in a sample.|$|R
50|$|The Radiation Dose Rate - {{the dose}} {{accumulated}} per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by {{measurement of the}} alpha radioactivity (the uranium and thorium content) and the potassium content (K-40 is a beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter)</b> of the sample material.|$|E
5000|$|... 99Tc is a <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter.</b> It is {{obtained}} on-site at the imaging center as the soluble pertechnetate which is eluted from a technetium-99m generator, and then either used directly as this soluble salt, or else used to synthesize {{a number of}} technetium-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals.|$|E

50|$|Both {{lead and}} bismuth are also an {{excellent}} radiation shield, blocking gamma radiation while simultaneously being virtually transparent to neutrons.

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} investigations into skeletal metabolism were carried out by George de Hevesy in the 1930s, using Phosphorus-32. In the 1950s and 1960s Calcium-45 was investigated, but as a beta emitter proved difficult to image. Imaging of positron and <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> such as Fluorine-18 and isotopes of strontium with rectilinear scanners was more useful. Use of Technetium-99m (99mTc) labelled phosphates, diphophonates or similar agents, as in the modern technique, was first proposed in 1971.|$|R
50|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of accidents, and in all atomic bomb blasts, the threat due to beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> is greater than that posed by the alpha emitters in the fallout. Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. Alpha particles have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.|$|R
5000|$|... 125I is a <b>gamma</b> <b>emitter</b> {{with a long}} {{half-life}} of 59.4 days (the longest of all radioiodines used in medicine). Iodine-123 {{is preferred}} for imaging, so I-125 is used diagnostically only when the test requires a longer period to prepare the radiopharmaceutical and trace it, such as a fibrinogen scan to diagnose clotting. I-125's gamma radiation is of medium penetration, making it more useful as a therapeutic isotope for brachytherapy implant of radioisotope capsules for local treatment of cancers.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{disadvantages}} of whole-body counting {{are that it}} can only be used for <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters,</b> except in special circumstances, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. On its own, it may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or daughter nuclides.|$|R
50|$|A well {{designed}} counting system can detect levels of most <b>gamma</b> <b>emitters</b> (>200 keV) at levels far below that which would cause {{adverse health effects}} in people. A typical detection limit for radioactive caesium (Cs-137) is about 40 Bq. The Annual Limit on Intake (i.e., the amount that would give a person a dose equal to the worker limit that is 20 mSv) is about 2,000,000 Bq. The amount of naturally occurring radioactive potassium present in all humans is also easily detectable. Risk of death by potassium deficiency approaches 100% as whole-body count approaches zero.|$|R
30|$|The Multi Crystal LB 2111 gamma counter is a compact, {{robust and}} easy-to-use {{instrument}} for most applications where gamma-emitting isotopes are used.

The principle of the analysis of free testosterone follows the basic principle of radioimmunoassay where there is competition between a radioactive and a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody binding sites. The amount of I 125 -labelled testosterone analog bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of the free testosterone present.|$|R
