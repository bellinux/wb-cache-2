500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he {{has no interest in}} seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as close as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

500|$|The two Sauber {{drivers were}} eighth and ninth with Heidfeld {{in front of}} Räikkönen; Heidfeld was happy with his {{position}} after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained {{that he had been}} blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa's car. Button took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth-place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella used his Benetton team's spare car because his race car developed an hyradulic failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that {{there was a lack of}} aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as [...] " [...] the worst qualifying session <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> on a circuit which love" [...] because he had brake balance and handling issues. Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team. Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car.|$|E
2500|$|Nechayev {{began to}} tell me his plans for {{carrying}} out a revolution in Russia in the near future. I felt terrible: it was really painful {{for me to say}} [...] "That's unlikely," [...] "I don't know about that". I {{could see that he was}} very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act – wasn't he the ringleader of the students? ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me... And what did I know of [...] "the people"? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.|$|E
2500|$|Flea {{also had}} plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his future solo career. Flea {{eventually}} abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill to former Minutemen bassist Mike Watt's debut solo album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. He also worked with Tori Amos and Michael Stipe on a track for the soundtrack to the 1995 Johnny Depp film Don Juan DeMarco. Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned {{whether or not the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: [...] "...the only way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> carrying on is if we got John [...] back in the band." [...] Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to heroin and crack cocaine left him on the brink of death. Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major {{contributions}} to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his [...] "new system of ideas". In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as [...] "the plausible impossible" [...] and [...] "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived {{the idea of using}} a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term [...] "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that [...] "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> of solid upper-class comforts." [...] In [...] "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the [...] "law" [...] appears in his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells (1933), ...|$|E
2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
