Renault begins as a collaborator with the Nazis who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is [...] "caught in the emotional struggle" [...] over which man she really loves. By the end, however, [...] "everybody is sacrificing." [...] Behlmer also emphasized the variety in the picture: [...] "it's a blend of drama, melodrama, comedy [...] intrigue".|$|E
500|$|He has, at times, been criticised for {{his passing}} ability. As well {{as not being}} able to channel his {{aggression}} into a more productive manner, he has also been criticised for his disciplinary record due to his tough tackling style and his lack of goalscoring since joining Celtic. The Daily Telegraph noted in the lead-up to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final that Brown had only scored six goals in the previous two seasons, but had received eighteen yellow cards and two red cards. After captaining Scotland to an away win over Poland in March 2014, the Scotland national manager described Brown as [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "He's ungainly in a way but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>what</b> all good midfielders do: pass the ball, keep it, move it on.

500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand is that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>what</b> he wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E
500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>what</b> I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E

[...] He [...] "does make mistakes", she conceded, but in the end, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>what</b> his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry's pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory's body from Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and selfless.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophical anarchists may {{accept the}} {{existence}} of a minimal state as an unfortunate, and usually temporary, [...] "necessary evil" [...] but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. As conceived by Godwin, it requires individuals to act in accordance with their own judgments and to allow every other individual the same liberty; conceived egoistically as by Max Stirner, it implies that [...] "the unique one" [...] who truly [...] "owns himself" [...] recognizes no duties to others; within the limit of his might, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>what</b> is right for him. Godwin opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present [...] "necessary evil" [...] that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated. Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable.|$|E
