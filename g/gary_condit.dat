5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit,</b> a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit.</b> Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the House Ethics Committee {{recommended}} that Traficant be expelled from Congress. On July 24 the House voted to expel {{him by a}} 420–1 vote. The sole vote against expulsion was Rep. <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit,</b> {{who at the time}} {{was in the midst of}} a scandal of his own and had been defeated in his reelection primary. Traficant was the first representative to be expelled since Michael Myers's expulsion in 1980 as a result of the Abscam scandal.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its mission}} {{to show that}} there is a [...] "strident liberal bias" [...] in the {{national}} news media, the MRC has produced a number of their own analyses and has offered as evidence the claims that news reporters use the [...] "conservative" [...] or [...] "Republican" [...] label to describe conservatives more often than they label liberals or Democrats, they have also said that when politicians are involved in scandal, their party affiliation is brought up more often when they are Republican than Democrat, for example they have said that Senator Robert Packwood's Republican affiliation was brought up in most reports about his sexual scandals, but Representative <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit's</b> Democratic affiliation was ignored when he had the same problem, that the media is sympathetic to Communism or [...] "dictators", that media coverage of global warming is biased in favor of environmentalism, and that the media focuses on covering the negative side of the Iraq war. In 1999, the MRC reported that the network news programs on ABC, CBS, and NBC largely ignored Chinese espionage in the United States during the Clinton administration.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, investigative {{journalist}} Dominick Dunne said on Larry King Live {{that he believed}} <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit</b> knew {{more information about the}} Levy case than he had been disclosing. Condit filed two lawsuits against Dunne, forcing him into an undisclosed financial settlement on one of them. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure dismissed the other suit that alleged slander, because [...] "The context in which Dunne's statements were made demonstrates that {{they were part of a}} discussion about 'speculation' in the media and inaccurate media coverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Chung {{made the}} jump to ABC News as a {{reporter}} on 20/20, and co-host of the Monday edition of the program alongside Charles Gibson.

2500|$|Condit sued Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne in late 2002 for $11 million, {{claiming}} that Dunne defamed him by suggesting he ordered Levy killed in 2001. Condit's attorney {{said that the}} libel lawsuit was based on comments Dunne repeated on national radio and television programs in December 2001, where he suggested Condit frequented Middle Eastern embassies for sexual activity with prostitutes and, during those times, {{he made it clear}} that he wanted someone to get rid of Levy. Condit's attorney said that Dunne's comments [...] "conveyed that <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit</b> was involved in her kidnapping and in her murder, that friends of <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit</b> had her kidnapped, put in an airplane and dropped in the Atlantic Ocean." [...] Dunne paid an undisclosed amount to settle that lawsuit in March 2005. [...] Dunne said he had been [...] "completely hoodwinked" [...] by an unreliable informant. [...] Subsequently Condit sued Dunne again, charging him with [...] "revivifying" [...] the slander in an appearance on Larry King Live in November 2005. [...] In July 2008 a federal judge dismissed the second lawsuit filed against Dunne.|$|E

2500|$|Chung's {{interviews}} were largely gentle, but often they were punctuated by a rapid-fire barrage of sharp questions. Despite this, her {{interviews were}} still {{widely recognized as}} being decidedly softer than those of other interviewers, such as Barbara Walters or Mike Wallace. Consequently, her interviews were often used as a public relations move by those looking to overcome scandal or controversy. Some of her more famous interview subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. Representative <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit,</b> whom Chung interviewed first after the Chandra Levy disappearance. Chung was the first journalist to interview basketball legend Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson after he went public about being HIV-positive.|$|E

In 1993, she became only the second female to co-anchor a network newscast as part of CBS Evening News. [...] She was removed in 1995 as CBS Evening News co-anchor after a controversial interview with a fireman, during rescue efforts at the Oklahoma City bombing, which seemed inappropriately combative, and her interview tactics to get Newt Gingrich's mother to admit her unguarded thoughts about Hillary Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|Affleck {{replaced}} Edward Norton, who {{had joined}} the project in September2007, but when the start of production was delayed due to Pitt's departure, a scheduling conflict developed for Norton with Leaves of Grass, which he was committed to film for Tim Blake Nelson early in 2008. Norton asked Universal Pictures if he could be replaced, and a deal was struck between the studio and the Endeavor Talent Agency (which represents Norton and Affleck) to enable Norton to leave the production amicably. Crowe had partly been attracted to the project because of Norton's involvement, but he and Affleck had [...] "so many touchstones in common" [...] he was fine with the recasting. Affleck visited Capitol Hill to research his role, meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York's 9th congressional district, {{and members of the}} Massachusetts congressional delegation. [...] In an April 2009 interview to promote the film, Affleck said he drew on the experiences of <b>Gary</b> <b>Condit,</b> Elliot Spitzer, and John Edwards while preparing for the role.|$|E
