5|$|The player acts as {{pilot for}} a cargo ship, {{performing}} space runs for various corporations. The ship is a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> {{made up of}} hexagonal tiles. The player places weapons and modules on the tiles in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards. Different structures have varying placement requirements, or may require more than one tile to be placed. For example, most weapons must be placed facing outward into empty space, while some require power to be supplied by an adjacent power source.|$|E
5|$|While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require {{players to}} {{memorize}} relatively lengthy and complicated button-input combinations often specific {{to only a}} particular character, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to run around freely on the stage. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with relatively larger, more-dynamic stages rather than a simple <b>flat</b> <b>platform.</b> Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.|$|E

25|$|The next {{substantially}} different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy {{in the late}} 19th century. Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> at {{the front end of}} the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models. These shoes also included a box—made of layers of fabric—for containing the toes, and a stiffer, stronger sole. They were constructed without nails and the soles were only stiffened at the toes, making them nearly silent.|$|E
25|$|A <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> {{was built}} around {{the peak of the}} Temple Mount, {{carrying}} the Dome of the Rock; the peak just breaches the floor level of the upper platform within the Dome of the Rock, {{in the shape of a}} large limestone outcrop, which is part of the bedrock. Beneath the surface of this rock there is a cave known as the Well of Souls, originally accessible only by a narrow hole in the rock itself; the Crusaders hacked open an entrance to the cave from the south, by which it can now be entered.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of ultrathin {{layers of}} CdS nanocrystals from cadmium arachidate Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film templates {{has been investigated}} by means of scanning force and scanning electron microscopies (SEM). Consistently with previous Brewster angle microscopy investigations, low resolution electron micrographs reveal a flat film surface characterized by steps due to {{the difference in the}} number of precursor layers. Scanning force microscopy (SFM) allows one to get information on the mesoscopic and atomic film structure. While in the range 1 - 10 mu m the film appears to be formed by a series of <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> often shaped like triangles and sometimes superorganized in larger needle-like structures, in the hundred nanometer scale an irregular granular structure appears. Finally, performing zooms onto <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> the CdS hexagonal lattice appears, revealing a lattice periodicity of 0. 42 nm, in agreement with the bulk value.

50|$|A step pyramid or stepped pyramid is an {{architectural}} structure that uses <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> or steps, receding {{from the ground}} up, to achieve a completed shape similar to a geometric pyramid. Step pyramids are structures which characterized several cultures throughout history, in several locations throughout the world. These pyramids typically are large and made of several layers of stone. The term refers to pyramids of similar design that emerged separately from one another, as there are no firmly established connections between the different civilizations that built them.|$|R
25|$|Several {{subsequent}} excavations {{followed through}} the 1960s, funded by generous {{grants from the}} National Geographic Society. On their return in 1967, Drucker and Heizer saw that, as others had already claimed, the vegetation previously covering the mound, {{as well as their}} own assumptions, had led to them previously publishing a completely wrong account of its shape. It was in fact a round fluted cone with ten ridges and depressions around it, rather than the sloping rectangle, leading to a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> that they had assumed. Possibly the shape was intended to match or represent the mountains nearby. They also obtained better carbon samples in order to achieve one of the key goals of the excavation of La Venta—proving that the Olmec were a distinct and separate culture that pre-dates the first Maya settlements.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other stork species, this stork is {{commonly}} found to nest on the ground, whereas many other stork species habitually nest at higher elevation. The nest always lies near to shallow water amongst tall grass and reeds, since aquatic organisms form {{the bulk of}} the nestlings’ diet. The maguari stork's nest is also unusual in extensively comprising grass and reeds. Common species used in nest fabrication include the reed Cyperus giganteus and the marsh grass Zizianopsis bonariensis, alongside other aquatic plants in the families Polygonaceae and Solinaceae. Ground nests found in the southern parts of the maguari stork's range are one meter high conical structures measuring 1.5-2.5m in basal diameter, tapering to a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> of 1-1.5m at the top. The nest rises up to two feet above {{the surface of the water}} and its location is largely treeless. Hence overall, the maguari stork's nest seems to more closely resemble that of cranes and screamers such as the southern screamer Chauna torquata than that of other stork species.|$|E
25|$|Washout toilets have a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> with {{a shallow}} pool of water. They are flushed by a {{jet of water}} from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An {{advantage}} of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Carpenters receive {{drafting}} {{from the}} technical director {{who uses the}} designers' renderings, models, and/or drafting of the set to create the technical drawings for the production. Working mainly with woods and metals, they use techniques that include woodworking and welding. They build set pieces, including some standard elements - <b>flats,</b> <b>platforms</b> and columns - as well as pieces of the stage. For example, a carpenter {{may be responsible for}} building stairs and ramps on and off of the performance area and for leveling the stage floor itself.|$|R
50|$|In the US the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) was {{produced}} in a version with a hooklift hoist gear named Load Handling System (LHS). The M1120 HEMTT LHS {{is the basis of}} the Palletized Load System using a <b>flatbed</b> <b>platform</b> to be mounted under ISO containers as a Container Handling Unit (CHU).

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the [...] "Western Wall". The wall was originally erected {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great, which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge <b>flat</b> <b>platform,</b> thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{pairs of}} black {{honeyeaters}} nest in groups or loose colonies, with males aggressively defending a small breeding territory against {{members of their}} own species as well as other honeyeaters. [...] Both members of the pair seem to be involved in selecting the nest site. The nest is usually situated low on a dead limb or in a fork of a small tree or shrub, though sometimes fallen timber including a fallen Callitris pine is chosen as the nest site. The female gathers nesting material close to the nest site, while the male is engaged in song flights, and she builds the shallow, open, cup-shaped nest from fine twigs, grass, and other plant material bound with spiderweb, lining it with grass, roots, fibre, horse hair, flowers or wool. As the young grow the nest can become flattened to a saucer shape, and may be an almost <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> by the time the chicks fledge.|$|E
500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a <b>flat</b> <b>platform.</b> That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E

In opposite corners (left and right to the audience) are ramps up to <b>flat</b> <b>platforms</b> on which robots start each match, colored for each alliance (called the home zone). On each platform is a home zone goal into which a bowling ball fits. In the corners without the platforms (front and back {{with respect to the}} audience) are the front and back parking zones. The two parking lot corners contain infrared beacons, which may guide the robots during the autonomous period. Between each home zone and the front parking zone is a protected area for each alliance.|$|R
50|$|Neotricula aperta is {{exclusively}} epilithic or epixylic (on rotting wood). Neotricula aperta {{is found}} only in shallow areas (typically 0.5 to 3 m deep) of the Mekong river {{and some of its}} tributaries. The snails are restricted to areas where the current is moderate (around 2 × 103 m3s−1), the water is clear and the bed rock forms (almost <b>flat)</b> <b>platforms</b> where agal aufwuchs is extensive. Such conditions exist only during the dry season in the lower Mekong (March to May) and so Neotricula aperta populations persist mostly by recruitment (from eggs laid on stones in the previous year) or re-colonization from other rivers, and transmission of Schistosoma mekongi is seasonal. Population density can reach up to 4734 snails per m².|$|R

2500|$|In the 18th year of {{his reign}} (20–19 BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on [...] "a more {{magnificent}} scale". [...] Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished {{in a year and}} a half. To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding. The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 CE, is sometimes referred to as Herod's Temple. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the Western Wall. These walls created a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.|$|E

50|$|A very obscure {{mortuary}} cult was {{fostered by}} the natives of the Easter Islands. Because almost no inscription survived from {{the height of}} the Easter Island culture and attempts to translate the ominous Rongorongo language were undertaken for a long time, the only knowledge about the mortuary cult of the Easter Islands is based on reconstructions. The only remains of the mortuary cults are the most famous at the same time: giant statues made of volcanic stone, called Moai, were placed on <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> bedighted with a wooden plaquette and crowned with a cylindric stone made of red stone. According to travelling reports from the 17th century the Moai were memorial statues of deceased kings, noblemen and priests. But at the visits of the first Europeans, most of the mortuary cults were already abandoned.|$|R
60|$|Phineas went before, {{springing}} up the rocks like a goat, {{with the boy}} in his arms. Jim came second, bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder, and George and Eliza brought up the rear. The party of horsemen {{came up to the}} fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were dismounting, to prepare to follow them. A few moments' scrambling brought them {{to the top of the}} ledge; the path then passed between a narrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which lay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full thirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle. Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the rock.|$|E
6000|$|A gondola is {{in general}} rowed only by one man, {{standing}} at the stern; those of the upper classes having two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence. In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests, not {{on the side of}} the boat, but on a piece of crooked timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot from the boat's side, and called a [...] "fórcola." [...] The fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated in its parts and curvature, allowing the oar various kinds of rests and catches on both its sides, but perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of the boat depends on the gondolier's being able in an instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> or deck behind it, and throws nearly the entire weight of his body upon the forward stroke. The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn the boat's head round to the left, as well as to send it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping the blade of the oar under the water on the return stroke, and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the water only an instant before it again plunges. A downward and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency given by the forward stroke; and the effort, after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious, though, as it adds some labor to the back stroke, rowing a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work, though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.|$|E

40|$|Relatively pure {{lacustrine}} carbonates {{referred to}} as marl are being deposited in Littlefield Lake, central Michigan, a hard-water lake with little terrigenous clastic influx. Thick accumulations of marl form both progradational marl benches along lake margins, and islands or lakemounts in the lake centre. Marl benches develop <b>flat</b> <b>platforms</b> up to 20 m wide in very shallow water and steeply inclined slopes, up to 30 °, extending into deep water. The <b>flat</b> landward <b>platform</b> is frequently covered by algal pisoliths while the upper portion of the lakeward-sloping bottom is overgrown by Chara which in the summertime becomes thickly encrusted with low-magnesian calcite. Marl islands are flat-topped features that formed over relict highs on Pleistocene drift which underlies the lake basin. These are fringed by marl benches identical to those found along lake margins. Marl benches are composed of four units: two thin facies deposited on the shallow-water bench platform and two thicker faces deposited on the bench slope developed in moderate water depths. These in turn overlie a fifth facies deposited in deep water. A coarsening-upward sequence is developed in these sediments {{as a result of}} both mechanical sorting, and primary production of carbonate sand and gravel in shallow water. In addition to facies sequences and size grading, trends upsection of increasing carbonate content and decreasing insoluble content may serve to identify temperate-region lacustrine carbonate deposits in the rock record...|$|R
50|$|A scenery shop or scene shop is a {{specialized}} workshop {{found in many}} medium or large theaters, {{as well as many}} educational theatre settings.

Commonly, a scene shop is also the location where most of the set painting is done, and is sometimes used to make props. Generally, the individuals who work in a scene shop are carpenters, although, in bigger shops, it is common for metalworkers to be employed for steel-construction set pieces which require welding and other machining.
