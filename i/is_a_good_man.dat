Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls deeply in love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage.

25|$|According to Mahabharata, when Bhishma has to pick Dhritarashtra's successor, he {{mentions}} to Vidura many of Duryodhana's positive qualities {{in comparison to}} Yudhishthira. Having spent so {{many years in the}} forest, Yudhishthira doesn't have Duryodhana's experience, military expertise, education, and courtly manners. Bhishma adds that Duryodhana is loved by the people, while Yudhishthira is an unknown quantity to them. However, Bhishma ultimately selects Yudhishthira, telling Vidura that in his heart, Duryodhana is a power-hungry, vitriolic individual, while at his core, Yudhishthira <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> who cares tremendously for his people.|$|E

500|$|Remender stopped writing Venom in August 2012 (after issue #22) {{to work on}} Captain America and {{the launch}} of Uncanny Avengers. He was {{replaced}} by Cullen Bunn, who had periodically worked as co-writer during Remender's term. The Venom character remained {{a member of the}} Secret Avengers, a series still written by Remender. In September 2012, Bunn said that Thompson would be moved from New York to Philadelphia from Venom #28. This relocation would allow the introduction of a new love interest, the superhero Valkyrie. Editor Tom Brennan explained [...] "His superhero career almost cost him everything...this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> with a troubled past who needed a fresh start...to take his next steps in becoming the hero he was born to be." [...] Marvel editor Stephen Wacker said the location change reflected Marvel's desire to expand the Marvel universe beyond New York City. Bunn's run introduced the new character Mania, one of Thompson's students who is empowered by part of the Venom symbiote. In August 2013, Marvel announced that Venom would end with issue #42 in October 2013. Bunn was informed of the decision while writing Venom #31-#38, which he stated gave him time to bring some plot threads to a conclusion, but having originally outlined thirty issues worth of stories, there would be some ideas left to be told.|$|E

Shortly after Ned's adoption is completed, Evie returns and reclaims her son after Ned's biological father reemerges, but ends up returning him to Peter and Gillian after her arrangements don't work out. Sometime after adopting Ned, Gillian gets pregnant and gives birth to another son, Walt. Things get rocky after Walt's birth and they separate for a while, even dating other people. Peter goes through a [...] "rebellion" [...] phase, trying to recall his teenage dreams, until he finds out his business is almost bankrupt. Soon after, he reconciles with his wife.|$|E
