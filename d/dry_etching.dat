50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>etching</b> {{refers to}} the removal of material, {{typically}} a masked pattern of semiconductor material, by exposing the material to a bombardment of ions (usually a plasma of reactive gases such as fluorocarbons, oxygen, chlorine, boron trichloride; sometimes with addition of nitrogen, argon, helium and other gases) that dislodge portions of the material from the exposed surface. A common type of <b>dry</b> <b>etching</b> is reactive-ion etching.

50|$|To remove {{existing}} native oxide layers {{wet chemical}} <b>etching</b> (HF clean), <b>dry</b> chemical <b>etching</b> or {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) with different types of crystals can be used.

30|$|The surface {{nanostructures}} were fabricated on {{all three}} glass compositions using a new technique that involves a combination of wet and <b>dry</b> chemical <b>etching.</b> Here, a 100 -nm silicon layer was deposited on the glass substrate using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Then, the samples were dipped into a solution containing 4.6  M hydrofluoric acid (HF) and 0.02  M silver nitrate (AgNO 3) [28] to deposit silver (Ag) nanoparticles on the silicon surface. The Ag nanoparticles acted as a mask for nanostructure formation during <b>dry</b> anisotropic <b>etching</b> by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Inductively coupled plasma was generated by perfluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8) and oxygen (O 2) gas (ratio 4 : 1), RF power of 100  W, ICP power of 200  W and pressure set to 13  mTorr.|$|R

50|$|In {{vertical}} slot-waveguides, {{the slot}} and strips widths {{are defined by}} electron- or photo-lithography and <b>dry</b> <b>etching</b> techniques whereas in horizontal slot-waveguides the slot and strips thicknesses are defined by a thin-film deposition technique or thermal oxidation. Thin film deposition or oxidation provides better control of the layers dimensions and smoother interfaces between the high-index-contrast materials than lithography and <b>dry</b> <b>etching</b> techniques. This makes horizontal slot-waveguides less sensitive to scattering optical losses due to interface roughness than vertical configurations.|$|E
