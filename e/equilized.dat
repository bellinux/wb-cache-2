40|$|Maize and {{soybeans}} were grown {{under field conditions}} on acid soil (pH in KCl = 3. 99). The field trail was conducted in spring 2004 as follows: a = ordinary fertilization, b = a + NPK- 1, c = a + NPK- 2, d = a + NPK- 3 and e = a + NPK- 4. The fertilizer NPK 10 : 30 : 20 was source of P and K (using in amounts 416, 1249, 2082, 2916 and 3748 kg/ha, for the treatments a, b, c, d and e, respectively. Nitrogen amount was <b>equilized</b> for all treatments by addition of adequate quatities of CAN (calcium ammonium nitrate: 27 % N) were used. The experiment was conducted in four replicates. By application of the ameliorative rates of NPK fertilizer, grain yields of maize significantly increased to level of 14 % compared to standard fertilization (12. 33 and 14. 00 t ha − 1, for the control and the second rate of NPK fertilization, respectively. Only {{the highest rate of}} NPK fertilizer resulted by significant increase of protein in grain. Residual response of soybean (the growing season 2005) to the fertilization was considerably higher compared to maize, because yields of soybeans were increased up to 32 %. Protein contents in soybean grain were independent on the fertilization, while oil contents were increased up to 0. 66 % compared to the control...|$|E

40|$|Ability of the {{originally}} designed SM- 2 stainless steel fuel elements to withstand static transverse pressure gradients of normal reactor operetion was investigated. Fourteen simulated original SM- 2 type fuel elements by Tungsten inert gas (TIG) and {{electric resistance welding}} processes were subjected to pressure gradients to 6 psi and measured for deflection during stress and distortion after stress. Tests provided a basis for selecting a reference SM- 2 fuel-element design and established a method of predicting maximum plate deflections under anticipated SM- 2 operating conditions. Results showed that TIG welded elements, slightly more prone to deflection, are preffered for SM- 2 application because they are less susceptible to weld failure and that fuel plate thickness {{is the most significant}} parameter in determining plate strength. It was also found that <b>equilizing</b> the length of the outer and inner plates significantly reduces maximum plate deflection and that effects of weld spacing and side plate thickness were not significant within the pressure range of the tests.

40|$|Though its {{earliest}} poems from this sequence were {{first published in}} 1982, Singularity Stereo {{is a work of}} total formal and thematic coherence. Short discursive poems punctuate meditations on science, the earth and harm like station announcements, or phasal interruptions in the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The texts combine nearly traditionalist pastoral modes – quotations from Spenser, wind rushing ‘through pear and apple gates’ – with a punishingly exact scientific lexicon. The poems twist along an S-shaped curve of immediacy and trace, refashioning of the idea of singularity, through a poetics which is both passionate and dispassionate about the physical world. Fisher's text insistently places aesthetic, scholarly and neural activity in the same frame as political violence. Thus the inquiry into the nature of eloquence (with the help of Milton) in ‘stamping sequence’ at once offers the prospect of an enriched relativism – ‘that any truth has many shapes’ – and betrays the utility of that relativism to the shape-shifters who ‘trip about at command’. Singularity Stereo broadcasts the difficulty of <b>equilizing</b> promise and critique, and the physical-phenomenological specifications for our time of the forms of ‘manifest hurt’ caused ‘in being’. ...|$|R
50|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2011-12 were {{set by the}} school board at 28.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's {{assessed}} value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account {{for the vast majority}} (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board of equalization <b>equilizes</b> the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.|$|R
