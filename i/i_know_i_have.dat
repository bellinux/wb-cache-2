5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the part of Blair, actress Leighton Meester, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel. She has {{described}} the character as multi-faceted, labeling her [...] "a {{little bit of everything}} which is pretty amazing." [...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!" [...] Meester's casting was described by Yahoo! as a star-making role which moved her [...] "into the pop culture vanguard," [...] while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.|$|E
60|$|Dimly and instinctively, as Jack went on, a faint {{sense of}} resentment and righteous indignation {{against the man}} with the white beard rose up vaguely in my mind by slow degrees. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been angry with him, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> defied him, but how or why as yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> not.|$|R

500|$|Schumacher and {{producer}} Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. [...] "There {{was a lot}} of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more family-friendly," [...] Schumacher explained. [...] "We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie and less torture and more heroic. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze's one-liner jokes in his two-star review of the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed the film [...] "killed" [...] the Batman film series, and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script. Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said, [...] "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should {{go down in history as}} the George Lazenby of the series." [...] However, Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
2500|$|Stieglitz {{certainly}} {{knew what}} he had achieved in these pictures. Writing about his Equivalents to Hart Crane, he declared: [...] "I know exactly what I have photographed. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done something {{that has never been}} done…I also know that there is more of the really abstract in some 'representation' than in most of the dead representations of the so-called abstract so fashionable now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of Smart's direct artistic {{stimulation}} came from, literally, {{a passing}} glance {{as he was}} driving: [...] "My paintings have their origins in a passing glance". [...] "Sometimes I'll drive around for months... despair, nothing, nothing, then suddenly I will see something that seizes me: a shape, a combination of shapes, a play of light or shadows and I send up a prayer because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the gem of a picture." ...|$|E

In November 2011, Sussex announced that Naved Arif had signed a new one-year contract with Sussex. Naved stated, [...] "I want {{to say thank you}} to Sussex for keeping faith in me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> so much more to give the team in 2012 and I aim to establish myself as a regular". Cricket manager, Mark Robinson said, [...] "I’m delighted that Naveed has agreed to come back for another year. Despite his age, he is still in many ways inexperienced. He is still learning and has got lots more to give." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{evidence}} given {{on the first}} day of the inquest into Kempton's death by her friend Rose Heinberg, Kempton was at the New Court Club in Percy Street with Heinberg, when a man called [...] "Micky" [...] told her that a Chinese man named [...] "Billy" [...] wanted to meet her. The four of them went by taxi to a Chinese restaurant in Regent Street. There Billy asked her to come outside and according to Heinberg, when Kempton returned her mouth was twitching. Heinberg asked if Kempton was eating something to which Kempton replied [...] "I have been drugged ... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been drugged, because a year ago, when I used to take drugs, my mouth used to twitch. I used to have to eat chewing-gum to make people think I was eating sweets." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barboza has a {{prolific}} and {{wide range of}} both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited {{in public and private}} galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. [...] He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. [...] Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. [...] In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, [...] "When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not how they look. [...] I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. [...] When they do that, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it." [...] Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command.|$|E
