25|$|Essex needed 299 to win, and {{had four}} {{sessions}} to do it. They lost Ravinder Bopara after 12 minutes, caught off Liam Plunkett, but Andy Flower and Alastair Cook forged a 72-run partnership before Durham medium-pacer Mark Davies struck and had Cook caught behind. At stumps on day three, Essex were 129 for 2. Lewis and Gareth Breese {{did a lot}} of bowling for Durham on the fourth day, totalling 65.1 of Durham's total of 100.1 overs, and after Ronnie Irani departed for 48, Durham limited the Essex partnerships to no more than 25. Andy Flower stood tall, however, spending six and a half hours at the crease to end with 132 not out - and his eighth-wicket partnership of 25 saw Essex cut the target to 10. Palladino hung <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Flower, contributing a single, and Essex won by two wickets.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth {{scored a}} quick 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had {{control over the}} Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which of course was pleasing to the home side.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth was {{the most}} rapid scorer for the Sabres, making 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres made a total of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. Alex Wharf took three wickets for Glamorgan, the most, but conceded 38 in three overs to be Glamorgan's most expensive bowler too. A highlight of Somerset's innings was the effort of their number 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before fifth- and sixth-change bowlers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and shared five wickets, leaving Glamorgan at 167 for 7. However, Alex Wharf hung <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Mike Powell, making 11 off five balls before he was caught off the sixth, and coupled with Powell's unbeaten 68 Glamorgan finished on a total of 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, that under Twenty20 Cup rules the team with the fewer wickets lost would win.|$|E

However, it was Worcestershire Royals who won the toss and batted first, Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki (coming in for Chris Gayle who retired hurt) adding 103 for the first wicket. Gayle returned when Solanki was dismissed, hitting 44, and 25 from Ben Smith helped Worcestershire to 227 for 5.

He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship.
