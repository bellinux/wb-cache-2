Introduction Synapses [Grimson 98] was an ambitious project funded under the fourth framework of EU projects. The project ran for three years and was completed in January 1999. The focus of the project was to collect data from a variety of heterogeneous data sources and federate them in an open, generic and secure way to form a well-defined Electronic Patient Record (EPR). In Synapses terms, the data sources from which the EPR takes its data are known as <b>Feeder</b> <b>Systems.</b> These <b>feeder</b> <b>systems</b> are autonomous and hig [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{coexistence}} of different information {{systems that are}} unable to communicate is a persistent problem in healthcare and in integrated home care in particular. Theory and methods: Physically federated integration is used for design of the underlying technical architecture to implement a mobile virtual health record for integrated home care. A user centered system development approach is followed during design {{and development of the}} system. Results: A technical platform based on a service-oriented approach where database functionality and services are separated has been developed. This guarantees flexibility with regard to changed functional demands and allows third party systems to interact with the platform in a standardized way. A physically federated integration enables point-of-care documentation, integrated presentation of information from different <b>feeder</b> <b>systems,</b> and offline access to data on handheld devices. <b>Feeder</b> <b>systems</b> deliver information in XML-files that are mapped against an ideal XML schema, published as an interface for integration with the information broker, and inserted into the mediator database.

2500|$|Many north-trending shear zones {{intersect}} iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. These zones {{range in}} width {{from less than}} [...] up to , and might maintain a larger area of weakness that was tectonically active over the past billion years. Evidence for early tectonism, likely related to volcanic activity, include the greater density of felsic dikes concentrated immediately around these zones. An example is the north-south trending Big Dan Shear Zone situated near the former garbage dump of Temagami. The felsic dikes near this zone are interpreted to represent a subvolcanic <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> to the overlying felsic volcanic rocks. It is probable that the dikes maintained a former zone of weakness now demonstrated by the shear zones. Renewed tectonic activity along the Big Dan Shear Zone is manifested by offset of clastic sediments east of the Ontario Northland Railway. This phase of tectonic activity displaced felsic dikes north of the exposed part of this shear zone. However, considerable displacement of the dikes at this location is unknown. The most recent phase of tectonic activity along the Big Dan Shear Zone resulted in the displacement of a Proterozoic dike composed of diabase, which intersects the zone. A similar abundance of felsic dikes are adjacent to Arsenic Lake just west of Highway 11, indicating similar repetitive tectonism also occurred along that structural zone. Therefore, the north-trending shear zones may have been active {{for at least a}} billion years.|$|E
