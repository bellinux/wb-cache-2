5000|$|Another equally {{important}} contributing influence is deindividuation, a psychological state characterized by partial or complete loss of self-awareness, diffused responsibility, and decreased concern {{about our own}} behavior resulting in the abandonment of norms, restraints and inhibitions due to the involvement in a group.( [...] Diener, E., Fraser, S. C., Beaman, A. L., & <b>Kelem,</b> R. T. (1976)) The individual loses their sense of self as they participate in the group's activities and choices. Deindividuation involves a loss of self-awareness which is essentially {{the degree to which}} one's attention is focused on the self, resulting in comparisons against meaningful standards. When spectators become deindividuated, their self-awareness decreases and they cease to compare their behavior against these social norms. The group's norms become their only focus, and therefore the social norms. Consequentially, situational forces are more influential. Without the comparison process of self-awareness, behavior {{is more likely to be}} inconsistent with attitude.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the experimental site of Wollo University {{with the objective of}} assessing the effect of different sowing depth on growth performance of Maize plant. There were six treatments which were replicated three times. The experimental was layed out in RCBD (randomized complete design). The treatments consisted of 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 12 cm sowing depth. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of depth of sowing on the growth performance of Maize plant (Percentage of plant emergence at 10 days after sowing, number of plant leaves at 15 days after emergence, plant height at one month after emergence and number of emerged plants after sowing by counting stand plants). Sowing at depth of 6 cm produced the tallest plant, highest number of leaves per plant, the plant emerged early with 100 % emergence. The deepest sowing depth showed poor performance in the parameters considered. Thus for similar agro ecologies of <b>Kelem</b> meda, it is better to apply 6 cm depth of sowing. However, the results of the experiment are only morphological parameters and did not include yield components due to limitation of time to accomplish the experiment. Thus the results will be assured, if similar research is going to be conducted in multi locations across seasons...|$|E
40|$|Although {{this book}} is not {{intended}} to be a festschrift, the opening chapter does highlight the contributions of one person: We show how the field of subjective well-being has been shaped and influenced by the efforts of Ed Diener. His impact has resulted not just from his own extensive body of empirical work, but also from his thoughtful and integrative review papers, his edited volumes, his wide-ranging collaborations with a large number of scientists around the world, his work with the popular press, and his success in training a substantial number of well-equipped PhD and postdoctoral students who have gone on to make their own contributions to the field of subjective well-being. In tracing Ed Diener’s contributions, we begin by noting that he had a suc-cessful research career before he turned to subjective well-being. In fact, prior to his work on positive characteristics, Ed Diener focused on some of the darker aspects of human nature. Before the 1980 s he worked primarily on the topic of deindividuation (e. g., Diener, Fraser, Beaman, & <b>Kelem,</b> 1976), the notion that people in a group would sometimes behave in ways that were against the values and morals of the individuals in the group, such {{as is often the case}} with lynch-ing, pillaging, gang rape, genocide and other autocracies committed by groups. The title of his dissertation, completed in 1975, was: “Prior destructive behavior, anonymity, and group presence as antecedents of deindividuation and aggres...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} of the difficult reproductive decisions faced by HIV-positive women. Studies in both resource-constrained and developed countries have suggested that many HIV-positive women continue to desire children {{in spite of their}} understanding of the possible risks that HIV poses. This study investigates the factors associated with fertility desire among HIV-positive women in Tigray region, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 964 HIV-positive women receiving HIV care in 12 health centers of Tigray region. In each health center, the number of study participants was allocated proportionally to the load of HIV-positive women in the chronic care clinics. A descriptive summary of the data and a logistic regression model were used to identify factors associated with fertility desire using odds ratios with a 95 % confidence interval and P-value of 0. 05. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty nine (45. 5 %) of the participants reported a desire to have children in the future. Eighty six percent of the women had given birth to at least one live baby at the time of study, with the median number of live births being 2 (Inter quartile range[*]=[*] 1, 3). Women in the age group of 15 - 24 years [AOR[*]=[*] 2. 64 (95 % CI: 1. 44, 4. 83) ] and 25 - 34 years [AOR[*]=[*] 2. 37 (95 % CI: 1. 60, 2. 4 3. 50) ] had higher fertility desire as compared to women in the age group of 35 - 49 years. Having no children [AOR[*]=[*] 25. 76 (95 % CI: 13. 66, 48. 56) ], having one to two children [AOR[*]=[*] 5. 14 (95 % CI: 3. 37, 7. 84) ] and disclosing HIV status to husband/sexual partner [AOR[*]=[*] 1. 74 (95 % CI: 1. 11, 2. 72) ] were all independently associated with fertility desire. CONCLUSIONS: Age, HIV disclosure status to husband/sexual partner, and relatively few live children were all found to influence HIV-positive women's fertility desire. Programmers and policy makers should consider the effects of these factors for HIV-positive women as they develop HIV/AIDS interventions.
