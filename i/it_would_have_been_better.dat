The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both {{the front and back}} covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly.

25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, had thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> if rival groups would eventually end the violence and sort out the dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions and blame to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E
25|$|Oberst (Colonel) Leibrock, {{commander}} of BRIR 6, {{had been taken}} prisoner; after the war, he published {{a report on the}} fate of the regiment. He wrote that the regiment had not been placed under the command of the 28th Reserve Division and 12th Division, until the British-French preparatory bombardment had begun, {{that there had been a}} lack of material to build dug outs and obstacles and the work could not be done in daylight. The regiment had been split, battalions assigned elsewhere and companies had been used piecemeal as reinforcements. On 1 July, the commander lost telephone communication with most of the regiment and had no control over the supply of food and ammunition. Leibrock wrote that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> to move the regiment into line as a unit and move neighbouring units sideways. The infantry had fought a determined defensive battle and had been overwhelmed. In 2005, Sheldon wrote that the 2nd Army had lost the initiative on the Somme during the preliminary bombardment, rather than on 1 July and that the defence of the area south of the Albert–Bapaume road was conducted in an atmosphere of crisis, in which units were thrown into battle to plug gaps rather than as formed units, which increased German loses.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{admitted}} that he preferred Brian Bolland {{to have been the}} novel's artist, complementing that McKean's art doesn't have [...] "the most terrifying expressions of the real." [...] Morrison liked Bolland's art in The Killing Joke, and initially wanted him to have drawn the comic, while criticizing McKean's choice of making the novel more abstract, adding that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> if it was more concrete. In Morrison's assessment, his writing and McKean's art styles clashed and competed with the novel's symbolic systems, which he said to be its greatest weakness.|$|E
500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{theme song}} for the {{international}} version {{of the game is}} [...] "My Hands", from British singer Leona Lewis' second album Echo; it was chosen to replace Final Fantasy XIIIs original theme song from the Japanese version, [...] "Kimi ga Iru Kara" [...] by Sayuri Sugawara. Square Enix President Yoichi Wada has stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but the lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song instead.

500|$|As a student, Grainger {{had learned}} to {{appreciate}} the music of Grieg, and came to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, [...] "quite different from Elgar, very original". After a lifetime interpreting Grieg's works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian's E minor Piano Sonata, Op. 7 as a [...] "Grieg-Grainger Symphony", but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged {{that he had not}} fulfilled Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist.

500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{painting}} were positive; one review called it [...] "beyond question {{one of the finest}} landscapes ever painted in this country", adding, [...] "Its artistic merits are in some respects unrivalled: and added to these it has the advantage of being a representative painting of a portion of the most sublime and beautiful scenery on the American Continent." [...] The painting won a prize at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American Pre-Raphaelites found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> [...] "if the marks of the brush had, by dexterous handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as it is, we have only too little geology and too much bristle." ...|$|E

I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others– and some Analog editorials I had read– that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks." [...] Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that [...] "rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} song in Glee first step at original music, including its production, lyrics, and the vocals of Lea Michele. However, common criticisms were that the song sounded like a cover of another song, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> suited for other artists Martin usually works with, such as Pink or Avril Lavigne. The song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became the cast's third top-ten hit to date. It reached number thirty-six on the US Adult Pop Songs chart, becoming their first song other than a Christmas song to appear on an airplay chart. Internationally, it reached the top thirty in at least five other markets. The song's performance was featured in the Glee episode [...] "Original Song" [...] which first aired on March15,2011, and included choreography and the group throwing confetti from slushie cups at the audience.
