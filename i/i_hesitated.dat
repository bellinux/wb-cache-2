2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

60|$|The abruptness of the {{proposal}} took me by surprise. <b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b>|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> {{and then}} {{repeated}} the words. Mr. Ravenor watched me keenly.|$|E
60|$|There {{are those}} who have blamed the man for that, but until I know my own courage better, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to join their number.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Gys, {{his voice}} quiet and pleasant. [...] "I don't blame you and I'm not offended. Do you wonder <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to meet strangers?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Madame de Klingenspohr, then," [...] replied <b>I,</b> <b>hesitating</b> somewhat, [...] "has grown rather--rather st-st-out?" [...] I {{could hardly}} {{get out the}} OUT, and trembled I don't know why as I asked the question.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> how to answer. To say {{the least}} of it, her request embarrassed me.|$|E
