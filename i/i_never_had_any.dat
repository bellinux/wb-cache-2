500|$|Blanchard {{was born}} on December 11, 1924 in McColl, South Carolina [...] His father was a doctor and had played college {{football}} at Tulane University and Wake Forest University. The Blanchards moved from McColl, South Carolina to Dexter, Iowa in 1929. [...] The Blanchards then moved to Bishopville, South Carolina two years later. [...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E
500|$|A fierce {{bidding war}} ensued, with Geffen Records A {{director}} Mark Kates signing Beck in December 1993 despite intense competition from Warner Bros. and Capitol. Beck's non-exclusive contract with Geffen allowed him an unusual amount of creative freedom, with Beck remaining free to release material through such small, independent labels as Flipside, which issued the sprawling, 25-track collection of pre-"Loser" [...] recordings titled Stereopathetic Soulmanure on February 22 the following year. By the time Beck released his first album for Geffen, the low-budget, genre-blending Mellow Gold on March 1, [...] "Loser" [...] {{was already in}} the top 40 and its video in MTV's Buzz Bin. [...] "Loser" [...] quickly ascended the charts in the U.S., reaching a peak of number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. Beck's newfound position of attention led to his characterization as the [...] "King of Slackers", as the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called [...] "slacker" [...] movement. Critics, feeling it the essential follow-up to Radiohead's [...] "Creep", found vacantness in the lyrics of [...] "Loser" [...] strongly associated with Generation X, although Beck himself strongly contested his position as the face of the [...] "slacker" [...] generation: [...] "Slacker my ass. I mean, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am tired}} of merry times, and don't care if <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> more!" [...] {{answered}} our pettish little Pandora. [...] "And, besides, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> do <b>have</b> <b>any.</b> This ugly box! I am so taken up with thinking {{about it all the}} time. I insist upon your telling me what is inside of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, we are cousins, Lord Embleton says, and you {{may call}} me Rosamond. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> cousins before,' {{interrupted}} the young lady.|$|R
2500|$|Edwards {{enrolled}} at Ohio State University and was Brown's roommate as he captained the Buckeyes freshman football team. After the season, however, {{he transferred to}} Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. At Wittenberg, he played as a center starting in 1928 and was {{the captain of the}} football team in 1929 and 1930. A tough player, Edwards did not like to wear a helmet, saying [...] "you skin your ears a little without them, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> trouble." [...] He won All-Ohio honors at Wittenberg and was named an honorable mention All-American in 1930. One of Edwards's most memorable games as a collegian came in 1928 against the Ohio Wesleyan Battling Bishops. In the last game of a season in which Wesleyan had a perfect record and beat football powerhouses Michigan and Syracuse, Edwards kicked an extra point as time expired and gave Wittenberg a 7–6 victory. Grantland Rice, a prominent sportswriter of the time, called him the best center in college football. Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune named him an All-American.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1994, DGC reissued [...] "Loser" [...] on CD and cassette, and Geffen began heavily {{promoting}} the single. Bong Load, having retained {{the rights to}} release Beck's songs on vinyl {{due to the nature}} of Beck's contract with DGC, re-pressed the 12" [...] single in larger quantities than before. [...] "Loser" [...] quickly ascended the charts in the US, reaching a peak of number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was certified gold by the RIAA and sold 600,000 copies domestically. The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. [...] "Loser's" [...] worldwide success shot Beck into a position of attention, and the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called [...] "slacker" [...] movement. Beck refuted this characterization of himself, saying, [...] "Slacker my ass. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear no. <b>I</b> find <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> {{words about}} the money. But there's that one question. There's a young Mr. Stanbury has gone down, as knows all about it. What's he up to?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{which we}} all laughed, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> attempt at beauty, except, I believe, good hair and teeth, and a habit of looking good-humoured.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to the women," [...] {{said the}} rector, [...] "I have to {{acknowledge}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> experience with the militant type of which you speak." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> ambition, and now, I trust I {{have almost}} as little vanity.|$|E
60|$|DUKE. [Wagging {{a playful}} finger at him.] Ah, prejudice, prejudice! You doctors, you know! Well, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> myself.|$|E

6000|$|... "Both {{my father}} and I, you see," [...] Letitia observed, [...] "are a little old-fashioned. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> idea of marriage, except with some one whose family I knew all about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Archie and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{trouble in}} leaving Boston, or of coming into {{it when we}} were so minded, and we will set you {{on the road to}} Cambridge without turning a hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean, Mad?" [...] he said, putting his arm affectionately round her waist. [...] "And {{what is it}} that I mean? Come; you and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> secrets;--you always say so when you want to get at mine. Tell me what it is that I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A tick," [...] {{explained}} Ginger. [...] "A rotter. He {{was pretty}} generally barred at school. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> use {{for him at}} all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I don't, Florence, or I {{would tell}} you. Of course Mr. Saul has asked me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> secret {{with you about}} that--have I?" ...|$|E
60|$|The peacock's {{feathers}} are marvelous. I am {{very glad}} to see them. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> of their downy ones before. My compliments to the bird, upon them, please.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{know what}} you mean about music; I feel so," [...] said Maggie, {{clasping}} her hands with her old impetuosity. [...] "At least," [...] she added, in a saddened tone, [...] "I used to feel so when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> music; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> now except the organ at church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I do, really; but, at any rate, 'they' {{are not always}} mind-readers--that I have proved very conclusively. In all my {{experience}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> satisfactory evidence of the clairvoyance of these manifesting intelligences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t know {{anything}} about them, Lady Cochrane; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> little brothers and sisters. Of course some of my school-fellows had them, and it always {{seemed to me that}} they were jolly little things when they were in a good temper.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you draw}} {{ahead of me}} there, for <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any.</b> But come, friend, let me know the trouble, that I may see if {{it may not be}} mended." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{reason to}} doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Judge Whipple, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other {{home than}} right in, this house. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> other {{pleasure}} than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin' to show 'em gratitude. He took {{me into his}} house and cared for me {{at a time when}} I {{wanted to go to the}} devil along with the stevedores when I was a wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation. Judge, I'd a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in here and tell him I'd fight for the North." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The law {{has many}} outposts," [...] Peter Ruff said. [...] "One can thread one's {{way in and}} out, if one knows the ropes. I don't like the man, but he {{introduced}} me to his tailor. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> clothes like those he has made me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{speak from}} knowledge, only from hope. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> luck--I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{stayed in a}} {{dangerous}} house. The places I go to are always as safe as Charing Cross. I want to see--whatever there is, the regular thing. Is there a ghost here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not blame}} you for your suspicion," [...] he said calmly, [...] "although I {{can assure you that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> idea of <b>having</b> you watched. It is not a course which could {{possibly}} have suggested itself to me, even in my most unhappy moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so have I," [...] cried Locker, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> luck {{in fishing}} and--some other things. I am vilely unlucky. I expect that's because I don't {{know how to}} fish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't do that! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> trouble {{before and}} I don't want it now. I'll help you all I can-- {{if what you}} say its true, and that man is your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|Something like a sob {{broke from}} Pinkerton. [...] "Tell him," [...] he gasped--"I can't speak this language, though I {{understand}} a little; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> proper education--tell him I {{am going to}} punch his head." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was good}} to see how quickly the pretty purses were out, how generously each gave of its abundance, and what hearty applause broke from the girls, as Belle laid down her gold thimble, saying with an April face, [...] "There, take that; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> money, somehow it won't stay with me, but I can't let the plate pass me this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on, without {{regarding}} her: [...] "I {{have always}} {{made it a}} rule, as far as business went, to keep my own affairs entirely in my own hands. I fix the hours, and I fix the wages, and I fix all the other conditions, and I say plainly, 'If you don't like them, 'don't come,' or 'don't stay,' and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Christminster? Oh, well, out by there yonder; though I've <b>never</b> bin there--not <b>I.</b> I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{business}} {{at such a}} place." ...|$|R
