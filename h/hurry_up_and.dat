5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E

25|$|The British {{liaison officer}} Edward Spears later wrote that Lanrezac's {{reputation}} as an academic lecturer made him “the star turn” of the French Army. The British commander Sir John French, at his meeting with Joffre on 16 August, was advised to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> join in Lanrezac’s offensive, as he would not {{wait for him to}} catch up. On 16 August, in exchange for the loss of XI Corps, Joffre transferred XVIII Corps to Lanrezac. Lanrezac received three reserve divisions, containing men from Bordeaux, Gascony and the Basque Country, and two extra divisions of French settlers from Algeria.|$|E
25|$|York {{realized}} his column was badly exposed because of Bussche's defeat and Kinsky's lack of progress. He appealed to Emperor Francis to allow his column {{to pull back}} to Lannoy. Permission was denied. Instead, Mack ordered Charles to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> assumed Kinsky would do the same. In fact, Charles had an epileptic seizure and his staff refused to disturb him. In the night, Mack sent Charles orders to drop off 10 battalions and 20 squadrons to observe Lille and move with Kinsky to Lannoy so as to cover York's left flank. In the absence of their army commander Jean-Charles Pichegru, the French generals - Souham, Souham's chief of staff Jean Reynier, Moreau and Jacques MacDonald - met the crisis resolutely. Acting commander Souham instructed Moreau to hold off Clerfayt while his own and Bonnaud's divisions counterattacked the Coalition columns under Otto and York. Meanwhile, André Drut's division near Douai was asked to mount a diversion against Charles' column.|$|E

According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been around , you could tell he's got the bug to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> put this record out. He wants to get back out here and give the people that. He's got that itch."

500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Rural Juror" [...] {{was filmed}} in early November 2006. Regarding the episode's title, Tina Fey {{explained}} that [...] "it {{came out of}} a discussion in the writers' room" [...] when she asked, [...] "you know what two words I cannot pronounce properly?" [...] After a few abortive efforts by Fey's co-writers, who also made [...] "rural juror" [...] sound akin to [...] "ruhhr-juhhrr," [...] everyone was so pleased that [...] " [...] wanted to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> get it on the air before someone else did." [...] Jenna's film, The Rural Juror, was first mentioned three episodes earlier, in [...] "Tracy Does Conan", and referenced several times later. A running joke throughout the series was the difficulty in pronouncing the film's title, so that everyone thought it was called something different. Throughout the episode, the film was called [...] "Roar Her, Gem Her" [...] by Liz; and also [...] "Oral Germ Whore" [...] and [...] "Roaring Junior" [...] by Pete. This episode also features the first mention of Mitch Lemon (Andy Richter), Liz's brother.

Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to <b>hurry</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self if he decides to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E
