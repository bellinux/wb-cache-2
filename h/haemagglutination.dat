25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Up until this time, viruses had only been grown in plants and animals, but in 1906, Ross Granville Harrison (1870–1959) invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E Steinhardt, C Israeli, and RA Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, HB and MC Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production. In 1941–42, George Hirst (1909–94) developed assays based on <b>haemagglutination</b> to quantify a wide range of viruses as well as virus-specific antibodies in serum.|$|E

50|$|The {{hemagglutination}} assay (or <b>haemagglutination</b> assay; HA) and the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI or HAI) {{were developed}} in 1941-42 by American virologist George Hirst as methods for quantitating the relative concentration of viruses, bacteria, or antibodies.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the <b>haemagglutination</b> activity domain is a conserved protein domain {{found near}} the N terminus {{of a number}} of large, repetitive bacterial proteins, including many proteins of over 2500 amino acids. A number of the members of this family have been designated adhesins, filamentous haemagglutinins, haem/haemopexin-binding protein, etc. Members generally have a signal sequence, then an intervening region, then the region described in this entry. Following this region, proteins typically have regions rich in repeats but may show no homology between the repeats of one member and the repeats of another. This domain is suggested to be a carbohydrate-dependent <b>haemagglutination</b> activity site.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} tests for the {{presence}} of BFDV are available: standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR) which can detect the virus in extremely small quantities, whole-genome sequencing, histology, immunohistochemical tests, and quantitative <b>haemagglutination</b> assays.|$|E
50|$|As {{clinical}} signs are fairly nonspecific and bovine enterovirus is ubiquitous in cattle populations, other causes of disease must {{be ruled out}} before diagnosing enterovirus {{as the cause of}} disease.

50|$|Diagnosis of aviadenovirus is by histopathology, {{electron}} microscopy, viral {{isolation and}} ELISA. In addition, virus antigen {{can be detected}} double immunodiffusion. Postmortem examination may reveal a variety of clinical signs relating directly to the organ affected.

These have varying degrees of efficacy.|$|E
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} {{relies on}} viral isolation and characterization.

50|$|Blue {{eye disease}} {{outbreaks}} can happen {{throughout the year}} but are most common during spring and summer months of April to July. The mortality rate usually rises and falls and between a two- to nine-week time frame. After the epidemic subsides, no more cases occur unless new susceptible pigs are introduced into the farm. In severe outbreaks of the disease a presumptive diagnosis can be made. Serological testing via virus neutralization and <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition testing can be performed to diagnose the disease. Virus isolation from tissue samples is also possible.|$|E

50|$|On August 6, 2013, the British Medical Journal {{released}} {{the results of}} epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients were infected with avian H7N9 in March 2013 and later died in April and May. A 60-year-old man became infected after an exposure to poultry and his daughter, {{who had not been}} exposed to poultry but had cared for her ill father, became infected as well. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty-three close contacts of the infected patients did not become ill and they all tested negative for <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition antibodies specific for avian H7N9. It was concluded that the infection of the daughter probably resulted from close contact with her father during unprotected exposure, suggesting that the virus was able to transmit from person to person. However, the researchers consider that the transmissibility of the virus remains limited and non-sustainable.|$|E
5000|$|Taylor-Robinson et al. {{identified}} and named M. orale in 1964 after isolating {{it from the}} oral cavity of a child at a Washington hospital and three servicemen stationed in North Carolina. Taylor-Robinson et al. cultured the organism under anaerobic conditions on PPLO agar and broth. The resulting colony growth had a [...] "fried egg" [...] appearance when cultured on solid PPLO agar. PPLO is stands for [...] "Pleuropneumonia-like organisms" [...] and was originally designed for growth of parasitic bacteria found in the respiratory tract of cattle; it is now known that these bacteria were Mycoplasma species. PPLO agar is used for isolation and growth of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species; it contains beef heart infusion, yeast extract, phenol red, sodium chloride, the antibiotic Polymyxin B, the antifungal Amphotericin B, the antibiotic Penicillin, deionized water, and horse serum.

[...] He became Director of the Institute upon the sudden death of Dr James Blakelock in August 1955 and held this position until 1970. [...] Manning started the New Zealand Reference Culture Collection (NZRCC) at the Institute in 1955. [...] This involved establishing and running both the general and reference laboratories for bacteriology and virology with a special interest in antibiotic sensitivity methods and a <b>haemagglutination</b> test for toxoplasmosis. [...] The collection was later designated as the national repository of organisms of national interest. The bacteriologist Sydney Josland worked under the direction of Manning at the Institute. Manning undertook a World Health Organisation Fellowship in 1966 and studied advances in laboratory organisation and methods. [...] Between 1970 and 1982, Manning was the Consultant Medical Microbiologist at Wellington Hospital.

5000|$|In humans, P. skrjabini infections {{can result}} {{in a wide variety of}} symptoms, {{rendering}} it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. [...] Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests. [...] Radiology, for example, can pick up on P. skrjabini's migration to ectopic places like the brain. [...] Serological or immunological tests including intradermal test, immunodiffusion, indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. [...] The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. [...] Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. [...] Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. [...] Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. [...] Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. [...] The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. [...] P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. [...] Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death. [...] Surgery may be occasionally necessary for patients with cerebal or pleural paragonimiasis.|$|E
40|$|Reverse passive <b>haemagglutination,</b> a novel microtitre based assay, was {{compared}} with the Streptex (Wellcome UK) latex slide agglutination kit for streptococcal grouping in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Three hundred and fifty two extracts from 349 consecutive primary isolation plates were assayed by both methods. Reverse passive <b>haemagglutination</b> gave identical grouping results for 98. 0 % of the 345 streptococci identified by Streptex, and the kappa coefficient of agreement between the methods for all 352 extracts tested was 0. 973. Cross reactions with Listeria spp seen with Streptex were not found by reverse passive <b>haemagglutination.</b> In the reverse passive <b>haemagglutination</b> method 11 streptococci could be grouped on each 96 -well plate and most reactions were stable for at least 30 minutes. Reverse passive <b>haemagglutination</b> is more rapid to perform than latex slide agglutination when many organisms are to be grouped, and the patterns of <b>haemagglutination</b> are easily recognised. If the method was taken into routine use in a diagnostic laboratory, the persistence of reverse passive <b>haemagglutination</b> reactions would enable grouping results to be checked for quality control purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of various concentrations of human γ-globulin (HGG) employed to sensitize tanned sheep erythrocytes on <b>haemagglutination</b> titres with various {{early and late}} mouse and rabbit antisera to HGG has been studied. The concentration of HGG employed to sensitize tanned erythrocytes which gives the highest <b>haemagglutination</b> titres with early, mercaptoethanol-sensitive antibodies was not optimal for obtaining highest <b>haemagglutination</b> titres with late, mercaptoethanol-insensitive antibodies. Similar results were obtained with heavy and light sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation fractions of a late and early rabbit antiserum. These findings may account for past discrepancies and should be considered when employing the <b>haemagglutination</b> test to detect early and late antibodies...|$|E
