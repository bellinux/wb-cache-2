25|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Triplane was {{its light}} armament. Contemporary Albatros fighters were armed with two guns but most Triplanes carried one synchronised Vickers machine gun. Efforts to fit twin guns to the Triplane met with mixed results. Clayton & Shuttleworth built six experimental Triplanes with twin guns. Some of these aircraft saw combat service with Nos. 1 and 10 Naval Squadrons in July 1917 but performance was reduced {{and the single}} gun remained standard. Triplanes built by Oakley would have featured twin guns, an <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> which severely delayed production.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to {{changing}} customer demand {{and development of}} new technologies, manufacturing companies have to implement <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> in manufacturing systems. Planning and control of these <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> is a key task for the company because of the involved costs and time exposure. To improve the organization of several <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> in manufacturing systems, methods of production planning and control are evaluated which can support the planning and control of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes.</b> The purpose of the paper is to introduce existing methods for production planning and control in the planning and control of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> in manufacturing systems. In the first step, the tasks of production planning and control and tasks {{for the implementation of}} <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> are listed. The handling of several parallel <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> is of particular importance. The tasks required for pre-selection, detailed planning and control of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> are analyzed. In the second step, these tasks are compared with tasks from the production planning and control on similarities. Furthermore, methods to support these tasks will be considered. In the third step, methods are exemplarily investigated to requirements and usability for the implementation of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes.</b> With the Support of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> in manufacturing systems by production planning and control method, proven existing methods can enhance the <b>engineering</b> <b>changes.</b> Knowledge about relationships in manufacturing systems can be transferred from production planning and control and optimize the implementation of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>changes</b> {{are common}} in {{manufacturing}} industries. <b>Engineering</b> <b>changes</b> can be found from the conception of the project until its culmination. In general, <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> are difficult to quantify. <b>Engineering</b> <b>changes</b> vary from design changes up to production changes. The management of these changes normally ends up in variation orders and is time consuming. In the Marine Industry, they are widely recognised, but hardly researched and quantified. The approach {{to develop a new}} tool is necessary to understand not only the management of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes,</b> but also the impact quantification on the project overall. The research to develop a new tool consists on developing case studies to implement a powerful methodology in live projects. The integration of different techniques from other industries that widely recognise the management of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> makes an opportunity to quantify <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> through this methodology. The new methodology includes coverage, impact representation, decision making process, lean improvement and analysis from the experts. The impact representation and the integration of tracking mechanisms are a key tool for researchers and practitioners to make decision in marine projects.

Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.|$|E

Conversely, in a design environment <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> are unavoidable and need to be effectively coordinated because they may become costly for a company in product recalls and reputational damage. They can however be viewed as a cost benefit as contributors to optimisation of product quality. In this study, <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> were examined as enablers to collaborative product design where the study was undertaken in the land systems sector of defence in South Africa. The sector is faced with defence cuts resulting in direct and indirect job losses across the supply chain. An exploratory study was conducted where the constraints to design performance were evaluated. The applicability of the data and process orientated information exchange models were explored on the extent they influence the speed of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes.</b> The outcome was a model that can be used as an evaluation and decision making tool for companies conducting collaborative strategy with emphasis on <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> and information flow.
