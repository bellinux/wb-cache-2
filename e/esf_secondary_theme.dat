50|$|The {{development}} involves significant re-working of a motif {{from the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>theme.</b> The motif is inverted, and {{passed through a}} series of remote keys. Unusually for a late Haydn work, the recapitulation involves few surprises. It reprises the principal and <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> in the tonic before a short coda.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} automatically creating a content-based index of musical scores. The goal is to capture the themes, or motifs, that appear in the music. The method was tested by building an index of 25 orchestral movements from the classical music literature. For every movement, the system captured the primary theme, or {{a variation of the}} primary theme. In addition, it captured 13 of 28 <b>secondary</b> <b>themes.</b> The resulting index was 14 % {{of the size of the}} database. A further reduction of 2 % is possible; however, this discards <b>secondary</b> <b>themes.</b> A listening experiment using five orchestral movements showed that people can reliably recognize <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> after listening to a piece of music–therefore, it may be necessary to retain <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> in a score index. 1...|$|R

25|$|As {{well as the}} six Core Objectives, a <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> for IMD {{is usually}} {{suggested}} by world coordinators such as peace in 2002, men's health in 2003, healing and forgiveness in 2007, positive male role models in 2009 and 'our children's future' in 2010. It is not compulsory to adopt these <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> and participants are welcome to establish individual themes to suit local needs and concerns.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} area {{begins in}} measure 108. The initial <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is in B minor and includes rhythmic similarities {{to the initial}} primary theme (y and z). In measure 120 the second <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> enters in B major. It is a lyrical theme presented in the oboe. This section begins pianissimo and gradually crescendos into the closing section in measure 161, which is also in B major.|$|R
50|$|The third theme {{introduces}} the {{mother with a}} suspense theme in b minor which makes the mood even more sad. Again her theme starts with three notes, though {{the rhythm of the}} notes is turned around. The suspense is formed by the chromatism in the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme.</b> Later on Dvořák uses these two themes the other way around, as if the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> becomes the primary, and primary the secondary.|$|R
50|$|As is {{conventional}} in Classical concerto form, in the recapitulation the soloist {{and orchestra}} are united, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is altered {{to stay in}} the tonic. As the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> comes to a close, the clarinet has another chance to improvise briefly, and this time leads the canonic material that follows. The Alberti bass and arpeggios over diminished chords for the soloist recur before the movement ends in a cheerful final orchestral ritornello.|$|R
50|$|The first {{movement}} is noted for the timpani {{roll in the}} first bar {{that leads to a}} dramatic piano flourish, which leads to the main theme. Then the key changes in C major, for the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme.</b> Later, the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> appears again in the recapitulation, but in A major. The movement finishes with a virtuosic cadenza and a similar flourish as in the beginning. The {{movement is}} in the Sonata form.|$|R

5000|$|The {{pitches and}} form of tonal music are {{organized}} hierarchically, all pitches deriving their importance from {{their relationship to}} a tonic key, and <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> in other keys are {{brought back to the}} tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme. Susan McClary connects this specifically in the sonata-allegro form to the feminist hierarchy of gender (see above) in her book Feminine Endings, even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called [...] "masculine" [...] and <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> [...] "feminine." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in the Russian movie Ballad of Siberia (Сказание о земле Сибирской), performed by actor Vladimir Druzhnikov, being a <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> song.|$|R
50|$|The scherzo is in a {{compound}} meter - 12/8 and 4/4, and in sonata form (without development). It begins with strings in a fast, exciting motif playing semiquavers against a woodwind 4/4 meter. It {{leads to the}} E major <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> in the exposition beginning with clarinet solo with string accompaniment. The opening theme reappears, now the first theme in the recapitulation, which later leads to the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme,</b> but this time in G major. The movement ends with a coda triumphantly, almost as a deceptive finale.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> {{appears in}} measure 70 in the dominant, A major, and {{comprises}} a descending triplet figure. The development section (measures 139-318) reverses {{the order of}} themes, first exploring the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> and then the primary theme, frequently with imitation. [...] The recapitulation is fairly straightforward. The piece concludes with a fiery coda beginning with a fugue section on the main theme and a couterpoint theme in quavers, with several homophonic passages that feature the brass and present the primary theme at half the speed. The symphony closes solidly with a tutti fortissimo statement.|$|R
5000|$|King George V School (...) , often {{shortened}} to [...] "KGV" [...] {{and pronounced}} [...] "K-G-Five" [...] (V is a Roman numeral) is a co-educational international secondary independent {{school of the}} English Schools Foundation (ESF), located in Ho Man Tin, Hong Kong. The school has 1740 students {{and is one of}} the oldest schools in Kowloon. Students take IGCSEs/GCSEs followed by the International Baccalaureate Diploma or the British BTEC programme. There is a Learning Support Centre (LSC) for students with learning difficulties. The campus has an area of 10.2 acres (41,000 m2). The school is one of three <b>ESF</b> <b>secondary</b> schools in Kowloon and the New Territories, the others being Sha Tin College and Renaissance College.|$|R
5000|$|To {{complement}} {{the previous two}} lighter movements, the fifth returns to {{the seriousness of the}} second movement. Again, like the second movement, the main theme relies heavily on the semi-tone interval. However, the additional pitch resources of this movement permit the construction of two trichords related by a tritone. The tritone becomes an extremely important interval in this movement, as it is introduced as part of the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> in the left hand and forms the basis for the parallel harmonies heard as both accompaniment to the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> and in the return of the main theme at MM 22. After this, Ligeti introduces a bell-like tolling on the pitches of G and A which continues to interrupt the fragments of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> as they fade {{toward the end of the}} movement. The movement concludes as the [...] "bell" [...] continues to toll in low octave G's, growing to a triple forte.|$|R
50|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> {{all have}} {{basically}} the same elements: the left hand playing legato arpeggiations of chords, while the right hand plays staccato chordal melodies, interspersed with multiple grace notes.|$|R
50|$|This {{movement}} {{is the only}} true scherzo found in Brahms' symphonies. It is in sonata form with foreshortened recapitulation and with the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> nearly absent {{in the development and}} coda.|$|R
50|$|This {{movement}} is in ternary form (A-B-A) with A being a scherzo in C minor (with a <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> in C major and E-flat major) and B being a trio in C major.|$|R
5000|$|The first movement, in sonata form, opens energetically with {{contrasting}} {{loud and}} soft phrases. The theme is angular in shape, both in its rising arpeggios and its dotted rhythm. The exposition lasts from mm. 1-105. The primary theme, a modified sentence structure, lasts from mm. 1-30. The transition, which is separately thematized {{and provides a}} quiet contrast, is in two parts and lasts from mm. 31-55. The <b>secondary</b> <b>theme,</b> which is accompanied by an Alberti bass, lasts from mm. 56-75 and ends with the essential exposition closure. The closing section, in two parts, quotes both <b>secondary</b> and primary <b>themes.</b> The development (after Darcy/Hepokoski's Sonata Theory) is half-rotational and divides into pre-core and core sections (after William Caplin); it lasts from mm. 106-168. The retransition, mm. 158-167, leads into the recapitulation. The recapitulation is at mm. 168-284, 11 measures longer than the exposition. The exposition's transition is altered harmonically in the recapitulation. Initially, the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is stated in F major (predominant), a [...] "false start", before being stated in tonic C minor. The <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is also expanded from the exposition. The essential structural closure is in m. 253.|$|R
50|$|Starting from 2005, one of {{the newest}} {{participating}} international pavilions is named the 'guest of honour', and is a kind of <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> of the fair. Australia was the guest of honour for 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{movement}} {{opens with}} the main theme, which consists of two contrasting parts—the first is strong in character {{and the second is}} more lyrical. The transition to the relative major has elements of the head of the main <b>theme.</b> The <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> contrasts the main theme by being very subtle in nature, and has a dance-like rhythm. The exposition concludes with a strong codetta. The development is primarily built around the head of the main theme, which is thoroughly developed. The recapitulation omits the head of the main <b>theme,</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is recapitulated in C major, thus ending the movement in a major key.|$|R
50|$|The main {{theme of}} Children of the Stones is {{written on the}} {{acoustic}} scale, ambiguously fluctuating between a tonality of C and D major. A signature two-chord harmonic progression, Em9 to G/C, is heard throughout the seven-part series at key dramatic points. A <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is treated in canon and is diegetic music, representing a hymn sung by the spellbound villagers in the story. This theme is later echoed in the guitar and bass when the main child protagonist, Matt, uses his latent psychometric abilities. The <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> also concludes the series in a light jazz arrangement, establishing a lighter tone before the final twist is revealed.|$|R
5000|$|The series' {{theme song}} is The City that isn't there, by singer and {{composer}} Igor Kornelyuk, and lyricist [...] Part I {{of the series}} also features You're a Stranger To Me by Tatiana Bulanova as a <b>secondary</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|R
50|$|The movement, in sonata form, {{frequently}} alternates speed, mood, and key, {{with the}} main key being B minor. It opens quietly with a low bassoon melody. Violins appear with the first theme of the Allegro, a faster variant of the slow opening melody, which eventually leads to the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> in D major. The energetic development section begins abruptly, with an outburst from the orchestra, culminating in a refrain supported by brass and timpani. The movement concludes with the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> in the recapitulation (as the first theme is omitted, because of the tense in the development section) and a coda where both parts are in B major, finally ending very quietly.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> is the self-destructiveness of {{traditional}} Chinese society, likening it to cannibalism. [...] "I have only just realized that I {{have been living}} all these years {{in a place where}} for four thousand years they have been eating human flesh." ...|$|R
5000|$|The third {{movement}} is a fast paced rondo and reintroduces the theme {{heard in the}} first movement, at a more vigorous tempo. The orchestra begins by playing the main theme of the movement in g minor and then the piano repeats the theme in f minor. As the piano continues to play the fast paced notes, the orchestra plays a counter-melody. A glissando from the piano reintroduces the theme from the first movement played in the orchestra before transitioning {{back to the main}} theme. The orchestra then plays a second theme with soft piano accompaniment. Variants of the main and <b>secondary</b> <b>themes</b> return. After a modulation into B-Flat major, the orchestra plays the second blues theme heard in the second movement and the piano responds with the <b>secondary</b> <b>theme.</b> The rat-a-tat rhythm returns, bridging the blues theme and the repeated note melody from the second movement, played by the orchestra. The movement's <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> returns in the piano before playing a chord progression heard in the first movement. A series of fast paced octave scales crescendo into the same [...] "grandioso" [...] heard in the first movement. The rat-a-tat theme returns for the final time in the movement; pentatonic chord progressions and a final F Major 6 tremolo and F major chord finish the piece.|$|R
25|$|The {{protagonist of}} the novel The Orphan Master's Son spends several years during {{the early part of}} the book helping with and {{organizing}} abductions of Japanese to North Korea. These abductions and some of their victims remain an important <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> for the rest of the book.|$|R
50|$|In the {{development}} section, these sets are explored melodically, while the dotted rhythm figure gains even more importance. In the recapitulation, the chord {{progression of the}} first thematic complex is brought to the higher registers, preparing the coda based on <b>secondary</b> <b>theme</b> cantabile element, which gradually broadens.|$|R
