5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>but,</b> as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one before they even existed. This did not guarantee the team a top-level license, it simply qualified them <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> they were later announced as having received a four-year World Tour license. Whether intentionally or incidentally, this corresponded to the initial financial guarantee Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work. This afforded the team automatic invitations to all World Tour events, including the season's three Grand Tours.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the likely {{difficulty}} was simple: the chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, along with their kinsmen of Ngāti Toa, owned the land and had not been paid <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> similar disputes had been previously settled through negotiation, and Te Rauparaha was willing to negotiate on the Wairau land.|$|E
60|$|And Simon de Montfort {{could not}} answer that, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was <b>but</b> the simple truth.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{for those}} who work in it; and I {{think there will be}} {{something}} coming out of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> Sarah,--something, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will be very small. And if so, she must depend <b>for</b> <b>it</b> solely on Mr Rubb." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{distinctive}} opening theme {{used for}} the first fifteen years of the programme was not composed especially <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> is instead the opening eight bars of a 1968 cover of Johnny One Note by Ted Heath and his Music. The closing sting used {{the last couple of}} bars of New Worlds by John Baker, recorded by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.|$|E
25|$|The {{prestige}} {{associated with}} higher education caused a demand <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> many qualified youths were unable to attend colleges and universities because China could not finance enough university places for them. To help meet the demand and to educate a highly trained, specialized work force, China established alternate forms of higher education - such as spare-time, part-time, and radio and television universities.|$|E
25|$|It was {{immediately}} embraced by MCC, who were then lords of all they surveyed, and 1909 {{was the first}} year designated <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> the administrators could not agree {{and by the time}} 1912 was alighted on, world cricket was in conflict. But infighting and a poor performance from the South African team ensured that the idea of a tri-nation tournament remained a one-off occurrence.|$|E
6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{shook her}} head. [...] "No," [...] she said; [...] "he {{reminded}} me of that Florentine filigree thing. It's very pretty, and I bought <b>it</b> <b>for</b> silver, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> isn't." ...|$|R

25|$|After the Italian republican Felice Orsini {{tried to}} assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see Orsini affair). Palmerston {{introduced}} a Conspiracy to Murder Bill {{which made it}} a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives voted <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 {{he was forced to}} resign.|$|E
25|$|I suppose no {{one likes}} to be {{compelled}} to exonerate himself from connections he has never acquired. I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E
25|$|Production {{was stopped}} in September 1944 after 121 bombes had been made. The last-manufactured US Navy bombe {{is on display}} at the US National Cryptologic Museum. Jack Ingram, former Curator of the museum, {{describes}} being told of the existence of a second bombe and searching <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> not finding it whole. Whether it remains in storage in pieces, waiting to be discovered, or no longer exists, is unknown.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me {{directly}} in the face. [...] "I shall call it 'David's air,'" [...] said she; [...] "though if it's the least like what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it's</b> <b>but</b> melancholy music. Your other name I do not like; so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask <b>for</b> <b>it</b> by mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My God--" [...] Lora put {{her hands}} up. Conger cursed. He hadn't meant any of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> her. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> would wear off. There was only a half-amp to it. It would tingle.|$|R

25|$|Eventually, {{approval}} {{was obtained}} from the Church to move forward with the program on a trial basis. The BSA was unwilling to embrace the program and offered no support of any kind <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> they agreed to allow it to be piloted on a limited basis and approved the program design. Materials to support the program, the first Varsity Scout Handbook for the boys and a Leader Guidebook for the adults, were released.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, Tonnie Storey, a 15-year-old {{girl who}} lived in the Over-the-Rhine {{neighborhood}} of Cincinnati disappeared, and eight days later her raped and murdered body was discovered. A bracelet that had been stolen from the Temples in Toledo was found under Storey's body. Coleman and Brown were later convicted of the rape and murder of Storey, and sentenced to death <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> Brown's death sentence was commuted, and later, in a separate proceeding, Coleman's sentence of death was overturned.|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, Aquaman is now {{partners}} with Lagoon Boy, and is crushed upon discovering that Kaldur'am has been corrupted and {{joined forces with}} his father Black Manta. Kaldur'am claims he could not trust Aquaman as he had kept the identity of Black Manta a secret from Kaldur'am. Aquaman states {{that it was a}} mistake, and tries to convince him that no one need suffer <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> Aqualad angrily attacks his teacher. It is later revealed that Aqualad's corruption is truly a facade created so that he may infiltrate the supercriminal organization, the Light.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morrow, gentlemen," [...] {{commenced}} this person, {{as soon as}} {{near enough}} to salute the party {{at the foot of}} the flag-staff; [...] "good-morrow to ye all. I'm glad to meet you, <b>for</b> <b>it's</b> <b>but</b> a Jacob's ladder, this path of yours, through the ravine in the cliffs. Hey! why Atwood," [...] looking around him at the sea of vapour, in surprise, [...] "what the devil has become of the fleet?" ...|$|R

25|$|After the Red Skull's actions cause all {{heroes and}} villains present at his defeat {{to undergo a}} 'moral inversion', Alex {{attempts}} to argue for Janet's life as the X-Men prepare to detonate a gene bomb that will destroy all non-mutants in the blast radius, but accepts the decision nevertheless. After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts to take credit <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E
25|$|Heidi was {{the only}} other Shirley Temple film {{released}} in 1937. Midway through the shooting of the movie, the dream sequence was added into the script. There were reports that the little actress was behind the dream sequence and she had enthusiastically pushed <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> in her autobiography, she vehemently denied it. Her contract gave neither her nor her parents any creative control over the movies she was in. She saw this as the collapse of any serious attempt by the studio to build upon the dramatic role from the previous movie Wee Willie Winkie.|$|E
25|$|After council {{approval}} for Williams site, {{the city and}} Kingdon Gould III became locked in negotiations over Gould's land which would take nearly two years to resolve. The reason for the negotiations is not clear. Gould joined the original proposal by Marriott to build the hotel, and seemed willing to use his land <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> at some point between October 2002 and January 2006, {{it became clear that}} private financing for the convention headquarters hotel could not be obtained with so many property owners. Gould was the smallest property holder and was not providing equity for the project, which led to negotiations to obtain his land.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} issue for the left in the early 1980s was {{to change the system}} of election of the Leader of the Labour Party, which had until then been chosen solely by Labour MPs. The left wanted to have the Leader elected by an 'electoral college' which would include affiliated trade unions and individual Constituency Labour Parties. At the 1980 Labour Party conference a procedural motion to allow the change to be made without delay was narrowly carried after Heffer argued <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> all proposals for balancing the composition of the electoral college were defeated and the issue was deferred until a special conference.|$|E
25|$|The Cannes Film Festival has {{its origins}} in 1932 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the {{proposal}} of historian Philippe Erlanger and {{with the support of}} the British and Americans, set up an international cinematographic festival. Its origins may be attributed in part to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time was shocking the democratic world by its fascist bias. The first festival was planned for 1939, Cannes was selected as the location <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> the funding and organization were too slow and finally the beginning of World War II put an end to this plan.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 1962, Geiger crashed {{directly}} into the center field wall at Fenway Park attempting to catch a Tito Francona drive as the Red Sox lost to his old team Cleveland in 13 innings. He ventured back on the dirt track and {{looked as if he}} were {{going to come up with}} the ball. He made a sudden leap <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> struck the wall, and the ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly to his knees and fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.|$|E
