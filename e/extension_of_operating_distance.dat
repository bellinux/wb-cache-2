40|$|This paper disaggregates {{aircraft}} {{operating costs}} into various cost categories and provides background for an engineering approach used to compute a generalized aircraft trip cost function. Engineering cost values for specific airplane designs were generated {{for a broad}} spread <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>distances,</b> enabling a direct analysis <b>of</b> the <b>operating</b> cost function and avoiding {{the problems associated with}} financial reporting practices. The resulting data points were used to calibrate a cost function for aircraft trip expenses as they vary in seating capacity and distance. This formula and the parameter values are then compared to econometric results, based on historical data. Results are intended to be used to adjust reported costs so that conclusions about industry structure based on cost regressions correctly account for differences in stage lengths and capacities. A Cobb-Douglas cost function is also computed, providing elasticity parameters for both economies of density, through seat capacity, and distance as they would be determined from clean airline-neutral data. The results are particularly useful for route network design because they establish a simple planar connection between frequency, capacity and costs. Although the econometric cost functions are no less accurate, it is generally much less convenient for subsequent analysis. Operating cost functions Aircraft Air transport Econometrics...|$|R

This paper presents the design and simulation of a conventional parallel-coupled line band pass microstrip filter for C-Band communication. The band pass filter operates at a centre frequency of 6. 93 GHz suitable for C-Band communication. A miniature 4 th order filter is considered to obtain better selectivity and stop band rejection with a bandwidth of 693 MHz and a fractional bandwidth of 10 %. The filter is simulated using commercial software Serenade v 8. 5 (make: Ansoft Corp.) at a resonant frequency of 6. 93 GHz and 0. 5 dB equal-ripple response. The filter is fabricated using photolithography process and the simulated response is verified with network analyzer (make: Agilent) and a good agreement is found.

The aim of this work was to determine the metrological characteristics of capture gamma-ray fields from titanium target and nickel target obtained at the AT 140 Neutron Calibration Facility to provide dosimetry up to 10 MeV. We have chosen energy intervals in which we can calibrate dosimetry devices taking into account the accompanying generation of gamma-ray neutrons by the fast neutron source 238 PuBe, the capture radiation of collimator materials and capture radiation from targets. We measured air kerma rate with the aid of the reference AT 5350 dosimeter with the ionization chamber TM 32002. Using the Monte-Carlo simulation, we obtained the energy distribution of the air kerma rate for targets. We determined the geometric dimensions of the uniform field and the interval <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> the facility.

40|$|Over the years, health {{monitoring}} of moving parts in machines {{has become a}} critical process in several applications. Health monitoring aims to measure system parameters like temperature and strain using sensors {{in order to take}} corrective action before the failure of the machine. Temperature is one of the critical parameters that have to be measured for {{health monitoring}} in applications that employ sliding surface motion. Existing temperature sensors are wired sensors. They are difficult to integrate in sliding surfaces and hence wireless sensing needs to be employed. Sensing telemeters proposed and implemented previously are powered by either batteries or inductive coupling. Battery-powered systems are constrained by their limited lifetime, while systems powered by inductive-coupling are constrained by their limited <b>operating</b> <b>distance.</b> This research discusses an approach to solve the problems posed by both battery powered systems and systems powered by inductive-coupling. In addition, this research also outlines the design of wireless temperature sensing methodology for highly polished sliding surfaces. This research focuses on the application of Rectifying Antennae (Rectenna) to remotely power telemeters over a few meters <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>distance.</b> Two 2. 4 GHz rectenna designs have been proposed and implemented to remotely harvest a min- imum of 8 mW of power from a 10 W transmitter over a distance of 3 meters. In addition, EM-circuit co-simulation based design procedures for rectenna have also been presented in this research. Using a novel wireless sensing method based on electromagnetic induction, temperature sensing of two highly polished sliding surfaces has been accomplished. This design, capable of temperature measurements up to 80 C, was implemented using commercially available inductors and temperature sensing capacitors. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While {{the demand}} on {{electric}} power is consistently increasing, public concerns and regulations {{for the construction of}} new nuclear power plants are getting restrict, and also operating nuclear power plants are gradually ageing. For this reason, the interest on lifetime extension for operating nuclear power plants by applying lifetime management system is increasing. The 40 -year design life concept was originally introduced on the basis of economic and safety considerations. In other words, it was not determined by technological evaluations. Also, the transient design data which were applied for fatigue damage evaluation were overly conservative in comparison with actual transient data. Therefore, the accumulation of fatigue damage may result in a big difference between the actual data and the design data. The lifetime of nuclear power plants is mostly dependent on the fatigue life of a reactor pressure vessel, and thus, the exact evaluation of fatigue life on a reactor pressure vessel is a crucial factor in determining the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> life. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce a real-time fatigue monitoring system for an operating reactor pressure vessel which can be used for the lifetime extension. In order to satisfy the objectives, a web-based transient acquisition system was developed, thereby, real-time thermal-hydraulic data were reserved for 18 operating reactor pressure vessels. A series of finite element analyses was carried out to obtai...|$|R
