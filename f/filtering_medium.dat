50|$|The main {{difference}} between turboswing and most common filters {{is that in}} turboswing filters the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> is not static. There is a perforated disk rotating at high speed. When the grease particles go through the rotating disk they are separated from the air.|$|E
50|$|These filters use sand as the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium.</b> Sand filters {{look like}} large balls and they hold hundred {{of pounds of}} sterile sand. Water flows {{into the top of}} the filter housing and makes its way down through the sand bed where the sharp edges of the sand catch the particulates. On a micron-to-micron comparison, sand filters remove the least amount of dirt - {{particles}} as small as 20 to 25 microns.

50|$|The use of {{nanofiber}} webs as a <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> is well established. Due to {{the small}} size of the fibers London-Van Der Waals forces are an important method of adhesion between the fibers and the captured materials. Polymeric nanofibers have been used in air filtration applications for more than seven decades. Because of poor bulk mechanical properties of thin nanowebs, they are laid over a filtration medium substrate. The small fiber diameters cause slip flows at fiber surfaces, causing an increase in the interception and inertial impaction efficiencies of these composite filter media. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same pressure drop is possible with fibers having diameters less than 0.5 micrometer. Since the essential properties of protective clothing are high moisture vapor transport, increased fabric breath-ability, and enhanced toxic chemical resistance, electrospun nanofiber membranes are good candidates for these applications.|$|E

It is shown that the appearance of the different fractional consistence of small dispersive coal dust particles with the decreasing dimensions down to the micro and nano sizes at the action of the air dust aerosol stream normally results in a significant change of distribution of the small dispersive coal dust particles masses in the granular <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> of an absorber in the vertical iodine air filter, changing the vertical iodine air filter aerodynamic characteristics.

40|$|The {{dewatering}} of {{iron ore}} concentrates requires large capacity {{in addition to}} producing a cake with low moisture content. Such large processes are commonly energy intensive and means to lower the specific energy consumption are needed. Ceramic capillary action disc filters incorporate a novel <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> enabling the harnessing of capillary action, which results in decreased energy consumption in comparison to traditional filtration technologies. As another benefit, the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> is mechanically and chemically more durable than, for example, filter cloths and can, thus, withstand harsh operating conditions and possible regeneration better than other types of filter media. In iron ore dewatering, the regeneration of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> is done {{through a combination of}} several techniques: (1) backwashing, (2) ultrasonic cleaning, and (3) acid regeneration. Although it is commonly acknowledged that the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> is affected by slurry particles and extraneous compounds, published research, especially in the field of dewatering of mineral concentrates, is scarce. Whereas the regenerative effect of backwashing and ultrasound are more or less mechanical, regeneration with acids is based on chemistry. The chemistry behind the acid regeneration is, naturally, dissolution. The dissolution of iron oxide particles has been extensively studied over several decades but those studies may not necessarily be directly applicable in the regeneration of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> which has undergone interactions with the slurry components. The aim of this thesis was to investigate if free particle dissolution indeed correlates with the regeneration of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium.</b> For this purpose, both free particle dissolution and dissolution of surface adhered particles were studied. The focus was on acidic dissolution of iron oxide particles and on the study of the ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> used in the dewatering of iron ore concentrates. The free particle dissolution experiments show that the solubility of synthetic fine grained iron oxide particles in oxalic acid could be explained through linear models accounting for the effects of temperature and acid concentration, whereas the dissolution of a natural magnetite is not so easily explained by such models. In addition, the kinetic experiments performed both support and contradict the work of previous authors: the suitable kinetic model here supports previous research suggesting solid state reduction to be the reaction mechanism of hematite dissolution but the formation of a stable iron oxalate is not supported by the results of this research. Several other dissolution mechanisms have also been suggested for iron oxide dissolution in oxalic acid, indicating that the details of oxalate promoted reductive dissolution are not yet agreed and, in this respect, this research offers added value to the community. The results of the regeneration experiments with the ceramic filter media show that oxalic acid is highly effective in removing iron oxide particles {{from the surface of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>medium.</b> The dissolution of those particles did not, however, exhibit the expected behaviour, i. e. complete dissolution. The results of this thesis show that although the regeneration of the ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> with acids incorporates the dissolution of slurry particles from the surface of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium,</b> the regeneration cannot be assessed purely based upon free particle dissolution. A steady state, dependent on temperature and on the acid concentration, was observed in the dissolution of particles from the surface even though the limit of solubility of free iron oxide particles had not been reached. Both the regeneration capacity and efficiency, with regards to the removal of iron oxide particles, was found to be temperature dependent, but was not affected by the acid concentration. This observation further suggests that the removal of the surface adhered particles does not follow the dissolution of free particles, which do exhibit a dependency on the acid concentration. In addition, changes in the permeability and in the pore structure of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> were still observed after the bulk concentration of dissolved iron had reached a steady state. Consequently, the regeneration of the <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> continued after the dissolution of particles from the surface had ceased. This observation suggests that internal changes take place at the final stages of regeneration. The regeneration process could, in theory, be divided into two, possibly overlapping, stages: (1) dissolution of surface-adhered particles, and (2) dissolution of extraneous compounds from within the pore structure. In addition to the fundamental knowledge generated during this thesis, tools to assess the effects of parameters on the regeneration of the ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> are needed. It has become clear that the same tools used to estimate the dissolution of free particles cannot be used to estimate the regeneration of a <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> unless only a robust characterisation of the order of regeneration efficiency is needed...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} {{of the small}} dispersive coal dust particles with the nano and micro sizes in the granular <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> with the cylindrical coal granules in the absorber in the horizontal iodine air filter during its long term operation at the nuclear power plant are researched. It is shown that the concentration density maxima of the small dispersive coal dust particles appear in the granular <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> with the cylindrical coal absorbent granules in the horizontal iodine air filter at an action by the air dust aerosol blow. The comparison of the measured aerodynamic resistances of the horizontal and vertical iodine air filters is conducted. The main conclusion is that {{the magnitude of the}} aerodynamic resistance of the horizontal iodine air filters is much smaller in comparison with the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance of the vertical iodine air filters at the same loads of the air dust aerosol volumes. It is explained that the direction of the air dust aerosol blow and the direction of the gravitation force in the horizontal iodine air filter are orthogonal, hence the effective accumulation of the small dispersive coal dust particles takes place at the bottom of absorber in the horizontal iodine air filter. It is found that the air dust aerosol stream flow in the horizontal iodine air filter is not limited by the appearing structures, made of the precipitated small dispersive coal dust particles, in distinction from the vertical iodine air filter, in the process of long term operation of the iodine air filters at the nuclear power plant.

By utilizing adequate mathematical models and efficient numerical methods, such software tools are able to produce reliable predictions of fluid flow, pressure distribution and filtration efficiency. In the case of non-deformable porous media, problem-adapted simulation software has proven its worth in industrial applications for years. On the other hand, {{there are more and}} more practically relevant cases in which the assumption of a rigid filter medium leads to simulation results that differ a lot from experimental observation. The interaction between the fluid and the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> can have a substantial impact on the performance of the filter element - in some cases even for rather small deformations. In view of these facts one can state that there is an increasing demand for the integration of poroelastic effects into the simulation of the performance of filter element designs. Computer simulation of this Fluid-Porous-Structure Interaction (FPSI) requires the numerical solution of a coupled problem. In particular, one has to identify a proper poroelasticity model for filtering media. As a starting point, the classical Biot model was considered, which is three-dimensional in space. For suitable geometries of the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium,</b> one can derive a two-dimensional model describing a so-called poroelastic plate which allows for faster solution of the elasticity problem. Numerical tests show a good agreement of the results obtained for the plate models with both the full 3 D model and analytical solutions that are known for simple geometries. The method was also applied to real-world scenarios, where very promising results could be obtained...|$|E
