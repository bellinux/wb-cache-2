500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fool Circle {{is notable}} for a reggae sound {{on many of}} the songs. In an {{interview}} bassist Pete Agnew commented:"'Fool Circle' was the nearest we came to making a concept album, trying to inject a bit of humour into a pretty heavy subject. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we recorded it on the island of Montserrat might account for a teeny bit of reggae poking its way through." ...|$|E

5000|$|Speaking to The Blog That Celebrates Itself in 2009 {{about the}} EP, singer Steve Waterhouse said: [...] "We were only just finding our feet as a {{recording}} band {{during that time}} - something we've become a lot better at, which I think will show on the next record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it was recorded live comes through and that’s something we’re all really pleased about. There's a looseness that you can only get from playing live." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, Bono {{said of the}} song, [...] "It {{would be}} stupid to start drawing up battle lines, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 'New Year's Day' made the Top Ten {{indicated}} a disillusionment among record buyers. I don't think 'New Year's Day' was a pop single, certainly {{not in the way}} that Mickie Most might define a pop single as something that lasts three minutes and three weeks in the chart. I don't think we could have written that kind of song." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Wu debuted on the {{big screen}} with a three part-film series, The Four, {{starring}} Ronald Cheng, Anthony Wong, Deng Chao, and Liu Yifei. In February 2013, she was cast in the Korean reality show, We Got Married with Ok Taecyeon, of South Korean boy band 2PM, as her virtual husband. Regarding this experience, she has commented, [...] "I feel thankful that you found me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I was able to do this show was a gift from the up above." ...|$|E

After all these years – I'm 41 now, and really, I shouldn't be in a pop group any more, but I am and it's still my job! I {{wake up in the}} morning and I haven't got to go to a nine-to-five.

He had a mother, but no father. I had a father, but no mother. Strange coincidence! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> helped to draw us together. I may be wrong, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. Jack was on a visit to us at the time, so I had only to cross the passage to reach his room.|$|R

I just didn't feel good about the whole thing, I felt {{swallowed}} up by the whole deal. It was just a situation where you couldn't go to work. But I think now I'd probably get through that show.|$|E
50|$|He was an iron man. But {{somewhere along}} the line I think he lacked something, the {{dedication}} to make bike-racing a full-time career. Maybe he didn't want to, but he certainly had most of the qualities. He had the strength, he could climb and of course he could time-trial. What he really needed was {{to be part of a}} good continental racing team. Then I think he would have gone to the very top. But whether or not his personality would have got in the way, that's another thing. You need a bit of modesty and humility to achieve that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Ray dropped right out of the sport proves that his interest didn't go deep enough. Why he went off and hid away, I don't know.|$|E

Asked how Sally feels about Tim, Dynevor said: [...] "I think she really loves Tim and she really cares for him but she's hoping she's {{going to be able to}} change him into the man she's always wanted to be with." [...] Asked how Sally reacts to the proposal Dunevor said: [...] "It does come out of the blue to Sally. They have spoken about getting married in the past then decided they were happy just to be living together, so it does come as a shock. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he gets down on one knee, he's got the music, he's bought the ring and he does it in front of everybody does mean Sally's thrilled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'The sister,' said Bradley, {{separating}} {{his words}} over-carefully, and speaking {{as if he}} were repeating them from a book, 'suffers under no reproach that repels a man of unimpeachable character who had made for himself every step of his way in life, from placing her in his own station. I will not say, raising her to his own station; I say, placing her in it. The sister labours under no reproach, unless she should unfortunately make it for herself. When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal, and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> must be taken to be pretty expressive.' ...|$|R

5000|$|In January 2013 McAllister {{completed}} a move League One rivals and former loan club Shrewsbury Town {{for an undisclosed}} fee, signing a two and a half-year deal. Manager Graham Turner said [...] "It's just over a week ago that Sheffield United accepted a bid for David, so obviously we're pleased to have concluded the deal... Initially {{it was a surprise}} that they would sell him as he's figured in a lot of their games, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he has been here and knows all about us, knows the professional attitude and the work ethic here helped in his decision to join us." [...] McAllister scored his first goal in Shrewsbury colours on 2 March 2013 in a 3-1 defeat to Walsall at the Bescot Stadium. McAllister picked up an ankle injury in March 2014, which saw him miss the season run-in as Shrewsbury were relegated to League Two.|$|E
5000|$|Former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice {{had also}} auditioned for Gillan but {{according}} to guitarist Bernie Torme [...] "...he had some difficulty after playing [...] "Secret of the Dance" [...] due to his only having one lung, and being {{a bit out of}} practice. He played it brilliantly but he had to lie down on the floor for five minutes afterwards. He did not want to join because of our fast tracks, he said he no longer wanted to play stuff like that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he had been offered to join Whitesnake with his old friend Jon Lord made a big difference. Meeting Gillan again at the studio had obviously put Underwood's name on the list of potentials for the job, and as Torme revealed [...] "...we finally found the magnificently solid and under appreciated Mick Underwood. The day after he accepted the job, Underwood and the band began to record the Mr. Universe album, released in October 1979.|$|E
5000|$|... "The TV show did {{not help}} my {{reputation}} very much. It was difficult to be taken seriously, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I went to school to study fashion {{and worked in the}} industry helped me. I think it's a good thing to feel like you have to prove something, because you're always {{going to have to work}} a little bit harder." [...] - Conrad discussing her efforts in attaining credibility within the fashion industry. Since appearing on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, Conrad has been recognized as being among the first individuals to benefit from the popularity of reality television in the early 2000s. In 2009, Thomas Rogers from Salon described her as [...] "one of the dullest major characters in reality television history", but opined that her normalcy compared to her co-stars on The Hills made her [...] "vaguely likable". An editor from People stated that Conrad [...] "became a full-blown TV phenom" [...] during its third season, which notably introduced the conflict with Montag and Pratt, in addition to controversy regarding scripting allegations.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Frank and Louie as the world's oldest living janus cat.

This signified that the beta period began once the sign-in button reappeared on the website. On 15 August 2011, the sign-in button reappeared, welcome emails were sent out, and the beta period began. A very small number of users were invited to begin their use of Pottermore on the first day. More users were invited until 27 September, that marked when the final invitation emails were sent. Early users also said that even though the site did not bring back the same feelings of excitement from when the books were released, it did add an extra layer to the reading experience.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the weekend}} of August 18, 2007, Ravenstahl used a Homeland Security funded SUV {{to go to a}} Toby Keith concert at the Post-Gazette Pavilion.

Responding to the allegations of impropriety, Ravenstahl said [...] "I'm still {{going to continue to be}} who I'm going to be, and go to concerts like I always have, and go to have a drink with my wife in bars. That's what 27-year-olds do and I shouldn't be any different ...

5000|$|Elvis next {{appeared}} {{on national television}} singing [...] "Hound Dog" [...] on The Steve Allen Show on July 1. Steve Allen wrote: [...] "When I booked Elvis, I naturally {{had no interest in}} just presenting him vaudeville-style and letting him do his spot as he might in concert. Instead we worked him into the comedy fabric of our program…We certainly didn't inhibit Elvis' then-notorious pelvic gyrations, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he had on formal evening attire made him, purely on his own, slightly alter his presentation." [...] As Allen was notoriously contemptuous of rock 'n' roll music and songs such as [...] "Hound Dog", he smirkingly presented Elvis [...] "with a roll that looks exactly like a large roll of toilet paper with, says Allen, the 'signatures of eight thousand fans,'" [...] and the singer had to wear a tuxedo while singing an abbreviated version of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] to an actual top hat-wearing Basset Hound. Although by most accounts Presley was a good sport about it, according to Scotty Moore, the next morning they were all angry about their treatment the previous night.|$|E

40|$|Leadership! Books {{have been}} written about it, yet we still seem to want more {{accounts}} of it.

5000|$|Walsh said of {{the film}} that he went through over 300 hours of footage, {{watching}} everything that was sent to him. [...] "I felt very much a responsibility to do so. Enormous effort went into those submissions from thousands of people. I was worried {{that we were going}} to get 4,000 hours, that would have been a real problem. Three hundred hours was manageable. Every day we saw something new. Every day was exciting.” Walsh said. Walsh spent six months editing the film and while there’s certainly a lot of love for Bruce in the documentary, there were some things that he steered away from. [...] "There were stories about how generous he is, stuff about 9/11, and he comes off a bit god-like, and I didn’t feel comfortable with those stories. I think this film doesn’t build Bruce to be a god. There’s an undercurrent that he’s a very decent man, and that does come across in the stories that are told. It’s just very heartfelt stories of people talking about how Bruce and his music has affected their lives. One guy from Israel says, ‘Bruce taught me how to be a man — a decent man.’ That’s who Bruce is. I really tried not to make it heavy-handed. I didn’t come to the film as a Bruce Springsteen fan. I’m leaving it as a great admirer. I think his career is astonishing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he’s still producing relevant music — the fact that 2012 he released Wrecking Ball at the age of 60, that’s an amazing achievement." [...] Walsh said that Springsteen saw the film and really enjoyed the humor in it. The people in the film were really eloquent. His management informed Walsh that Springsteen really enjoyed the film.|$|E
