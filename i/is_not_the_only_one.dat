5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{that uses}} the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem {{were used for the}} catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E

25|$|The Springfield Terminal is {{the main}} rail of the city. It mostly stays next to US Route 202. Although, that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> The St. Lawrence and Atlantic rail also flows through the city. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic rail also goes by the Auburn-Lewiston Airport and splits into north, east, and south directions.|$|E
25|$|In general, the alienable–inalienable {{distinction}} {{is an example}} of a binary possessive class system, i.e., a language in which two kinds of possession are distinguished (alienable and inalienable). The alienability {{distinction is}} the most common kind of binary possessive class system, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> Some languages have more than two possessive classes: the Anêm language of Papua New Guinea, for example, has at least 20 and Amele language has 32.|$|E
25|$|The Septuagint {{seems to}} have been a major source for the Apostles, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> St. Jerome offered, for example, Matt 2:15 and 2:23, John 19:37, John 7:38, 1 Cor. 2:9. as {{examples}} not found in the Septuagint, but in Hebrew texts. (Matt 2:23 is not present in current Masoretic tradition either, though according to St. Jerome it was in Isaiah 11:1.) The New Testament writers, when citing the Jewish scriptures, or when quoting Jesus doing so, freely used the Greek translation, implying that Jesus, his Apostles and their followers considered it reliable.|$|E

25|$|And the Earth <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{that changed}} - the {{luminosity}} {{of the sun}} has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth’s beginnings, {{there must have been}} more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet’s history. Moreover, more subtle changes in the habitat of life are always occurring, shaping the organisms and traces that we observe today and in the rock record.|$|E
25|$|Disruptions of PPI are {{studied in}} humans {{and many other}} species. The most studied are deficits of PPI in schizophrenia, {{although}} this disease <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{to be associated with}} such deficits. They have been noted in panic disorder (Ludewig, et al., 2005), schizotypal personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder(Swerdlow et al., 1993), Huntington's disease, nocturnal enuresis and attention deficit disorder (Ornitz et al. 1992), and Tourette's syndrome (Swerdlow et al. 1994; Castellanos et al. 1996). According to one study, people who have temporal lobe epilepsy with psychosis also show decreases in PPI, unlike those who have TLE without psychosis. Therefore, PPI deficits are not typical to specific disease, but rather tell of disruptions in a specific brain circuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the apostolic use of the Old Testament, for example, the Septuagint and the now lost Hebrew texts (though to some degree and in some form carried on in Masoretic tradition) is complicated. The Septuagint {{seems to have been}} a major source for the Apostles, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> St. Jerome offered, for example, Matt 2:15 and 2:23, John 19:37, John 7:38, 1 Cor. 2:9. as examples not found in the Septuagint, but in Hebrew texts. (Matt 2:23 is not present in current Masoretic tradition either, though according to St. Jerome it was in Hosea 11:1.)

25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in {{the high end of the}} market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.|$|E

Jack Sobel, The Ocean Conservancy's director of strategic conservation said in a 2002 interview that [...] "I don't know of any cases where there's been a success with tire reefs." [...] That year, The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup removed 11,956 tires from beaches all over the world.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found it interesting that the ancient Oedipus complex continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, but he added that [...] "Connor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E

500|$|Wisemore <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{to serve}} as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This {{is not to suggest that}} Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E
500|$|The trips {{between the}} cities are {{seen by the}} public as [...] "a money-wasting junket hugely enjoyed by journalists, MEPs and researchers" [...] when {{in fact it is}} [...] "a money-wasting junket loathed by journalists, MEPs and researchers" [...] {{according}} to Gary Titley, MEP (PES), who announced he would not be standing for re-election in 2009 because of the two-seat issue. Titley stated that he could [...] "no longer tolerate the shifting of the Parliament lock, stock and barrel to Strasbourg one week a month...It's a miserable journey and it's always a problem" [...] noting the problems in lost luggage. As well as undermining the EU's climate change objectives, he criticises the Strasbourg sessions as the deals have already been made leading to them becoming formal voting sessions padded out with [...] "debates saying we are against sin." [...] Titley also states that, because the journeys take so much time, the committees in Brussels who do the bulk of the work do not have sufficient time to work. Titley <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to leave over the issue; Eluned Morgan MEP is standing down in 2009 for similar reasons, notably due to the toll the moving has on time with her family, and former MEP Simon Murphy quit as leader of the Socialists in 2002 due to the inconvenience of the arrangement.|$|E
500|$|More {{recently}} {{it has been}} proposed that the true author was Henry Lovelich, a poet, whom Gregory would have known well, since they are both mentioned in the will of a prominent London merchant in July 1434. J.A.F. Thomson has suggested that, actually, the chronicler was a churchman, due among other things to the quantity of Latin aphorisms the later text contains, compared with the pre-1467 section; either way, Thomson agrees that whoever it was, {{must have been a}} man with [...] "London connections and a pride in the city." [...] One of the most recent biographers Gregory has noted how, in fact, [...] "a single reference, to a papal indulgence issued in 1455, associates Gregory personally with [...] chronicle... but the extent of his authorship is uncertain." [...] For instance Michael Hicks goes no further than to suggest tentatively that, of all the London chroniclers, “at least one was a mayor,” whilst Jeremy Catto believes that [...] "that we can identify no particular individual writer.“ Mary-Rose McLaren summed up the problem facing historians wishing to establish the authorship of the Edgerton MS when she pointed out that, comparing Gregory's chronicle with others of the period, {{there is more than one}} mayor named in it, and that in any case, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to name Gregory as the mayor of London during that time.|$|E
