This {{process can}} effectively {{lead to the}} depletion of vital protective reserves of the sulfur amino acid cysteine and thereby making Vicia sativa seed a dangerous component in mixture with other toxin sources. The Spanish pulse mix [...] contains common vetch and bitter vetch in addition to vetchling (Lathyrus cicera) seeds; it can be fed in small quantities to ruminants, but its use as a staple food will cause lathyrism even in these animals. Moreover, common vetch as well as broad bean - and probably other species of Vicia too - contain oxidants like convicine, isouramil, divicine and vicine in quantities sufficient to lower glutathione levels in G6PD-deficient persons to cause favism disease. At least broad beans also contain the lectin phytohemagglutinin and are somewhat poisonous if eaten raw. Split common vetch seeds resemble split red lentils (Lens culinaris), and has been occasionally mislabelled as such by exporters or importers to be sold for human consumption. In some countries where lentils are highly popular - e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt, India and Pakistan - import bans on suspect produce have been established to prevent these potentially harmful scams.|$|E

The influence of some exptl. parameters on the pollutant degrdn. was tested. The {{study of the}} effect of the residence time shows that when this parameter decreases the removal efficiency decreases also. When the residence time is reduced five times the removal efficiency is reduced from 83 to 59 %. The influence of relative humidity shows that when this parameter increases the selectivities of CO 2 are more important. The byproducts identified and analyzed are classified into three groups: <b>intermediary</b> <b>products,</b> carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ozone. Concerning the org. components, we note that when the input plasma energy increases this lead to a higher mineralization of the pollutant i. e. that <b>intermediary</b> <b>products</b> formed decrease and carbon dioxide increases. The mass-balance on carbon products is achieved at about 100 %. The ozone formation is favored by increasing input energy.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} of methyltins, {{as environmental}} pollutants, has scarcely been studied so far {{because of the}} shortage of rapid and sensitive speciation methods, {{even though they have}} very simple structures. The photodegradation of monomethyltin trichloride (MMT), dimethyltin dichloride (DMT) and trimethyltin chloride (TMT) was studied with our new developed HPLC-FPD hyphenated system, which enables rapid and sensitive detection of methyltins. The half-life times and kinetic rate constants of their degradation at different pH were calculated. The results suggest that MMT, DMT and TMT can be degraded under the UV irradiation rapidly at different pH, with a degradation rate sequence of TMT < DMT < MMT. Ail unknown <b>intermediary</b> <b>product,</b> which is more stable and has higher concentration at pH 8 for MMT and DMT, of methyltin photodegradation was detected for the first time. This unknown <b>intermediary</b> <b>product</b> was identified as methyloltin with electrospray mass spectrometry, and the possible mechanism was proposed based on the <b>intermediary</b> <b>product.</b> The effects of some environmental parameters such as salinity and humic acid on the degradation rate of methyltins were also investigated. Results suggest that salinity and humic acid have strong effect on their degradation, especially for TMT, which was almost never degraded in the solutions containing NaCl and humic acid.
