5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other.

Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> distantly so.|$|E

5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Resolution was {{provided}} by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are needed to understand the complete relationship between these four genera.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality.

Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
30|$|In daily {{clinical}} practise, {{an inadequate}} response <b>to</b> MTX may <b>be</b> followed by switching to an alternative DMARD (Royal College of Physicians 2009), and {{in line with}} this we found the use of either corticosteroids or concurrent DMARDs to deter MTX restart.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is usually}} {{observed}} that medical students undergo tremendous stress during {{various stages of}} the MBBS course. There is {{a high rate of}} suicide among them. METHODS: To determine incidence of stress and factors controlling stress in medical students at various stages of MBBS course at Seth G S Medical college, 238 students (First year 98, Second 76, Third 64) <b>were</b> asked <b>to</b> complete a questionnaire on personal data (gender, stay at hostel, mode of travel, time spent in travel every day, medium of study in school, place of school education.), Stress inducing factors, Zung&#x 2032;s depression scale, ways of coping, stress relievers, perceived social support and personality type. Statistical tests used were ANOVA, critical ratio and Student&#x 2032;s &#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test. RESULTS: Majority of medical students (175 / 238 [...] 73 &#x 0025;) perceived stress. Stress <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in Second and Third MBBS students rather than First MBBS levels (p < 0. 05). Stress <b>was</b> not <b>found</b> <b>to</b> differ significantly on the basis of sex, stay at hostel, model of travel, time spent in travel every day, medium of study in school, place of school education. Stress <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in students having more than 95 &#x 0025; of marks at 12 th Standard as compared to others. Academic factors were greater perceived cause of stress in medical students. There {{was no significant difference in}} the students at different levels of MBBS regarding academic factors and social factors as a stress inducing factors. Physical factors <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in Second and Third MBBS students as compared to First MBBS students. Emotional factors <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in First MBBS students as compared to Second &#x 0026; Third MBBS students. Stress <b>was</b> <b>more</b> common in medical students who have dominant strategy of coping as positive reappraisal, accepting responsibility and planful problem solving. Stress was less common in medical students at Seth G S Medical College who have dominant strategy of coping as escaping and distancing from difficult situation. Family and Friend as perceived social supports <b>were</b> <b>more</b> in Second MBBS than First MBBS medical students. Stress <b>was</b> not <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in students having their personality factor contributing to stress (Type A [...] 52 / 67) as compared to others (Type B [...] 123 / 171). This indicates that the stress was not trait oriented but was process oriented (p = NS). CONCLUSION: Stress in medical students is common and is process oriented. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> in second and third year. Academic factors are greater perceived cause of stress in medical students at Seth G S medical college. Emotional factors <b>are</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>more</b> in First MBBS. It is dependent on person&#x 2032;s ways of coping and social support...|$|R

5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens.
