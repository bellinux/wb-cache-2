5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, <b>edge</b> <b>joint,</b> and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

The metal inert gas pulse brazing process parameters used in this study included wire feed speeds, arc voltages, travel speed, peak currents, and pulse frequency.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is {{performed on the}} implementation of bending-torsion coupling of a composite wind turbine rotor blade to provide passive pitch-control. Limited passive torsion deformation is realised with a structural coupling between flapwise bending and elastic twist of a constant speed rotor-blade. The blade and skin laminate configuration are analysed with a FEM program, in which a complete blade with spar webs is modelled. This conventional blade configuration has some disadvantages. Therefore alternative design concepts are reviewed, where the coupling plies are restricted to a load-bearing spar, while a softer skin provides for the aerodynamic shape. From additional analysis, it is found that, while for the two alternative design concepts the stress concentrations at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>joint</b> are bypassed, the bending-torsion coupling response is lower. An experiment was performed to validate the calculation methods. The experimental results show good correlation with theoretical predictions. It is recommended to investigate further the fatigue life properties of a glass/carbon hybrid FRP with off-axis fibre orientations. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, strength and deformational behavior of slopping anisotropic rock mass have been assessed experimentally as well as analytically. The jointed rock mass assembled using sand stone element of 25 mm × 25 mm × 75 mm along different joint angles of 15 ˚, 30 ˚, 45 ˚, 60 ˚, 75 ˚ and 90 ˚ and slope angles of 30 ˚, 45 ˚, 60 ˚, 75 ˚, and 90 ˚ with the horizontal in plane strain condition and 15 cm × 15 cm footing placed exactly {{at the edge of the}} slope as well as at 15 cm from <b>edge.</b> <b>Joint</b> angle, distance of footing from edge and modes of failure are important parameters, which govern the load intensity at slope apart from rock mass properties.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the study of}} a gapless and rudderless aeroelastic fin (GRAF) to enhance the directional stability and controllability of an aircraft. The GRAF concept was proposed and developed {{in the wake of}} previous research, targeted to improve flight performance and manoeuvrability, and to reduce fuel consumption and airframe weight. The study involved the subjects of aerodynamics, structural design and analysis, and flight mechanics. The work includes conceptual design, structural modelling, aeroelastic analysis and flight performance evaluation of a GRAF variant designed for a small subsonic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The Eclipse UAV, a platform designed by part time students at the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Cranfield University, was chosen as a case study. A new approach to design a more effective fin with an unconventional structural layout and novel techniques which have not been investigated in previous research is proposed. Despite the GRAF planform being similar to classical fin-hinged rudder configurations, it is provided with a flexible gapless control surface, kept as one continuous piece and integrated with the fin primary structure. With its fixed root and rudderless feature, the GRAF adopts an original method of operation. Its way of working relies upon an unconventional technique of combining morphing technology and aeroelastic effect. The morphable configuration is twisted to gain an aeroelastically beneficial effect to enhance the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the aircraft. This warping capability of the fin is the key role player enabling the GRAF surface to seamlessly generate the required aerodynamic forces. Unlike the conventional structures designed to be as rigid as possible to withstand the external loads, the GRAF will exploit its structure‟s flexibility to use the aeroelastically induced twist deformations for a self-adaptive warping behaviour and improve flight dynamic response and performance. In order to ensure the above features are achievable in practice, further study on the structural configuration was conducted. To achieve performance improvement, together with the original structural layout and aeroelastic effect exploitation, another three novel key components are investigated, proposed and introduced in the GRAF model. A structurally integrated actuation system, termed L-shape stringers device (LSS), is designed to transform actuator axial forces in spanwise distributed bending moments, to create seamless deformations of the trailing edge (TE) section. An innovative trailing <b>edge</b> <b>joint,</b> namely the swivel edge closure, is specifically designed to enhance the mobility and degrees of freedom of the trailing edge box. It is a revolutionary concept which, by virtually interrupting the structural integrity of the closed TE section, allows relative translation and rotation of the TE panels. Finally, it is the novel concept of the slot-connection that, whilst appearing to clamp the GRAF structure inside the slot, actually enables the design to increase the twist angle {{at the tip of the}} fin without overstressing the materials. In order to enhance the GRAF efficiency, a tailored design of the fin structure was conducted. A novel internal structure configuration integrated with the key components has been designed to be connected to a flexible cladding skin, rotating ribs and a load-carrying tubular beam all of which constitute the primary parts of the GRAF model. With the ultimate goal of a lighter tail version, the entire design has been made by using composite, light frames, in an engineering trade-off of stiffness, elasticity, weight and cost of both glass and carbon fibre laminates. The analysis via 2 -D aerodynamic codes and FEA was conducted to assess and validate the GRAF model and the obtained performance. Static linear elastic analysis has been carried out to verify the structural layout of the novel design subject to strength and stiffness criteria in addition to the fin warping and cambering capabilities. Also an investigation of aeroelastic stability related to steady and unsteady aerodynamic conditions has been carried out during the model analysis phase. The study has shown that although the GRAF divergence and flutter margins are slightly smaller than those of the conventional fin, the design and performance requirements are satisfied within the very challenging objective of a lighter vertical tail structure. The dynamic analysis study has also demonstrated the beneficial effect obtained by damping yawing oscillations when such a self-adaptive structure, compared to a rigid one, can be operated under cross wind circumstances. The manufacturing feasibility and assembly of the GRAF structure has been explored with the construction of a 1 : 1 scale model of the fin prototype. The model has been used as concept demonstrator to assess the functionality of the introduced technical novelties, the ease of manufacturing and the structural weight of the final assembly.

40|$|M. Ing. This {{research}} project was initiated by a well-known international company (MAKRO SA), which had experienced floor joint problems occurring in their industrial floors. Floor joint problems i. e. joint damage and spalling {{of the joint}} area result, {{from a combination of}} construction workmanship and quality control problems, as well as from operational hard wheeled vehicle loading conditions. Damaging and spalling of <b>joint</b> <b>edges</b> are general problems occurring on warehouse floor slabs because of hard wheeled loads trafficking joints. In addition, joint filler detachment from the joint wall surface looks aesthetically poor and leaves the possibility of hygienic problems developing. In the case of MAKRO SA stores, the above problems are not acceptable and should be avoided at all costs. The objective of the report is to investigate solutions {{to solve the problem of}} joint damage in industrial floors due to problems occurring in practice, as described below. Floor <b>joint</b> <b>edge</b> problems are a result of three main reasons. First, subsoil quality. The quality of the subsoil is determined by the compaction effort and type of filler materials used, which in turn determine the amount of deflection that will be detected at <b>joint</b> <b>edges.</b> Subgrade quality determines whether deflection of the top concrete layer will occur. Poor compaction and filler material contributes to excessive deflection occurring due to inadequate support of the concrete floor slabs. Water penetration through the floor slab results in the fines of the subsoil being eroded or washed out, resulting in a less dense material, which will deflect under large vehicle and store racking loads. It is concluded that good quality subsoil conditions will result in less deflection and level irregularities of the top concrete floor slab, resulting in less joint damage and spalling. Secondly, the effect of floor and joint workmanship on damage and <b>joint</b> <b>edge</b> spalling. Level irregularities occur due to poor troweling or floating efforts at the joint area. Poor <b>joint</b> <b>edge</b> workmanship results from incorrect formwork removal from the joint wall resulting in a damaged <b>joint</b> <b>edge</b> and additional spalling of the joint to that occurring from wheel load impact.

Thus this scheme is chosen to enhance the small curved mandibular canal structure. The best choice of the diffusion equation parameters c 1 and c 2, depends on the image noise.
