Prolonged <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> times are found to induce two important changes in the device: (i) a decrease in zinc tin oxide film thickness, and (ii) an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration. The devices prepared without <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> exhibited inferior transistor performances, in comparison to devices in which the active channel layer (zinc tin oxide) was subjected to <b>soft</b> <b>annealing.</b> The highest saturation field-effect mobility - 5. 6 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 with a drain-to-source on-off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 2 × 108 - was achieved {{in the case of}} devices with 10 -min soft-annealed zinc tin oxide thin films as the channel layer.

It was found {{that it is possible}} to reduce the cycle time by 30 % for one furnace, 55 % for one furnace and 72 % for two furnaces. Two separate fullscale tests were made to assess whether the faster <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> procedure was feasible. The tests were performed without any reconstruction of the furnace and were made by continuously vary the speed of the batch inside thefurnace. The temperature in the batch was measured and compared with results from computer simulations of the heating/cooling sequences. The computer simulations were performed in COMSOL. The <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> was evaluated according to the SEP- 520 standard,which means evaluating the microstructure and hardness. The results show that the faster heat treatment could yield lower grades than today but still meet it’s requirements.

Design/methodology/approach: Analytical TEM point analysis with EDAX system attached to Philips CM 20 was used to evaluate the concentration of Mn in the microstructure constituents of the multiphase steel,Findings: The increase in <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> time from 1 - 60 hours at 625 °C increases Mn partitioning between ferrite and cementite and new formed austenite and decreases the rate of the austenite formation during next intercritical annealing in the (α+γ) temperature range at 700 and 750 °C.

The research has been performed according to the trivalent testing plan for two input parameters – temperature in the range between 280 °C and 370 °C and time in the range between 2 and 8 hours. The application of such heat treatment improves the plasticity of the investigated alloy.

40|$|Abstract. Pearlite {{spheroidisation}} of 100 CrMn 6 steel was investigated. This {{process is}} well known and studied during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing.</b> Presented paper describes cementite lamellae fragmentation during accelerated carbide spheroidisation. Mechanism of cementite lamellae fragmentation during conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing</b> depends on carbon and iron diffusion in ferrite-cementite system. On the other hand, accelerated carbide spheroidisation relies on partial pearlite austenitization and backward austenite decomposition. Aim of presented experiments was to examine shape evolution of cementite particles during transition from lamellar to globular form. Pearlite spheroidisation is normally quantified by image analysis of 2 D metallographic section. Conventional metallographic observation was used for globular-lamellar particle ratio estimation. However, whole lamellae observation is necessary for spheroidisation process revelation. Ferrite matrix deep etching and cementite separation was performed to study morphological aspects of acceolerated carbide spheroidisation...|$|R

A newly developed process called ASR (Accelerated Spheroidisation and Refinement) cuts the carbide spheroidisation times several fold, producing considerably finer globular carbides than conventional <b>soft</b> <b>annealing.</b> Finer microstructure also leads to more homogeneous and finer structure after final hardening process. The present paper explores process of the accelerated spheroidisation (ASR) in steel 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 with initial pearlitic structure.

Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated <b>dead</b> <b>soft,</b> half-hard, or hard, where <b>dead</b> <b>soft</b> is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|R

The stiffness of the wires was determined and all experimental data were used in FEA models to rationalize the observed values and mode of debonding. Results: Significant higher load and deflection were found for the most flexible retainers Twisted ligature and <b>Dead</b> <b>Soft</b> Respond. All retainers failed between the wire and composite, which was confirmed by FEA showing the highest stress in the composite around the retainer. The FEA models showed that the amount of composite used for bonding the retainers should be 2 - 4 mm.
