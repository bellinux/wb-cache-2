40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> heads on water {{application}} uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to the allowable maximum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> head would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Small scale farmers, in {{developing}} and in some developed countries, are faced to actual difficulties of applying pesticides accurately and safely on vegetables crops. They mainly use <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> sprayers. As an issue, a small direct injection system based on a five meter's parallel boom layout was designed to improve chemical application. The boom layout was optimised to obtain the same minimal lag time response for the ten nozzles. The dynamic of the system was modelled using SimulinkTM as first order model with delay. Two control strategies were implemented using PID feedback control loops to monitor tracer injection (fluorescing) proportionally to simulated forward speed (from 0. 6 to 1. 2 m/s) and to control the constant <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> (constant carrier flow strategy) or the variable <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> proportionally to the injected chemical amount (variable total flow strategy). Different forward speed changes were induced using steps up and down, ramps, sine waves and sweeps solicitations to evaluate the control feedback.

40|$|This Chapter {{presents}} {{numerical simulation}} on MILD combustion <b>operating</b> at high <b>pressure.</b> Influence of preheat and dilution of oxidizer and <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> on stabilization of MILD combustion are presented. Three different preheat temperatures (1100, 1300 and 1500  K) and three different dilution levels (3, 6 and 9 % O 2) are simulated over an <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> variation from 1  atm to 16  atm. A classical jet in hot coflow burner is considered for this study. Total of 45 cases are simulated and analyzed. Essential characteristics of MILD combustion, i. e., maximum temperature (Tmax), temperature rise (ΔT) and temperature distributions, are analyzed. The distribution of emissions OH and CO are also studied and presented. Well-stabilized MILD combustion is observed for all cases {{except for two}} cases with high preheated (1500  K). Peak temperature is observed to decrease with increasing <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> for a given level of preheat and dilution. OH mass faction is reduced with increasing pressure. The CO emissions show little sensitivity to <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, CO mass fraction is slightly higher at 1  atm <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> as compared to 4 to 16  atm. Since the residence time of reactants increases as the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases, well-stabilized MILD combustion is observed for all highly diluted and low temperature preheat cases (3 % O 2 and 1100  K) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{simulated}} {{results obtained}} through the simple 2 D CFD Species-Transport model with volumetric reactions {{developed in the}} commercial CFD software shows similar behavior observed in experimental studies discussed in literature. The CFD model provides a cost-effective method to developed CLC process and optimum operating conditions. The <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> has {{a negative effect on}} reactor temperatures (fuel and air reactor), and the rate of decrease in reactor temperature increases at higher pressure. The efficacy of CLC process lies on the higher value of two key parameters i.e., purity of carbon dioxide in fuel reactor exhaust and fuel conversion. The carbon dioxide purity in fuel reactor exhaust and fuel conversion increases and decreases respectively, with increase in <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b> The opposite effect of <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> on above two key desired parameters requires a trade-off to select the optimum <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Yak-52, {{like most}} Soviet {{military}} aircraft, {{was designed to}} operate in rugged environments with minimal maintenance. One of its key features, unusual in western aircraft, is its extensive pneumatic system. Engine starting, landing gear, flaps, and wheel brakes are all pneumatically actuated. Spherical storage bottles for air, replenished by an engine driven compressor, are situated behind the rear cockpit and contents displayed on the instrument panels. The <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> is between 10 and 50 bars (145 and 725 psi) and an emergency circuit is reserved for lowering the undercarriage if the normal supply is exhausted or the compressor fails. Additionally both main and reserve bottles can be charged from a port {{on the ground with}} compressed air, usually from a Scuba type air bottle. The ground steering/braking arrangement, especially, takes some adjustment for flyers accustomed to hydraulics, because the aircraft uses differential braking controlled by rudder pedals and a <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> lever on the control stick.|$|R
