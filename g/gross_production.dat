500|$|Tourism {{is now an}} {{important}} source of income for the region, amounting in Concepción Municipio alone to US$296,140, or 7.2% of the annual <b>gross</b> <b>production.</b> An additional US$40,000 or 1% comes from crafts. According to a report published by the [...] "Coordinadora Interinstitucional de la Provincia Velasco" [...] in 2007, 17,381 people visited San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the region, as tourists in 2006. About 30% of them came from outside of Bolivia. The main attraction for tourists are the nearby missions of San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco. Tourism to San Ignacio de Velasco generated 7,821,450 Bolivianos in income in 2006. Tourism income is ostensibly translated to improvements in the infrastructure, although there has been criticism that earmarked funds do not always reach their intended destinations. Other than cultural tourism to the missionary circuit and musical festivals, the region offers many natural attractions like rivers, lagoons, hot springs, caves and waterfalls, although there is no infrastructure to support tourism in this regard.|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{incubation}} time chosen, net or {{gross primary production}} can be estimated. [...] Gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times (1 hour or less), since the loss of incorporated 14C (by respiration and organic material excretion / exudation) will be more limited.

2500|$|The {{methods for}} {{measurement}} of primary production {{vary depending on}} whether gross vs net production is the desired measure, and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus. [...] <b>Gross</b> <b>production</b> is almost always harder to measure than net, because of respiration, which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production (i.e. sugars) {{before they can be}} accurately measured. [...] Also, terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to below-ground organs and tissues, where it is logistically difficult to measure. [...] Shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem.|$|E
60|$|And how short {{could the}} hours of the {{universal}} united workers be made? As short as ever they liked: An hour a day: ten minutes, anything they like; but of course {{with the proviso that}} the shorter the hours the less the total of things produced to be divided. It is true that up to a certain point shortening {{the hours of}} labor actually increases the total product. A ten-hour day, speaking in general terms and leaving out individual exceptions, is probably more productive than a day of twelve. It may very well be that an eight-hour day will prove, presently if not immediately, to be more productive than one of ten. But somewhere the limit is reached and <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> falls. The supply of things in general gets shorter. But note that this itself would not matter much, if somehow and in some way not yet found, the shortening of the production of goods cut out the luxuries and superfluities first. Mankind at large might well trade leisure for luxuries. The shortening of hours with the corresponding changes in the direction of production is really the central problem in social reform. I propose to return to it in the concluding chapter of these papers, but for the present it is only noted in connection with the general scheme of industrial relations.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} {{the effects of the}} meteorological variability on the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea), a coupling between a hydrodynamic model and a biological one is realized. The one-dimensional version of the GHER hydrodynamic model includes heat and momentum exchanges at the air-sea interface. It is coupled with a simple food-web model from the LEPM. A simulation performed with real meteorological data for the year 1985 reproduces reasonably the seasonal phytoplanktonic dynamics and the distribution between diatoms and flagellates. From this simulation, an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m of 46. 4 g C m - 2 year - 1 is computed which is representative of an oligotrophic environment. In order {{to estimate the}} relative effect on the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> of the meteorological variability {{on the one hand and}} of the initial conditions on the other hand, several runs have been performed for the year 1985 with different conditions of light, wind intensity and nitrate initial quantity. The first simulations are performed with daily and monthly mean solar radiation and wind intensity. An averaging of wind intensity yields a decrease in the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> and leads to unrealistic phytoplankton dynamics. It seems then necessary to take into account the 3 -hourly variability of the wind intensity in order to simulate the phytoplankton dynamics with relatively good accuracy. On the other hand, an averaging of the solar radiation leads to an increase in the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production.</b> The following simulations are performed with an increase (decrease) in the solar radiation, the wind intensity or the nitrate initial quantity which are representative of the variability observed in a 5 -year set of meteorological and hydrobiological data (1984 - 1988). An increase in the solar radiation is found to reduce the <b>gross</b> primary <b>production,</b> while an increase in the initial nitrate quantity or the wind intensity leads to a higher <b>gross</b> primary <b>production,</b> and the reverse. In the case of variations of the solar radiation (± 2 %), the simulations give an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m included between 44. 8 and 46. 7 g C m - 2 year - 1, representing a variability of 4 %. With the variations of the surface wind intensity (± 10 %), the runs carry to an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m from 34. 1 to 59. 1 g C m - 2 year - 1, representing a variability of 54 %. The variations of the initial nitrate concentration (± 50 %) lead to an annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> integrated over 200 m between 20. 7 and 69. 8 g C m - 2 year - 1 which represents a variability of 108 %. An analysis of the relationship between the total <b>gross</b> primary <b>production</b> and the annual mean depth of the mixed layer has shown that the deeper the mixed layer is, the higher is the total annual <b>gross</b> primary <b>production...</b>|$|R
