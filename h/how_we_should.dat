500|$|The tritium leak, {{combined}} with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste, had caused Secretary of Energy Federico Peña to fire the lab's previous manager, Associated Universities, Inc. Upon starting as the laboratory's director, Marburger noted the increased importance of health and environmental concerns {{since the beginning of}} the Cold War, stating that [...] "getting the people at Brookhaven to understand that won't be simple, and there may be some disagreement on <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do it, but that's my job." [...] Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory's management. By 2001, when Marburger left to join the Bush administration, local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started.|$|E
500|$|Dalrymple {{advances}} {{that the kind}} of sentimentality that he wishes to draw attention to is [...] "an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason" [...] and which is performed [...] "in full public view". Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on August 26–27. Khánh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they should support him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> run our internal affairs." [...] Feeling pressured by the strong condemnations of his colleagues, Khánh promised to resign, but no replacement was agreed upon and another meeting was convened.|$|E

2500|$|Plato's Problem is {{the term}} given by Noam Chomsky to [...] "the problem of {{explaining}} how we can know so much" [...] given our limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this {{is referred to as}} the [...] "argument from poverty of the stimulus" [...] (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always [...] "underdetermined by evidence". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of moral {{responsibility}} in view of climate change. It assumes that {{we have a responsibility to}} future generations, and it inquires what this responsibility implies. The leading idea is that in order to determine what implications responsibility to future generations has, we need to consider what normative questions <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ask about climate change and about our response to it. Four normative questions are discussed. 1. <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> respond to uncertainty? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> apply cost-benefit analysis in order to cope with uncertainty? 2. <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> evaluate the emission of greenhouse gases? Given that the effects of emissions will be bad, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> judge that we as emitters harm the receivers and by that do them an injustice? 3. <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> compare present costs and future benefits? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> give little or much weight to the benefits and well-being of people in the further future? 4. <b>How</b> <b>should</b> <b>we</b> take heed of human rights? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> try to avoid the adverse outcomes of a cost-benefit approach by adopting a human rights approach that specifies minimum thresholds to which all human beings are entitled...|$|R

I {{understand}} why there's a lot of public sympathy for her; I would simply say that I hope justice is done and it's a fair and true verdict ... I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> handle , we would react very angrily to that."

It {{is not at all clear}} <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. [...] It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. [...] But it is important to recognize why this is so—it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms." [...] He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam.|$|E

Khánh said that he would resign, but no agreement over the leadership could be found, and after more arguing between the senior officers, on 27 August they agreed that Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the triumvirate did little due to their disunity. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II {{broke out}} in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{returned}} Stimson to his post {{at the head of}} the War Department. The choice of Stimson, a conservative Republican, was a calculated effort by the president to win bipartisan support for what was considered an almost inevitable US entrance into the war. Ten days before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson entered in his diary the following statement: [...] " [...] brought up the event that we are likely to be attacked perhaps next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was what we should do. The question was <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves." [...] During the war, Stimson oversaw a great expansion of the military including the conscription and training of 13 million soldiers and airmen, and the purchase and transportation of 30% of the nation's industrial output to battlefields [...] He worked closely with his top aides Robert P. Patterson (who succeeded Stimson as Secretary), Robert Lovett (who handled the Air Force), Harvey Bundy and John J. McCloy (Assistant Secretary of War).|$|E
