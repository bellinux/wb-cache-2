500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} area that forms {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. This has two parts—an <b>input</b> <b>area</b> called the pars compacta and an output area the pars reticulata. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). [...] In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the nigrostriatal pathway, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of motor function and in learning new motor skills. [...] These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage, and when a large number of them die, the result is a parkinsonian syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of continuous presses is the [...] "continuous" [...] sequence that allows {{large volumes of}} grapes to be pressed with minimum labor involvement. Instead of pressing separate batches {{that need to be}} emptied and refilled, continuous press typically have an <b>input</b> <b>area</b> and some mechanism (such as an auger screw or belt) that transfers the grapes through the pressings with an output area for the discarded cake. The throughput is limited by the capacity of the tank and the diameter of the screw or width of the belts. Many models of continuous screw presses can process from 50 to upwards of a 100 metric tonnes an hour. This can be a significant advantage for a high volume winery compared to batch presses that often only process 1 to 5 tonnes an hour.|$|E

It is the first and only Tungsten to use a 416 MHz Intel XScale PXA270 processor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma thesis is to {{introduce}} a basic summary of landscape connectivity calculations mainly focusing on the Conefor program {{and the effect of}} input parameters on output landscape connectivity indices. One of the main goals is to create an ArcMap Toolbox to simplify the calculation of landscape connectivity indices for many areas of interest. Basic squares that cover the whole Czech Republic were chosen as main areas of interest. These units are used for example for mapping the abundance of flora and fauna. The same indices were calculated for NUTS 3 and LAU 1 areas in order to compare effect of size of <b>input</b> <b>areas.</b> This thesis provides a simple solution {{in the form of a}} Python Toolbox for Esri ArcMap to calculate overall indices of landscape connectivity through a Conefor command line application for a large number of <b>input</b> <b>areas.</b> Forest connectivity for different dispersal distances and <b>input</b> <b>areas</b> of interest was calculated with this Toolbox. As an input vector layer of forests, CORINE land cover data from mapping period 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012 were used. Input dispersal distances were chosen in the range from 50 to 50. 000 meters in order to comprehensively describe their effects on indices. Resultant forest and connectivity changes are represented by cartograms; the effect of input data on output indices is shown in graphs...|$|R

50|$|Scratch input is an {{enabling}} input {{technique that}} is used in multitude of applications. The earliest application was a highly expressive musical instrument (Mann et al.) for use with mobile devices on natural objects, surfaces, or the like, as a non-synthesizing (i.e. idiophonic) musical instrument.

40|$|Studies on the occurrence, {{abundance}} {{and diversity of}} free living nematodes of the Bonny and New Calabar estuaries were carried out to provide baseline information {{on the nature of}} petroleum activity. Twenty-one sample stations were established to cover the polyhaline, mesohaline and oligohaline ecological zones of both rivers. At each station, sediments were collected and processed for the extraction of nematodes. The nematodes extracted were identified, counted and the data obtained were computed using diversity indices to determine and compare nematode abundance/density, species similarity, evenness and faunal dominance within and between ecological zone in each river system and between the two river systems as well as the petroleum and municipal waste input stations. A total of 36 species were encountered in the Bonny estuary, 31 in the New Calabar estuary and 29 species in the human activity <b>input</b> <b>areas.</b> The highest densities were obtained in the oligohaline zone of both rivers and the human activity <b>input</b> <b>areas.</b> Dominant species in both Bonny and New Calabar rivers were Anoplostoma sp; Teristus pertenuis, Belbolla sp.; Geomonhystera and Oncholaimus paralangrunensis, Sabatieria lonispinosasp, Terschellingia longicudate, Sabatieria vugaris, Sphaerolaimus albidum an...|$|R

50|$|Luminescent solar {{concentrators}} convert sunlight {{or other}} sources of light into preferred frequencies; they concentrate the output for conversion into desirable forms of power, such as electricity. They rely on luminescence, typically fluorescence, in media such as liquids, glasses, or plastics treated with a suitable coating or dopant. The structures are configured to direct the output from a large <b>input</b> <b>area</b> onto a small converter, where the concentrated energy generates photoelectricity. The objective is to collect light over a large area at low cost; luminescent concentrator panels can be made cheaply from materials such as glasses or plastics, while photovoltaic cells are high-precision, high-technology devices, and accordingly expensive to construct in large sizes.|$|E

40|$|A geomorphological, sedimentological, stratigraphic, and {{geometric}} {{study of}} 30 trenches excavated around FLK Zinj (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge) has enabled the partial {{reconstruction of the}} paleolandscape surrounding this site for a radius of similar to 1000 m. This is the largest sample of geological and archaeological information yet available to reconstruct the topography, ecology, and geomorphology of the Zinj paleosurface and the hominin activities preserved within it. Contrary to previous interpretations, which place FLK Zinj on an isolated and narrow peninsula, {{it appears that the}} site was located on the edge of an elevated platform traceable for hundreds of meters. Hominins created FLK Zinj (and other sites, such as the recently discovered PTK and AMK) within the wooded habitats of this platform rather than the more open and grassy environments situated on lower portions of the lacustrine floodplain. <b>Input</b> <b>areas,</b> probably in the form of alluvial fans, existed to the south, following a North-South direction. These <b>input</b> <b>areas</b> are partially responsible for changes in the type sequence. Restricted erosion documented on the wooded platform was mostly caused by runoff processes. An archaeological study of the excavated trenches reveals a sharp contrast in fossil and stone tool density between FLK Zinj and the surrounding landscape, further supporting the contention that the site may have acted as a "central place" where repeated carcass transport, butchery, and consumption took place. Taphonomic studies indicate that at this stage of human evolution, hominins had primary access to carcasses and were not dependent on other carnivores for obtaining meat...|$|R

To a first approximation, the concentration factor of such an LSC is proportional to the area of the input surfaces divided by the area of the edges multiplied by the efficiency of diversion of incoming light towards the output area. Suppose that the glass sheet could divert incoming light from the face towards the edges with an efficiency of 50%. The hypothetical sheet of glass in our example would give an output irradiance of light 5 times greater than that of the incident light, producing a concentration factor of 5.|$|E
