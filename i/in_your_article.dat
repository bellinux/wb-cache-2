60|$|Dear Mr. Chorley,--I hope it {{will not}} be transgressing very much against the {{etiquette}} of journalism, or against the individual delicacy which is of more consequence to both of us, if I venture to thank you by one word for the pages which relate to me in your excellent article in the 'New Quarterly.' It is not my habit to thank or to remonstrate with my reviewers, and indeed I believe I may tell you that I never wrote to thank anyone before on these grounds. I could not thank anyone for praising me--I would not thank him for praising me against his conscience; and if he praised me to the measure of his conscience only, I should have little (as far as the praise went) to thank him for. Therefore I do not thank you for the praise <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>article,</b> but for the kind cordial spirit which pervades both praise and blame, for the willingness in praising, and for the gentleness in finding fault; for the encouragement without unseemly exaggeration, and for the criticisms without critical scorn. Allow me to thank you for these things and for the pleasure I have received by their means. I am bold to do it, because I hear that you confess the reviewership; and am the bolder, because I recognised your hand in an act of somewhat similar kindness in the 'Athenaeum' at the first appearance of the poems.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of goitre {{has long been}} known in Sarawak. Our general impression indicates that goitre is common in the interior regions particularly in areas bordering Indonesia, extremely common in the Lubok Antu District of the Second Division, but quite rare in the coastal areas, municipalities and bigger towns where wide access to sea foods is possible. Although the interior region as characterised by the hilly and mountainous terrain is more than fifty (50) percent of the Sarawak land area, it holds only 10 - 15 percent of the total population. Taking this fact into account, the general goitre prevalence rate would not be as high as portrayed.

In your opinion, is there a link between educational fundamentalism and labelling multilingual subjects as ‘other’? AL: It’s a good question. Let’s begin by saying that literacy crises and these whole cycles of ‘blame the school, blame the teacher, blame falling standards of literacy ’ arise in times of economic, cultural and social disruption. Literacy was in crisis even at its inception. In the fourth century BCE, Socratic dialogue was under threat and Plato was upset {{by the emergence of}} the alphabet. Eighteen centuries later, the emergence of the printing press led to another crisis. It threw the clergy, the scriptoria and those who controlled texts and the archive into chaos by introducing the idea that everyone can and should read. In the last fifty years, television, new technologies and shifts in the economy have contributed to a continual discourse of crisis. These are variations on what Habermas (1975) referred to...|$|E

40|$|Dear Sir,I {{read your}} {{editorial}} article ‘New measures {{taken for a}} better IJAV’ [1] {{and it seems that}} you have taken a wise decision for following up of the journal. As Prof. Nayak opined [2], having a processing fee for publication may discourage many authors, but {{in order to maintain the}} publication expenditures, editorial office and handling of higher number of manuscripts, you might have taken these steps. Since IJAV is an open access electronic journal, getting subscription fees from the institutions and universities is not possible. The anatomical variants are commonly encountered in day to day practice and are submitted to the journals for publication. But this is not that often with the original communications and review articles. In view of this, it may be difficult to manage a journal like IJAV as it is the only journal exclusively [3] made for publishing anatomical variations and clinical anatomy case reports. Waiving the processing fee for the authors from poor countries and students is an encouragement from the editor. Regarding the decision to provide incentives for the peer reviewers, instead of providing the money; it may be more suitable to issue a certificate from the editorial board for reviewing the case. It may help to decrease the amount of processing charge paid by the author. It’s a good idea to restrict the number of authors since most of the other reputed journal editors have opined that the authorship criteria for the case report should be four or less than four. I am very happy that IJAV has published more than hundreds of case reports within a short span of years. The map overlay of web traffic of IJAV via Google Analytics [1], which is displayed <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>article,</b> is informative and I am proud that our country ‘India’ is on higher traffic [1].

40|$|I {{am writing}} this letter in {{response}} to article “Nursing Shortage: A Comparative Analysis ” which made me think about the similar situation of my country. I am from Nepal, a developing country which is facing the nursing shortage as you have mentioned in the article. If you ask a nursing student in my country, {{what are you going}} to do after graduating? Most of those answers would be going abroad for bachelor or masters. Here, doing bachelor or masters means they want to get blended with the students of the respective country for licensure and degree equivalence so that they could easily get a permanent visa of that country. As you have mentioned <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>article</b> about Philippines that they are educating more nurses than they need, we have a same situation in my country too. The number of nursing college is increasing so is the number of nurses. There is less demand and more supply of nurses to the health care system. Another major problem we are facing is due to political instability, the governing bodies are malfunctioning which affects the quality of education provided to our nurses, resulting in quality of care they provide to their patients. The real problem actually starts after graduation. Nurses are not able to find jobs. They are asked about their experience, which new nurses would not have. Nowadays there is a trend of volunteering by nurses, which are forced by hospital administrations so that the nurses could get a job in that hospital. Poor Nurses could only see their option of moving abroad and have a better life. The most important reason of moving to develop countries is the money. Nepalese nurses hardly make $ 250 a month, which makes you difficult to survive in the country. Even if you have a bachelor or masters de-gree you would be making about $ 300 comparing the USA nurse making $ 60, 000 a year. This situation makes the nurses in my country very motivated and they want to try everything possible to go to developed countries and have a fascinated lifestyle. © 2012 International Journal of Nursing This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licens...|$|E

40|$|I {{write to}} commend the {{decision}} taken by WHO as <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>article</b> to Halt rising numbers of female tobacco users in poor nations, urges WHO, by John Zarocostas. BMJ 2010; 340 :c 2956. As {{a person who}} has lived and worked in a tobacco growing area of my country, Uganda, I have vividly seen many of the dangers of tobacco, from growing it, to using it by chewing and smoking it in even the unprocessed forms. I have seen women, girls, boys and men waste their livelihoods in what I could term the ‘tobacco mess’. It saddened me because as a health worker (Nurse) working in that region at that time, I knew what they were headed for – disaster. Most heart breaking was that the government was busy praising the tobacco industry for the ‘great revenue’. Many governments, through their ministries of health, are in the know of all these issues and have tried to regulate them by putting policies in place to curb the situation. But because they pick the revenue with one hand it becomes difficult to sanction ‘meaningful’ policies with the other hand. The end result usually is unenforced policies, and many poor nations have a lot of these. This is worsened by the aggressive marketing policies of the tobacco industry. It’s a commendable decision that the World Health Organization has called for concerted global action to curb the rising numbers of female tobacco users, especially in poor nations. My concern is that this good move may eventually be watered down by the fact that these poor nations are blinded by the revenue from the tobacco industry and may not dare develop meaningful policies to curb the rising numbers of female tobacco users. The tobacco industry may also be threatened because this call may result in an overall reduction of their clientele, both female and male. The tobacco industry may therefore design more complex ways to keep the female tobacco users and even recruit more, both female and male. I therefore encourage and call upon the World Health Organization to design serious strategies to governments of these poor nations to comply and curb rising numbers of female tobacco users...|$|E
