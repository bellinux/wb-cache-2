Several family members travelled {{back and forth between the}} farmhouse and the fields, passing the Drummonds on several occasions. The Dominicis irrigated their alfalfa field using water from the Manosque Canal, which crosses over the railway track.

He noticed a camp bed in front of the Drummonds' car, as well as a canvas that covered the car's windscreen and right side windows. At 4.50 am, a Joseph Moynier passed the scene and did not notice any of this. At 5.20 am, a Jean Hébrard noticed a camp bed leaning against the car.

40|$|Abstract — Solar <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> is {{this type}} of device which uses solar energy for water pumping. Water pumping is an energy {{intensive}} activity and consumes a large amount man power, diesel and electricity. Smallholder farmers in low income countries can benefit from affordable <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> systems as they enable cultivation of high value crops during dry season. Currently the majority of small irrigation pumps are manually operated which is time consuming and requires {{a high level of}} physical exertion. There is a potential market for a low cost solar thermal pump that produces a high volume of water as well as reducing the labour burden. This will allow more crops to be grown and free up time for other productive tasks. Compared to the existing manual systems, many hours could be saved each day through reduced labour input...|$|E
40|$|As {{an intern}} with Byrne Medical Inc., I {{took part in}} several {{development}} and validation projects for medical products. A design project for a medical <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> for endoscopic procedure is the focus for my Doctor of Engineering degree. This project represents the scope and depth of a typical design project for a medical device. In this dissertation, a summary of motors used in current medical irrigation pumps available in the market, {{as well as their}} flow rates, is presented. A procedure of typical product design process is followed and a working prototype of endoscopic <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> is designed and fabricated. The objective of the project was to design and fabricate a working prototype of a medical <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> to be used for endoscopic procedures with standard videoscopes in the medical field. Currently there are no irrigation pumps that satisfy physicians?????? needs. By manufacturing their own pump, Byrne Medical would be able to select a host of the positive features noted on other pumps and combine those features into a single pump that fits both the technical and user needs. The author made improvements in the areas of appearance, size, usability, functionality, product life, and ability to vary motor speed, and therefore the flow rate. Flow rate of the prototype was tested by measuring the amount of water it was able to pump per minute (milliliter per minute). Each tubing set was attached and secured onto the prototype unit and adjust the speed control to the maximum flow. The power switch was turned on and the pump was running continuously for twenty seconds. Water was collected and weighted with a digital scale. The amount of water (in pounds) per twenty seconds was then converted to milliliter per minute. Physicians in the GI (Gastroenterology) suites prefer an <b>irrigation</b> <b>pump</b> that rotates backward when they turn the power off to prevent the sterile water from dripping. A Multi-function Timer (model H 3 DE-M 2) manufactured by Omron was selected for future improvement. A working prototype (previously fabricated) was tested with this DPDT timer and the result proved the improvement was achievable...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, <b>irrigation</b> <b>pumping</b> {{plants have}} been tested using an {{instantaneous}} appraoch, which tests performance parameters over {{a very short time}} interval. Using this method, the tester measures the necessary work and energy use parameters to calculate the desired pumping plant performance values. The primary limitation of this approach is its inability to determine the season long efficiency of an <b>irrigation</b> <b>pumping</b> plant. A new approach to evaluating <b>irrigation</b> <b>pumping</b> plant performance is the use of pump monitoring systems which use high frequency, real-time data collection and telemetry to relay information directly from the pump to the user. This method of testing essentially conducts a continuous pumping plant performance evaluation. Throughout a typical irrigation season, a single pumping plant typically operates at a wide range of total dynamic heads as a result of changes in operational conditions due to factors such as aquifer drawdown and irrigation demand changes. When coupled with telemetry, this approach to <b>irrigation</b> <b>pumping</b> plant testing can provide real-time feedback to the irrigator on pumping plant performance, even as the operating conditions of the system changes throughout the season. Nearly 100 pumping years of diesel and electric pumping plant data was evaluated over four irrigation seasons using a network of these pump monitoring systems. Annual averages and trends in water pumping flow rate, cost of water per unit volume pumped, and efficiency {{as a percentage of the}} Nebraska Pumping Plant Performance Criteria, among other performance values were reported. These pumping performance values can be used to develop recommendations to producers in order to improve pumping plant performance and reduce operating costs as well as identifying the causes of pumping plant inefficiencies...|$|R
