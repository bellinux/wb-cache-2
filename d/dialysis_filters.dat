The {{objective of this}} study was to develop and test search filters to help physicians efficiently retrieve literature related to dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) from all other articles indexed in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase. Design, setting, participants, & measurementsA diagnostic test assessment framework was used to develop and test robust <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters.</b> The reference standard was a manual review of the full texts of 22, 992 articles from 39 journals to determine whether each article contained dialysis information. Next, 1, 623, 728 unique search filters were developed, and their ability to retrieve relevant articles was evaluated. Results The high-performance <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters</b> consisted of up to 65 search terms in combination. These terms included the words “dialy ” (truncated), “uremic, ” “catheters, ” and “renal transplant wait list. ” These filters reached peak sensitivities of 98. 6 % and specificities of 98. 5 %. The filters ’ performance remained robust in an independent validation subset of articles.

40|$|Citrate, as an {{anticoagulant}} {{for continuous}} renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, has some potential advantages over heparin, including a prolonged <b>dialysis</b> <b>filter</b> life and reduced risk of bleeding. The key parameter involved in monitoring the adequacy {{and safety of}} citrate anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy pertains to the ionised and total plasma calcium levels. We report a case of severe systemic hypocalcaemia during continuous renal replacement therapy with citrate anticoagulation resulting from relentless sequestration of calcium due to undiagnosed evolving rhabdomyolysis. Although excessive systemic citrate accumulation can also cause hypocalcaemia, this complication was not observed in our patient. While an acceptable lower limit of ionised calcium remains unknown, severe rhabdomyolysis needs to be considered when a patient's ionised calcium levels are not responsive to standard calcium replacement therapy during continuous renal replacement therapy using citrate anticoagulation in critically ill patients...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} long-term hemodialysis (HD) exhibit {{increased levels}} of oxidative stress, likely contributing to the increased rate of cardiovascular disease. The present study represents a critical evaluation {{of some of the}} most widely used oxidative indicators, as applied to the monitoring of hemodialysis-associated oxidative stress. Total plasma antioxidant capacity was determined by two independent procedures, the total antioxidant status (TAS) and the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) methods. Plasma lipid peroxidation was assessed by determining the peroxidation products malonaldehyde and 4 -hydroxynonenal (MDA- 4 HNE) as well as lipid hydroperoxides ("Fox- 2 " and "d-ROMs" methods). Total plasma thiols and plasma alpha-tocopherol were also determined. MDA- 4 HNE levels were higher in HD patients and decreased following HD, possibly due to passive diffusion across <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters.</b> d-ROMs were also higher in HD patients but exhibited a further increase following the dialysis procedure. Serum alpha-tocopherol did not show any significant differences. Plasma thiols were lower in HD patients and were restored following HD. Plasma total antioxidant capacity determined with either method was unexpectedly higher in HD patients compared to controls, and decreased following HD. These data indicate that, of the biomarkers studied, d-ROMs level is the one more accurately reflecting the oxidative alterations taking place in HD patients, while determination of MDA- 4 HNE fails to detect oxidation occurring during the HD sessions. In addition, our findings point out that the determination of total antioxidant capacity in HD patients is severely affected by the concomitant fluctuations in plasma urate levels and therefore needs careful interpretation...|$|E

The protective role of vitamin E as a lipophilic antioxidant against oxidative stress has been widely investigated. Here we investigated {{the effects of a}} vitamin E-coated regenerated cellulose hollow fiber dialyzer (CL-EE) on oxidative stress compared with a polysulfone hollow fiber (CL-PS). MethodsFor at least three months before beginning the protocol, 10 nondiabetic (NDM) patients (70. 0 ± 7. 5 years; 6 males and 4 females) and 8 diabetic (DM) patients (65. 0 ± 7. 4 years; 4 males, 4 females) were dialyzed with CL-PS. After that, we treated all of the patients with CL-EE for six months. Malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) were monitored as biomarkers for oxidative stress at the start and then at one, three, and six months into treatment with CL-EE. ResultsSerum MDA, AGE, and 8 -OHdG levels increased after the hemodialysis with CL-PS. The increase of the biomarkers was completely prevented by a single use of CL-EE. Long-term hemodialysis with CL-EE for six months significantly reduced the basal levels of the oxidant markers at one month for AGE and at six months for 8 -OHdG in both DM and NDM patients. Serum MDA was reduced in only DM patients at three months. The improvement of the oxidative stress with CL-EE was more prominent in the DM patients. ConclusionsLong-term treatment with CL-EE efficiently improves the oxidative stress associated with hemodialysis and potentially reduces dialysis complications due to oxidative stress...|$|E

The present study evaluated the use of argatroban as an anticoagulant during continuous RRT in the early period after cardiac surgery. Argatroban was compared with unfractionated heparin (UH) with respect to bleeding complications {{and the effectiveness of}} anticoagulation. MethodsPatients requiring RRT after cardiac surgery from March 2007 to June 2009 were identified. The effectiveness of anticoagulation was measured indirectly by the duration of <b>dialysis</b> <b>filter</b> use. Bleeding was defined as clinical signs of blood loss or the need for transfusion. ResultsOf 94 patients, 41 received argatroban, 27 UH, and 26 required conversion from UH to argatroban. In all 3 subgroups, RRT was begun within a median postoperative period of 2. 0 days. Similar levels of anticoagulation were achieved with the duration of the circuit and filter changed an average of 1. 1 times daily during RRT. Liver function was comparable in all patients. Neither clinically relevant signs of bleeding nor significant differences in the hemoglobin levels or a requirement for transfusion were noted. However, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II values during dialysis and mortality were significantly greater in the patients initially receiving argatroban compared with those who received UH alone (54 ± 2 vs 43 ± 3, P < . 001; 71 % vs 44 %, P = . 04). ConclusionsArgatroban can provide effective anticoagulation in postoperative cardiac patients receiving continuous RRT.

In this study, we tested the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the addition to different commercial devices of a packaged polysulphone fibers filter. We aimed to find a simple solution to implement {{the quality of the}} delivered water. Water contamination levels were determined in a wide selection of microfiltered water dispensers and we selected among them a representative group of 10 devices, new or in use. The packaged ultrafilter was introduced in about half of them, to monitor, when possible, in parallel the contamination levels and flow rate of a couple of identical units, with and without the filter. The placement of the <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters</b> resulted feasible at different positions along the water circuits of the variously designed filtration units. Delivered water resulted completely free from bacteria when the filter was placed exactly at, or very close to, the outlet in spite of the inner surfaces contamination. This performance was not obtained in presence of a more or less long tract of water circuits downstream the ultrafilter: a significant but not complete reduction of the plate count numbers was observed. The filters worked in continue over the whole study period, ten months, showing exactly the same efficiency. Moreover, the flow rate in presence of the filter was quite unaffected.

40|$|AIM: This {{doctoral}} thesis {{focuses on the}} measurement of efficiency and effectiveness {{in the health care}} sector, and the chosen field of study is end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Greece. The specific objectives are: i) To measure, at the health system level (macro-level), technical and scale efficiency of dialysis units and to perform a longitudinal productivity analysis, while concurrently focusing on the observed differences between {{the public and private sectors}} and ii) To compare, at the medical intervention level (micro-level), the effectiveness of the three known modalities of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT), namely in-center hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (Tx). MATERIAL AND METHODS: All dialysis units operating in Greece from 1993 (N= 73) to 2004 (N= 124) were involved in the measurement of efficiency. Non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used with two inputs, nurses and dialysis machines and one output, the annual number of dialysis sessions. Technical and scale efficiency were determined for every unit in each of the study years, by implementing variable and constant returns to scale (VRS, CRS), input oriented DEA models. Total Factor Productivity was measured with Malmquist’s index which was decomposed into three components indicating changes in pure technical efficiency, scale efficiency and technology. Effectiveness of RRT methods was determined with cost-utility analysis (CUA). A representative sample of patients on HD (N= 642), PD (N= 65) and Tx (N= 167) were self-administered the KDQOL-SF (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form) instrument, incorporating the generic QoL instrument SF- 36, from which the preference-based SF- 6 D utility index was derived. Utilities were also obtained from direct methods, namely visual analog scale (VAS), time tradeoff (TTO) and standard gamble (SG), and patients’ willingness-to-pay for a kidney transplant was measured. Lifelong QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years) were calculated by considering individual expected remaining life years. HD and PD cost analysis was performed from the societal perspective, whereas the cost of Tx was adopted from a reimbursement proposal formulated by the Hellenic National Transplant Organization. In the CUA, both cost and QALYs were discounted at a common rate of 5 %. RESULTS: The DEA VRS models, for the twelve study years, produced efficiency scores ranging from 66, 18 % to 74, 19 %. Differences are observed between the public and private sectors, with scores varying between 62, 3 - 70, 5 % and 75, 0 - 89, 7 % respectively. The CRS models logically produced lower scores for all units (39, 5 - 53, 5 %). The scores from the VRS and CRS models are statistically significant different (P< 0, 001), implying the coexistence of scale inefficiencies, and these were found to vary between 25, 1 % και 40, 9 %. The Malmquist productivity index, for the study period, ranged from 0. 957 and 1. 040 implying annual productivity fluctuations of approximately ± 4, 0 %, usually following the pattern of the public dialysis units. However, the efficiency change and technological change components differed by up to 30 % in cases. The basic psychometric properties, reliability and validity, of the KDQOL-SF instrument were confirmed. In all generic and disease-specific scales, transplanted patients reported better health (P< 0, 001), whereas the observed differences between HD and PD patients where statistically insignificant. SF- 6 D utilities demonstrated better validity and sensitivity compared to those derived form VAS, TTO and SG, and were chosen as QALY weights in the CUA. SF-FD scores were 0, 639 (HD), 0, 599 (PD) and 0, 716 (Tx) (P< 0, 001). The annual cost per patient for HD and PD was 36. 247, 33 € and 30. 719, 25 € respectively. The cost of Tx was calculated separately for the first year and for three years after the operation, at 31. 713, 67 € and 42. 944, 39 € respectively. Cost per QALY is higher in HD (60. 353, 03 €) compared to PD (54. 503, 50 €) and 1 st year Tx (45. 522, 66 €). CONCLUSIONS: There is noteworthy space for improvement of technical efficiency in the dialysis sector in Greece, mostly by optimizing the use of nursing staff and dialysis machines. This does not necessarily imply reducing these inputs, but rather distributing them more rationally. Furthermore, the production scale of most dialysis units requires reconsideration due to existing scale inefficiencies. The abovementioned are also reflected in the trends of the Malmquist productivity index over a twelve-year period. At the medical intervention level, the relatively higher cost of HD is the main justification for its higher resulting cost/QALY compared to PD and Tx. Considering that HD is used by 75 % of the ESRD patients in Greece, efforts to reduce these costs must be intensified. This obviously involves reconsidering policies pertinent to the supply and reimbursement of <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters</b> and medication, the potential of establishing satellite dialysis units and the adoption of telemedicine in remote areas, just to mention a few. It is also obvious that a more widespread use of PD is a step in the direction of increasing cost-effectiveness. However the ultimate means of therapy is renal transplantation and conscientious efforts are required for disseminating the idea of organ donation. ...|$|E
40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used treatment for end-stage renal disease. Despite all efforts to improve the outcomes, the mortality of patients on HD is still high, and this especially is related to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Glucose degradation products accumulate in plasma and tissue as a result of oxidative stress in these patients. Such accumulation is strongly related to the risk of developing CVD. Tissue deposits of advanced glycation end products (AGE) can be easily assessed by a skin autofluorescence (SAF) technique. SAF is one of the strongest prognostic markers of mortality in HD patients. The aim of this thesis is to examine whether intervention on HD treatment can reduce the load of AGE of these patients. The aim of the first study was to investigate whether changes in SAF appear after a single HD session and if they might be related to changes in plasma AF. Skin and plasma AF (PAF) were measured before and after HD in 35 patients on maintenance HD therapy. Median dialysis time was 4 [*]h (range 3 - 5. 5). SAF was measured noninvasively with an AGE Reader, and plasma AF was measured before and after HD. The HD patients had on average a 65 % higher SAF value than age-matched healthy persons (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). PAF was reduced by 14 % (P[*]<[*] 0. 001), whereas SAF was not changed after a single HD treatment. No significant influence of the reduced PAF on SAF levels was found. This suggests that the measurement of SAF can be performed during the whole dialysis period and is not directly influenced by the changes in plasma AF during HD. In study 2 different <b>dialysis</b> <b>filters</b> were compared to clarify whether using a high-flux (HF) dialyzer favors plasma or SAF removal compared to low-flux (LF) dialyzer. Twenty-eight patients were treated with either an HF-HD or LF-HD but otherwise unchanged conditions in a cross-over design. SAF was measured non-invasively with an AGE reader before and after HD. PAF was determined as total and non-protein-bound fractions. Corrections for hemoconcentrations by volume changes were made using the change in serum albumin. Paired and non-paired statistical analyses were used. The different treatments did not change SAF after LF- and HF-dialysis. Total, free, and protein-bound PAF were reduced after a single LF-HD by 21 %, 28 %, and 17 %, respectively (P<. 001). After HF-HD total and free PAF was reduced by 5 % and 15 %, respectively (P<. 001), while protein-bound values were unchanged. The LF-HD resulted in a more pronounced reduction of PAF than did HF-HD (P<. 001). Serum albumin correlated inversely with PAF in HF-HD. There was no significant change in SAF after dialysis, either with LF or with HF dialysis. Although only limited reductions in PAF were observed, these were more pronounced when performing LF dialysis. These data are not in overwhelming support of the use of HF dialysis in the setting used in this study. In the third study the effect on SAF was investigated using either glucose-containing or glucose-free dialysate. SAF and PAF were measured in patients on HD during standard treatment with a glucose-containing dialysate (n= 24). After that, the patients were switched to a glucose-free dialysate for a 2 week period, and new measurements were performed on PAF and SAF. There was an increase of pre-dialysis SAF measured {{at the beginning of the}} study compared with the values one month later (as in study 4). By comparing pre- and post-dialysis values there was a significant decrease of SAF only when using glucose-free dialysate. Free PAF decreased independently whether glucose-containing or glucose-free dialysate was used. The important finding was that increase in SAF seemed possible to slow down using glucose-free dialysate. Study 4 was performed to investigate whether there are seasonal variations in SAF on a HD population. SAF was measured non-invasively with an AGE Reader in patients on HD at different seasonal periods during one year such as February-May (N= 31), May–August (N= 28), August–March (N= 25). SAF was measured before HD. Paired statistical analyses were performed between each two periods.   Unexpectedly there was at a median 6 % increase in SAF during the winter (p= 0. 004) and a 11 % decrease from 4. 0 to 3. 5 arbitrary units of the SAF during the summer (p< 0. 001). The study concluded that SAF shows seasonal variation. The cause of these changes could not be clarified. A beneficial effect may be due to extended exposure to sunlight during the summer and/or to different dietary intakes during the seasons. In conclusion, these interventional studies confirmed that PAF is lowered by dialysis. SAF was only decreased by HD when using glucose-free dialysate. SAF was not influenced by a single HD, with glucose-containing dialysate, independent of using HF or LF filters. These data favor glucose-free dialysate as a possible measure to slow down the progress of tissue AGE compared to glucose-containing dialysate. Longitudinal studies will help to clarify this issue further...|$|E

In leaching experiments lithium was softly dissolved from the fish bone by shaking with a 0. 1 mol/l hydrochloric acid or a 0. 1 mol/l acetic acid solution after washing and removing the surface sea-water on the fish with water. The lithium leached in the acid solutions and remained to the residue was determined by flame photometry using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer with air-acetylene flame, after the decomposition with nitric-perchloric acid mixture. In the gill, head and back-bone of anchovy, 73, 71 and 71 % of total lithium were dissolved with 0. 1 mol/l hydrochloric acid, respectively. Same leaching results were obtained for calcium; 78 〜 84 % of total calcium were also dissolved with the same leaching solution.

40|$|Peritoneal Dialysis Fluids of the 21 st century should fulfill major {{clinical}} demands, as {{decrease of}} cardiovascular mortality, peritoneal membrane preservation, adequate dialysis and ultrafiltration {{and maintenance of}} adequate nutrition. The ‘health’ of the peritoneal membrane and its endurance as <b>dialysis</b> <b>filter</b> {{are influenced by the}} uraemic environment and the chronic exposure to peritoneal dialysis fluids. The medical, scientific and industrial societies have mounted a great interest regarding the role of biocompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids on peritoneal dialysis adverse events, as ultrafiltration failure, peritonitis and encapsulated peritoneal sclerosis. Long term exposure to conventional glucose, lactate buffered dialysis fluid may provoke peritoneal damage, by neovascularization, translated clinically as ultrafiltration failure. The most adverse bioincompatible factors of dialysis fluids seem to be the acidic pH, the lactic acid buffer, the glucose, the hyperosmolality, the glucose degradation products and the advanced glycation end products. Long?time research in the biocompatibility field shed new light to the pathophysiology of peritoneal damage in peritonitis and long?term peritoneal dialysis and led to the industrial production of new peritoneal dialysis fluids of alternative osmotic factor and buffer. The ultimate purpose of the ‘newer’ dialysis fluids as opposed to conventional is a ‘healthier’ peritoneum and a ‘long?lived’ method of peritoneal dialysis in the arsenal of renal replacement therapies for end stage renal disease. Biocompatibility research of dialysis fluids, in vitro, in animals and ex vivo, has innate problems of methodology and results’ analysis which leads sometimes to contradictive and non comparable results. On the other hand, we are still lacking long term large clinical randomized clinical trials, which could verify the superiority of new to conventional fluids. We compared new and conventional unused peritoneal dialysis fluids by way of their influence on cytokines’ release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers, with or without stimulation, as a parameter of in vitro biocompatibility. We used an experimental procedure assimilating as much as possible the peritoneal equilibration of pH and osmolality of the peritoneal dwell. Six solutions were examined: Conventional glucose lactate buffered, as isotonic (1. 5 % dextrose) (1), and hypertonic (4. 25 % dextrose) (2) solution. Newer glucose based solutions, pyruvate buffered as isotonic (1. 0 % dextrose) (3) and hypertonic (4. 0 % dextrose) (4) 103 solutions. New solutions of alternative osmotic factor, glucose polymer (5) and amino acid (6), lactate buffered.

Initial incubation in culture flasks for 15 minutes was followed by 1 : 1 dilution with RPMI and by additional incubation for 22 hours as ‘recovery period’. At the end the supernatants were tested for cytokines IL? 6 and TNFα by enzyme?linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL? 6 was chosen as a representative marker of peritoneal inflammatory status and TNFα as a representative cytokine of peritoneal host defense. ...|$|R

Since few data are reported from Brazil, {{our aim was to}} assess the frequency and risk factors for HBV infection in haemodialysis patients from 22 Dialysis Centres from Santa Catarina State, south of Brazil. Methods This study includes 813 patients, 149 haemodialysis workers and 772 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Serum samples were assayed for HBV markers and viraemia was detected by nested PCR. HBV was genotyped by partial S gene sequencing. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses with stepwise logistic regression analysis were carried out to analyse the relationship between HBV infection and the characteristics of patients and their Dialysis Units. Results Frequency of HBV infection was 10. 0 %, 2. 7 % and 2. 7 % among patients, haemodialysis workers and controls, respectively. Amidst patients, the most frequent HBV genotypes were A (30. 6 %), D (57. 1 %) and F (12. 2 %). Univariate analysis showed association between HBV infection and total time in haemodialysis, type of dialysis equipment, hygiene and sterilization of equipment, number of times reusing the <b>dialysis</b> lines and <b>filters,</b> number of patients per care-worker and current HCV infection. The logistic regression model showed that total time in haemodialysis, number of times of reusing the <b>dialysis</b> lines and <b>filters,</b> and number of patients per worker were significantly related to HBV infection. Conclusions Frequency of HBV infection among haemodialysis patients at Santa Catarina state is very high. The most frequent HBV genotypes were A, D and F. The risk for a patient to become HBV positive increase 1. 47 times each month of haemodialysis; 1. 96 times if the dialysis unit reuses the lines and filters ≥ 10 times compared with haemodialysis units which reuse < 10 times; 3. 42 times if the number of patients per worker is more than five. Sequence similarity among the HBV S gene from isolates of different patients pointed out to nosocomial transmission. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Reuse of {{hemodialysis}} filters is {{a standard}} practice and the sterilizing chemical most often employed is peracetic acid. Before starting the <b>dialysis</b> session, <b>filters</b> and lines are checked for residual levels of peracetic acid {{by means of a}} non-quantitative colorimetric test that is visually interpreted. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a new quantitative spectrophotometric test for detection of peracetic acid residues. Methods: Peracetic acid solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 10 ppm. A reagent (potassium-titanium oxide + sulfuric acid) was added to each sample in proportions varying from 0. 08 to 2. 00 drops/mL of solution. Optical densities were determined in a spectrophotometer using a 405 -nm filter and subjected to visual qualitative test by different observers. Results: A relation between peroxide concentrations and respective optical densities was observed and it was linear with R 2 > 0. 90 for all reagent/substrate proportions. The peak optical densities were obtained with the reagent/substrate ratio of 0. 33 drops/mL, which was later standardized for all further experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative tests yielded a specificity of 100 %. The quantitative test was more sensitive than the qualitative test and resulted in higher positive and negative predictive values. There was a difference between observers in the qualitative test and some samples with significant amounts of peroxide were not detected. Conclusion: A quantitative spectrophotometric test may improve detection of residues of peracetic acid when compared to the standard visual qualitative test. This innovation may contribute to the development of safer standards for reuse of hemodialysis filters...|$|R

Currently, over 430, 000 people undergo four-hour maintenance hemodialysis (HD) treatments three times a week. HD patients experience {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease partly due to oxidative stress, which previous studies have shown may be remediated with antioxidant therapy. HD patients also experience uremia, an illness that negatively impacts their quality of life. This study was conducted to determine if supplementing HD patients with vitamin C and selenium would increase their levels of plasma vitamin C and the plasma activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thereby improving antioxidant status. Additionally, this study was conducted to determine if supplementation would alleviate the symptoms shared by uremia and vitamin C deficiency, thereby improving quality of life. The 90 -day double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at a dialysis center in Riverside, California with 32 participants who were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three treatment groups: 1) oral vitamin C gummy and selenium capsule; 2) oral vitamin C gummy; and 3) placebo gummy. Plasma vitamin C and GPx activity were measured monthly and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life survey was completed at the start and end of the trial. Compared to the placebo group, the supplemented groups experienced a significant increase in vitamin C levels (p =. 001), suggesting vitamin C therapy and vitamin C combined with selenium therapy may improve the antioxidant status of HD patients; a significant difference between supplemented groups was not observed, however, indicating vitamin C and selenium supplementation combined did not affect vitamin C levels to a greater degree than vitamin C supplementation alone. While there did not appear to be a difference between groups in plasma GPx activity, a significant curvilinear trend was observed in both supplemented groups compared to the placebo group that warrants further investigation.

Studies, analyzing either discrete analytes and antioxidant substances, or the integrated total antioxidant activity of human plasma during hemodialysis, give contradictory results. Methods Recently, we have introduced a new automated method for the determination of Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) of human plasma. We have serially measured TAC and corrected TAC (cTAC: after subtraction of the interactions due to endogenous uric acid, bilirubin and albumin) in 10 patients before the onset of the dialysis session, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h into the procedure and after completion of the session. Results Our results indicate that TAC decreases, reaching minimum levels at 2 h. However, corrected TAC increases with t 1 / 2 of about 30 min. We then repeated the measurements in 65 patients undergoing <b>dialysis</b> with different <b>filters</b> (36 patients with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer resin filter -Eval-, 23 patients with two polysulfone filters - 10 with F 6 and 13 with PSN 140 -, and 6 patients with hemophan filters).

Freshly isolated endothelial cells and subcultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells at different stages of growth to confluence were also tested to see if the previously described βTG receptor had been lost during growth of cells in culture. The effect of γTG or low affinity platelet factor 4 (LA-PF 4), the precursor of βTG, was compared with that of βTG. No inhibitory effects of βTG or γTG were found under these conditions.

40|$|Background and aim: One of the {{morbidity}} and mortality determinants of the dialysis patients is inadequacy of dialysis. Increasing the dialysis efficacy improves patient’s prognosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of increasing blood flow on the adequacy of dialysis in dialysis department of Ekbatan hospital of Hamadan. Methods: This before-after desigh study was performed on 42 patients. First, data was collected about the following parameters: patient’s weight before and after hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, urea before and after hemodialysis, the time of <b>dialysis,</b> percentage of <b>filter</b> clearance and speed of dialysate. Then the patient was attached to the dialysis machine and a sample of blood was taken. The pumpage of dialysis machine in the first session was put on 200 ml/min and in the second session on 250 ml/min. During the hemodialysis, the hemodynamic status and vital signs of patient’s were controlled. When hemodialysis finished a blood sample was taken from the artery set, in a section before dialyzer (4 blood sample for each patients), weight was controlled again and the sample was sent to a laboratory for urea control. Then the efficiency of dialysis was determined. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used for analysis of the data. Results: Results showed the mean KT/V (K=Clearance dialyzer T= Time V=Volume of distribation of urea) of patients whose pumping cycle were 200 ml/min, had 0. 943 ± 0. 335 and URR (Urea Reduction Ratio) 53. 3 ± 13. 5 wereas mean KT/V patients with 250 pumping cycle had 1. 195 ± 0. 45 and URR 60. 17 ± 10. 47.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. Feb. 2011. Major: Applied Economics. Advisors: Dr. Caroline Carlin, Dr. John Nyman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 60 pages, appendices A-E. Although considered a rare disease in 1972 when its treatment {{was added to}} the Medicare program, the incidence and prevalence of total kidney failure, called End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), has grown substantially in the last half-century. There are now over 500, 000 patients with ESRD, comprising about 1 % of all Medicare patients but accounting for over 6 % of total expenditures. There were over 110, 000 incident ESRD patients in 2006, projected to grow to over 150, 000 by the year 2020, with a total of almost 800, 000 ESRD patients by that time (Gilbertson, 2005; USRDS, 2008, Vol 2, Fig 2. 1). Although kidney transplants have become more common, organ shortages as well as the complex disease burden of patients result in the majority of patients having their ESRD treated by clinic-provided hemodialysis (HD). This process, which represents the type of renal replacement therapy for 90 % of new ESRD patients, involves pumping a patient's blood through an external <b>dialysis</b> machine to <b>filter</b> and clean the blood before returning it to the body. This process requires a vascular access be placed in the patient to allow the blood to flow from the patient to the dialysis machine and back again. There are two main types of vascular access: a temporary catheter, which is simply a plastic tube inserted through the skin and into a vein, and an internal access, which connects an artery and vein together to produce a strong location from which blood can be drawn. The internal access is called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) if the vein and artery are joined directly together. If they are joined with a synthetic tube it is called an arteriovenous graft (AVG). Catheters are quick to insert, cost very little and can be used almost immediately. However, they are prone to infections and complications like clotting. AVFs and AVGs, on the other hand, are surgically created, causing them to be more expensive and require time to mature before they can be used. However, since they are completely internal they are much less at risk for infections and complications. For those who are good candidates for an AVF, the timing of their AVF placement in relation to dialysis initiation can be classified into three distinct groups: (i) those who have had an AVF placed early enough so that it is mature and ready for use when it is time to begin chronic dialysis; (ii) those who have had an AVF placed prior to dialysis initiation that has not had enough time to mature, forcing them to begin dialysis using temporary catheters until the AVF is ready; and (iii) those who do not have an AVF placed until after they have already begun regular dialysis, resulting in the full maturation time occurring while they dialyze with catheters. The main research question I wish to address is: Does having a mature AVF at the start of dialysis result in a net cost-savings to Medicare compared to either: having an AVF in place but not yet mature at initiation, or having an AVF placed soon after the start of dialysis? Currently, Medicare makes a few exceptions regarding coverage of ESRD patients for those not already Medicare eligible. While Medicare does not have any exceptions involving AVF placement prior to dialysis, if doing do would actually result in lower overall costs it might benefit Medicare to make such an exception...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades an ongoing {{discussion}} about the necessary dose of dialysis brought the result that the urea based Kt/V value is significantly correlated to morbidity of the end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Even if it is not completely accepted, it seems to be more and more agreement of the nephrological community that for good dialysis practice Kt/V should be kept above 1. 2 to 1. 3 in the usual 3 X 4 hours per week dialysis schedule for patients without own residual clearance to assure long term quality of life, low morbidity and mortality. K is the clearance of urea the dialysis system can apply, t is the treatment time and V is the urea distribution volume of the patient, which is nearly equal to total body water. Kt/V has the unit of a drug dose (ml of drug per ml of patient volume) and therefore sometimes is called dialysis 'dose', even if this is subject of discussion because it implies that the dose can be described with only one urea related number. This work does not participate in this discussion. The premise of this work is more technical: Whatever the final result of the above discussion will be, a patient-friendly, precise cost-neutral and handy technical solution should be given to the hand of the interested nephrologist to continuously supervise the urea based Kt/V that is applied to the patient. Of course this is combined with the hope that the long term mortality can be decreased if a covering online dialysis success control is facilitated. The technical solution that has been chosen is based on the equivalence of the diffusion coefficients of sodium chloride and urea. It is central subject of the investigation if the diffusive behaviour of sodium is equal to that of urea crossing the <b>dialysis</b> <b>filter</b> membrane. The advantage that makes the principle so handy is that sodium can be measured very precise by standard conductivity cells as they are implemented in dialysis machines in large numbers. The only necessary hardware modification is a second conductivity cell downstream the dialyser to be able to measure the mass balance over the filter. This is more complicated with urea that can only be measured undergoing an enzymatic conversion to ammonium ions. The ammonium ions induce a membrane potential, which is measured with very sensitive amplifiers. A cooling chain for the enzyme must be maintained. To find and approve the conductivity based technical solution two in-vivo studies have been conducted. In the first study a conductivity step profile, varying the conductivity in static levels in a baseline - 7 min high - 7 min low- baseline shape, was applied that can be utilised to measure the urea clearance very accurate. This principle has been described in 1982 in a patent application. In a sequence of 206 computer recorded dialysis sessions with 22 patients it was found that urea clearance could be electrolytically measured with a mean error+/-standard deviation of - 1. 46 +/- 4. 75 %, n= 494. The measurement of Kt/V according to a single pool model was of similar accuracy: 2. 88 +/- 4. 15 %. Although in accordance with other studies these findings at an average confirmed the high correlation of ionic and urea based clearance measurements, an effect was found that was not consistent with the theory that was existent so far. It was found in the first study that the accuracy of the step profile measurements were dependent {{of the size of the}} patient, in particular of the urea distribution volume. Moreover it was of relevance which part of the step profile was used: the high-low states, the baseline- low or the baseline-high states. This was a theoretical lack. Careful analysis led to the result that sodium transfer from and into the patient was the reason for the dependence. This led to the enhancement of the theory that seems to correctly describe the nature of the effect. A new demand now was to minimise the sodium transfer. This was limited using static step profiles because in the time it needs to become stable sodium is shifted. In consequence non-stable, dynamic short conductivity boli were developed that allowed to minimise the amount of sodium to be shifted to the limits of the technical resolution of the measurement systems. Also the associated mathematical tools to evaluate the boli had to be suited to the problem. After termination of this process a second study was conducted to approve the new method found. In this study with 10 patients and 93 sessions, 264 step profile measurements and 173 bolus ionic dialysance measurements it was found that the bolus measurements matched their related blood side urea clearance references with the outstanding accuracy of (error+/-SD) 0. 06 +/- 4. 76 %. The result was not significantly different (p= 0. 87) from the reference by student's t-test for paired data. The Kt/V reference according to the single pool variable volume urea kinetic model (sPVVUKM) was found to be matched by the bolus principle with 5. 32 +/- 3. 9 % accuracy and a correlation of 0. 98. The remaining difference of 5. 32 % can be attributed to the neglect of the urea generation rate. Also the step profile was found to be very precise here. The error versus sPVVUKM was 0. 05 %+/- 5 %, r= 0. 96. However it did not image the neglect of urea generation correctly. Also a two pool modelling that comprises an internal compartimentation of the fluid pools of the patient was applied to the continuously recorded data. This two pool urea kinetic model (2 PUKM) is regarded to be a more precise theoretical approach and now includes the urea generation. It found the bolus principle to deviate - 3. 04 +/- 14. 3 %, n. s., p= 0. 13. The high standard deviation is due to the complexity of the model. Further from the developed theory a simplified method to roughly measure the sodium distribution volume could be derived. This method was tested in-vitro versus a container with dialysate of known volume and in-vivo versus the urea distribution volume. The in-vitro results were - 19. 9 +/- 34 %, r= 0. 92, n. s, p= 0. 916. In-vivo they were found to be - 7. 4 +/- 23. 2 %, r= 0. 71, n. s., p= 0. 39. Due to dilution theory the sodium and urea distribution volumes virtually appear to be very similar using this method, although they absolutely differ significantly. Facing the strong simplifications that were made before applying this theory these results seem to be very encouraging that it could be possible to develop a principle to measure not only K but also V electrolytically. This would allow a true Kt/V measurement. The empirical urea distribution volume measurement using anthropometrical formulas has been compared to analytical methods. It has been found that the use Watson's formula with a - 13 % correction gives good results. The correction should be applied with great care because it increases Kt/V just on a arithmetical base to the disadvantage of the patient. Also electrolytical plasma sodium measurement was evaluated and can be measured using a mixed analytic-empirical formula with an accuracy of 4. 3 +/- 1. 2 %. In summary, conductivity based methods seem to be a convenient method to measure several dialysis parameters of some clinical interest without effort. The results of this work meanwhile are implemented with substantial numbers into commonly available dialysis machines and the experience of the first time shows that the principle is well accepted by the clinicians. Eine die letzten beiden Jahrzehnte anhaltende Diskussion über die erforderliche Dosis Dialyse, die ein Patient benötigt, ergab, daß der Harnstoff-basierte Kt/V-Wert signifikant mit der Morbidität von ‚end stage renal deasease' (ESRD) - Patienten korreliert. Wenn auch nicht vollständig akzeptiert, so scheint es doch zunehmende Übereinkunft zwischen Nephrologen, daß eine angemessene Dialysebehandlung von Patienten ohne Restdiurese im Rahmen eines 3 x 4 Stunden pro Woche- Schemas mindestens einen Kt/V-Wert von 1. 2 bis 1. 3 ergeben sollte, um auf lange Sicht die Lebensqualität zu sichern und die Morbidität und Mortalität niedrig zu halten. K ist die vom Dialysesystem erbrachte Clearance, t die Behandlungszeit und V das Harnstoff-Verteilungsvolumen, welches dem Gesamt-Körperwasser nahezu gleicht. Kt/V wird in der Dosiseinheit (ml Medikament pro ml Körperwasser) ausgedrückt und daher auch häufig als Dialyse-‚Dosis' bezeichnet, auch wenn darüber wegen der Zusammenfassung in nur einer Harnstoff-korrelierten Zahl konträr diskutiert wird. Diese Arbeit besitzt eine eher technische Prämisse und möchte sich nicht an dieser Diskussion beteiligen. Sie möchte dem interessierten Nephrologen lediglich eine patientenfreundliche, präzise, kostenneutrale und leicht zu handhabende technische Lösung an die Hand geben, um kontinuierlich die in Kt/V ausgedrückte Dialysedosis zu überwachen. Natürlich ist damit auch die Hoffnung verbunden, daß die Langzeit-Sterblichkeit verringert werden kann, wenn eine flächendeckende, zeitnahe Erfolgskontrolle der Dialyse ermöglicht wird. Die gewählte technische Lösung basiert auf der Äquivalenz der Diffusionskoeffizienten von gelöstem Harnstoff und Natriumchlorid. Es ist das zentrale Anliegen dieser Studie, festzustellen, ob das Diffusionsverhalten von NaCl und Harnstoff beim Durchtritt durch die Membran des Dialysefilters gleich ist. Der entscheidende Vorteil, der das Verfahren so leicht handhabbar macht, besteht darin, daß NaCl-Konzentrationen sehr genau durch die ohnehin in großer Zahl in Dialysegeräten verwendeten Leitfähigkeitsmeßzellen bestimmt werden können. Um die NaCl-Massenbilanz über den Dialysefilter zu bestimmen, benötigt man lediglich eine weitere Meßzelle, die stromab des Filters zu installieren ist. Die Messung von Harnstoff, die indirekt über die enzymatische Zerlegung in Ammonium-Ionen und das anschließende Erzeugen eines hoch zu verstärkenden elektrischen Potentials an einer Membran geschieht, ist komplizierter. Zudem ist eine geschlossene Kühlkette für das Enzym sicher zu|$|R
