25|$|Thus, in {{statements}} made by Swedish politicians, the Swedish sentiments against the Russian government have always been about fear of military invasion, which now seemed to be gone for the foreseeable future, and also about human rights and democracy issues.

25|$|The 56th was one {{of three}} P-47 groups in England, and the only one to {{previously}} train on the Thunderbolt. The 4th Fighter Group at RAF Debden had been created the preceding September by incorporating the veteran RAF Eagle squadrons into the USAAF, and the newly arrived 78th Fighter Group at RAF Goxhill had previously flown P-38 Lightnings. Consequently, the 56th was the only group of the three to <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> their aircraft despite problems of compressibility in dives, and performance teething problems that included poor rate of climb, poor acceleration, numerous engine seizures to oil counterbalance seal failures, ignition system problems, radio interference, and lack of spare parts.|$|E

25|$|Paulson {{agreed with}} Bernanke {{that the only}} way to unlock the frozen capital markets was to provide direct {{injections}} into financial institutions so investors would <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> these institutions. The government would take a non-voting share position, with 5% dividends for the first year on the money lent to the banks and 9% thereafter until the banks stabilized and could repay the government loans. According to the book Too Big To Fail, Paulson, Bernanke, New York Federal Reserve Chairman Timothy Geithner, and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair attended the meeting on October 13, 2008, at which this plan was presented to the CEOs of nine major banks.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons {{have been}} speculated {{as to why}} older adults use less {{effective}} encoding and retrieval strategies as they age. The first is the “disuse” view, which states that memory strategies are used less by older adults as they move further away from the educational system. Second is the “diminished attentional capacity” hypothesis, which means that older people engage less in self-initiated encoding due to reduced attentional capacity. The third reason is the “memory self-efficacy,” which indicates that older people do not <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> their own memory performances, leading to poor consequences. It is known that patients with Alzheimer’s disease and patients with semantic dementia both exhibit difficulty in tasks that involve picture naming and category fluency. This is tied to damage to their semantic network, which stores knowledge of meanings and understandings.|$|E

[...] Beasley also revealed the city council was to write a report on tackling election fraud, after the Electoral Commission said it could be adopted as best practice. As part of the drive to reduce election fraud, the council sent out blank registration forms, resulting in more than 8,000 people falling off the electoral roll.|$|E

500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tho was also {{becoming}} unpopular {{in the military}} establishment. One {{of the goals of}} the coup plots at the time was to remove Tho and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target—at the time, the MRC was moving towards removing Tho, and Minh was the only senior general to still <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him. A more important reason for the incumbent generals' lack of preparedness for Khánh's coup was their misunderstanding of the US stance. After what had happened to Diệm, as well as other failed coup attempts, they regarded American backing as the decisive factor for the survival of any government and the success of any coup. As a result, repeated assurances from Lodge and Johnson's laudatory comments in private and public convinced them that they remained on firm ground. Johnson had told Lodge to assure Minh in a meeting on January 1, 1964, that he had [...] "the complete support of the United States as the leader of Vietnam [...] ".|$|E

This number had {{increased}} to 18,919 {{by the beginning}} of 1943. Initial reactions to the Northover Projector were varied, with a number of Home Guard volunteers uncertain about the weapon's unusual design, and some officers never accepted that it could be useful. However, most Home Guard units came to accept the weapon and <b>have</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> it, aided by large amounts of what Mackenzie terms [...] "War Office propaganda" [...] which cited the positive qualities of the weapon, such as its simplicity of use, ease of manufacture and low maintenance requirements. It was, as one Home Guard volunteer put it, [...] "something to be accepted gratefully until something better arrived." [...] Like many of the obsolete weapons designed for the Home Guard, the Northover Projector was only taken out of service when it could be replaced with [...] "marginally less ineffective" [...] weapons provided by the Army, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
