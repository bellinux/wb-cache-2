40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) causes leukaemia {{or chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease in ∼ 5 % of infected hosts. The level of proviral expression of HTLV- 1 differs significantly among infected people, {{even at the}} same proviral load (proportion of infected mononuclear cells in the circulation). A high level of expression of the HTLV- 1 provirus {{is associated with a}} high proviral load and a high risk of the inflammatory disease of the central nervous system known as HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). But the factors that control the rate of HTLV- 1 proviral expression remain unknown. Here we show that proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> of HTLV- 1 in vivo are not randomly distributed within the human genome but are associated with transcriptionally active regions. Comparison of proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> between individuals with high and low levels of proviral expression, and between provirus-expressing and provirus non-expressing cells from within an individual, demonstrated that frequent integration into transcription units was associated with an increased rate of proviral expression. An increased frequency of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in transcription units in individuals with high proviral expression was also associated with the inflammatory disease HAM/TSP. By comparing the distribution of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in human lymphocytes infected in short-term cell culture with those from persistent infection in vivo, we infer the action of two selective forces that shape the distribution of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in vivo: positive selection for cells containing proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in transcriptionally active regions of the genome, and negative selection against cells with proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> within transcription units...|$|R
40|$|A {{high level}} of {{provirus}} expression and a high proviral load during persistent Human T Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV- 1) infection are {{associated with an increased}} risk of the inflammatory disease HTLV- 1 associated myelopathy (HAMITSP). However, the factors that control HTLV- 1 proviral expression and proviral load in vivo are not known. In this study, we investigate the. influences of epigenetics and the distribution of proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> on the control of these factors. Using inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) and methyl-transferases (MTi), we determined that acetylation controls proviral expression in vivo but epigenetic differences between individuals do not cause proviral load and disease-risk variation. Ã‚Â• By analysing proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> derived from individuals persistently infected with HTLV- 1, we identified that the distribution' of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> is associated with the probability of provirus expression and thG risk of HAMITSP. As an independent verification of this observation, analysis of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> found in provirus-expressing and provirus-non-expre~sing infected cells wit~in an individual found that provirus expression is associated with integration into genes. By comparing the distribution of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> from HTLV- 1 -infected individuals with a set of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> derived from a co-culture system in vitro, we infer that the distribution of <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in persistent infection is subject to in vivo selection. We identified positive selection for cells containing proviral integrations within transcriptionally active regions of the genome but negative selection against cells containing proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in transcription units (Le. genes) in vivo. An investigation into alternative markers of transcriptional activity identified a previously uncharacterised transcriptionally active region of the HTLV- 1 genome. Preliminary identification and characterization of a novel non-coding anti-sense transcript (AST 2) was carried out. In summary, we have demonstrated that the cellular epigenetic status and the distribution of proviral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> are associated with provirus ex'pression in vivo. The interplay of these factors with previously defined parameters, such as the efficiency of the CTL response, determines an individual's provirus expression, proviral load and consequent disease risk during persistent infection by HTLV- 1.

We developed a novel high throughput sequencing method to evaluate HIV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in latently infected cell lines to determine whether there was virus replication or clonal expansion in these cell lines observed as multiple integration events at the same position. Results We modified a previously reported method using random DNA shearing and PCR to allow for high throughput robotic processing to identify the site and frequency of HIV integration in latently infected cell lines. Latently infected cell lines infected with intact virus demonstrated multiple distinct HIV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> (28 different sites in U 1, 110 in ACH- 2 and 117 in J 1. 1 per 150, 000 cells). In contrast, cell lines infected with replication-incompetent viruses (J-Lat cells) demonstrated single <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> Following in vitro passaging of the ACH- 2 cell line, we observed {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of unique HIV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> and there were multiple mutations and large deletions in the proviral DNA. When the ACH- 2 cell line was cultured with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir, there was a significant decrease in the number of unique HIV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> and a transient increase in the frequency of 2 -LTR circles consistent with virus replication in these cells. Conclusion Cell lines latently infected with intact HIV demonstrated multiple unique HIV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> indicating that these cell lines are not clonal and in the ACH- 2 cell line there was evidence of low level virus replication.

40|$|International audienceRetroviral integrases (INs) {{catalyse}} {{the integration}} of the reverse transcribed viral DNA into the host cell genome. This process is selective, and chromatin has been proposed to be a major factor regulating this step in the viral life cycle. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are still under investigation. We have developed a new in vitro integration assay using physiologically-relevant, reconstituted genomic acceptor chromatin and high-throughput determination of nucleosome positions and <b>integration</b> <b>sites,</b> in parallel. A quantitative analysis of the resulting data reveals a chromatin-dependent redistribution of the <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> and establishes a link between <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> and nucleosome positions. The co-activator LEDGF/ p 75 enhanced integration but did not modify the <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> under these conditions. We also conducted an in cellulo genome-wide comparative study of nucleosome positions and human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> identified experimentally in vivo. These studies confirm a preferential integration in nucleosome-covered regions. Using a DNA mechanical energy model, we show that the physical properties of DNA probed by IN binding are important in determining IN selectivity. These novel in vitro and in vivo approaches confirm that IN has a preference for integration into a nucleosome, and suggest the existence of two levels of IN selectivity. The first depends on the physical properties of the target DNA and notably, the energy required to fit DNA into the IN catalytic pocket. The second depends on the DNA deformation associated with DNA wrapping around a nucleosome. Taken together, these results indicate that HIV- 1 IN is a shape-readout DNA binding protein...|$|R
