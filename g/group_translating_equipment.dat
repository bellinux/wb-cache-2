40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{comparison}} between the effects of translation, back translation, and cloze task used for the learning and retention of technical medical terms in an ESP class. These tasks were selected to comply with Depth of Processing Hypothesis based on which the more cognitively one is engaged in learning a word, {{the more likely it}} is to remember it later. Investigating learners’ motivation for learning technical vocabulary by these techniques was another concern of this study. In this regard 42 medical female undergraduates attending an ESP class at Islamic Azad University of Najafabad took part in the experiment. They were randomly divided into three groups. The first group filled in the blanks of two English medical texts with technical vocabulary (Cloze task) in two sessions. The second <b>group</b> <b>translated</b> the same medical texts into Persian and the third <b>group</b> <b>translated</b> the same texts from Persian into English (Back translation). All groups took the immediate and delayed posttests. The results showed that the cloze task group(CTG) outperformed the others. In fact, cloze task was found more effective than the other two tasks for technical vocabulary learning, as it required a deeper level of processing...|$|R
