Maintenance of the register is specified in clause 44, and clause 45 specifies that [...] "an <b>electronic</b> <b>copy</b> of the Register for each electoral district shall {{be sent to the}} MP for the constituency" [...] by 15 October of each year Clause 55 permits the chief electoral officer of Elections Canada to [...] "enter into agreements with provincial bodies responsible for establishing voters’ lists" [...] and that a payment may be issued to the provincial body. Prohibition of unauthorised use of the National Register of Electors is stipulated in clause 56, which also prohibits electors from providing false information.|$|E

2500|$|On January 24, 2017, Aleynikov's {{conviction}} was reinstated by the First Department of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. [...] The {{appellate court}} found the trial court's reasoning—that an <b>electronic</b> <b>copy</b> {{of the code}} was not a [...] "tangible" [...] reproduction—made [...] "little sense," [...] as a compact disc and a thumb drive are both [...] "unquestionably tangible." [...] The appellate court {{also found that the}} trial court erred in concluding that Aleynikov lacked [...] "intent to appropriate," [...] holding that the evidence [...] "permits a rational inference that defendant intended to exercise permanent control over the use of Goldman's source code, as opposed to a short-term borrowing." [...] Aleynikov's lawyer has stated that he will seek [...] "immediate leave to appeal" [...] the decision.|$|E
2500|$|Like other writing systems {{derived from}} the Arabic script, Urdu uses the 0600–06FF Unicode range. Certain glyphs in this range appear {{visually}} similar (or identical when presented using particular fonts) even though the underlying encoding is different. This presents problems for information storage and retrieval. For example, the University of Chicago's <b>electronic</b> <b>copy</b> of John Shakespear's [...] "A Dictionary, Hindustani, and English" [...] includes the word '' (India). Searching for the string [...] "" [...] returns no results, whereas querying with the (identical-looking in many fonts) string [...] "" [...] returns the correct entry. This is because the medial form of the Urdu letter do chashmi he (U+06BE)—used to form aspirate digraphs in Urdu—is visually identical in its medial form to the Arabic letter hāʾ (U+0647; phonetic value [...] ). In Urdu, the [...] phoneme {{is represented by the}} character U+06C1, called gol he (round he), or chhoti he (small he).|$|E
2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an <b>electronic</b> <b>copy</b> as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E
