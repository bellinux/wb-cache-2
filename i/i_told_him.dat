5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me that nothing could be worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E
25|$|Anquetil's {{head was}} a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what {{happened}} when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed {{on the front of}} my car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.|$|E
60|$|I gave 'im the tanner. It {{was no use}} {{standing}} there arguing over a tanner, with a purse of twelve quid waiting {{for me in the}} dock, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> wot people thought of 'im.|$|R

25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it was a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and}} so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E

500|$|However, {{according}} to the song's other co-writer Fraser T Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Break Your Heart" [...] was rejected by Cole's Polydor label boss Ferdy Unger-Hamilton felt it was too similar to [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] by will.i.am, the executive producer of 3 Words. Smith also told This Must Be Pop: [...] "Taio felt the lyric was a bit cocky for him to carry off – <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he sounded great on it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Moran and California Republican Duke Cunningham {{had to be}} {{restrained}} by the Capitol Police after a shoving match {{on the house floor}} over President Bill Clinton's decision to send U.S. troops to Bosnia. [...] "I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so," [...] Moran recalled. [...] "He said he didn't mean to be so accusatory ... After that, he would bring me candy from California." [...] Moran said that after the encounter he found Cunningham crying in the cloakroom.|$|E

500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E
500|$|During {{the snake}} {{handling}} {{scene at the}} Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called [...] "May Glory Protect Us". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I could write one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it.
