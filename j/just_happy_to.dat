25|$|After {{travelling}} to Malaysia for {{the second}} round of the season, Alonso was passed fit to take part in the event after undergoing medical tests at the track. In the season opener, his Ferrari replacement Sebastian Vettel had finished on the podium, whilst McLaren occupied the last row with huge difficulties with the performance of the car and the new engine package.
