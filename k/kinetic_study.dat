In the present study, it was revealed that there is a strong positive correlation between inter-electrode space, and TD, COD as well as BOD abatement rates and rate of coefficients. The pseudo-first-order abatement kinetic was relatively fitted. The decrease in the distance between electrodes from 10.0 to 2.5  cm increased the rate constant from 0.01 to 0.026  min− 1 for TD, 0.007 to 0.020  min− 1 for COD and 0.006 to 0.018  min− 1 for BOD using Al–Fe electrode combination and from 0.008 to 0.019  min− 1 for TD, 0.006 to 0.015  min− 1 for COD and 0.005 to 0.014  min− 1 for BOD using Fe–Al electrode combination.
