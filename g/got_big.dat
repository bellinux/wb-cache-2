2500|$|As a senior, Dierdorf started {{nine games}} at right tackle {{and one at}} left tackle for the 1970 Michigan team that {{compiled}} a 9–1 record. At an October 1973 press luncheon, coach Schembechler opined that Dierdorf was [...] "as good as any tackle in the country" [...] with [...] "good quickness, wonderful strength, smartness, and competitiveness, and he's a great leader." [...] Asking if Dierdorf had any faults, Schembechler paused, then answered his own question: [...] "Faults? Hummmm. He's <b>got</b> <b>big</b> feet and it's hard to fit him into shoes. That's all I can think of." [...] Dierdorf was a consensus first-team pick on the 1970 College Football All-America Team, receiving first-team honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the AP, the Football Writers Association of America, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and the UPI. He was also picked by both the AP and UPI as a first-team All-Big Ten player, and was picked to play in three post-season all-star games: the East–West Shrine Game, Hula Bowl, and College All-Star Game.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and now I have to go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm still young and I've <b>got</b> <b>big</b> things to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Patriot {{received}} mildly favorable {{reviews from}} critics. The film scored a [...] "Fresh" [...] rating of 61% rating among all critics on Rotten Tomatoes, which notes that it [...] "can be entertaining to watch, but it relies {{too much on}} formula and melodrama." [...] The Patriot {{is one of two}} Emmerich films to ever be given a [...] "fresh" [...] rating from that website (the other is Independence Day). Rotten Tomatoes also notes that, [...] "While his hero is conscience-stricken about killing, Emmerich sure enjoys serving it up in generous helpings. [...] " [...] On Metacritic, the film earned a rating of 63 out of 100, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell gave the film a generally negative review, although he praised its casting and called Mel Gibson [...] "an astonishing actor", particularly for his [...] "on-screen comfort and expansiveness". He said the film is a [...] "gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality". Jamie Malanowski, also writing in The New York Times, said The Patriot [...] "will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer evening. It's <b>got</b> <b>big</b> battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally guilt-free villain, thrills, tenderness, sorrow, rage {{and a little bit of}} kissing". The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Sound.|$|E

60|$|There we had {{the whole}} story. His enterprising neighbors had invaded the {{domestic}} hearth, shot his mother, and eaten her up, made her skin into chamois leather, and were keeping him till he <b>got</b> <b>big</b> enough for the same disposition, using his talents meanwhile to turn a penny upon; yet not a word of all this thought he; not a bit the less heartily did he caper; never speculated a minute on why it was, {{on the origin of}} evil, or any thing of the sort; or, if he did, at least never said a word about it. I gave one good look into his soft, round, glassy eyes, and could see nothing there but the most tranquil contentment.

6000|$|... "They aren't {{arranged}} better now. Grip that! Now, it's {{a sort of}} paradox. If you've <b>got</b> <b>big</b> {{gifts and}} you choose to help forward the world, {{if you choose to}} tell all you know and give away everything you can do in the way of work, you've got to give up the ideas of wealth and security, and that means fine women and children. You've got to be a deprived sort of man. 'All right,' you say, 'That's me!' But how about your wife being a deprived sort of woman? Eh? That's where it gets you! And meanwhile, you know, while you make your sacrifices and do your researches, there'll be little mean sharp active beasts making money all over you like maggots on a cheese. And if everybody who'd got gifts and altruistic ideas gave themselves up to it, then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the glory. They'd get everything. Every blessed thing. There wouldn't be an option they didn't hold. And the other chaps would produce the art and the science and the literature, as far as the men who'd got hold of things would let 'em, and perish out of the earth altogether.... There you are! Still, that's how things are made...." ...|$|E
60|$|Then came {{a period}} when one was going about {{receiving}} and giving congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the nurseries. All the children of one's friends had <b>got</b> <b>big</b> maps of England cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were busy sticking gummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto submerged the country. And there were also orange labels, if I remember rightly, to represent the new Labour party, and green for the Irish. I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as {{the results of the}} counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up {{at one end of the}} large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} it is," [...] the porter said as they sat {{together}} afterwards, [...] "but a gentleman looks like a gentleman put him in what clothes you will. I could have sworn to your being that if I'd never seen you before. I can't make it out, I don't know what it is, but there's certainly something in gentle blood, whatever you may say about it. Some of my mates are forever saying that one man's as good as another. Now I don't mean to say they ain't as good; but what I say is, as they ain't the same. One man ain't the same as another {{any more than a}} race horse is the same as a cart horse. They both sprang from the same stock, at least so they says; but breeding and feeding and care has made one into a slim boned creature as can run like the wind, while the other has <b>got</b> <b>big</b> bones and weight and can drag his two ton after him without turning a hair. Now, I take it, it's the same thing with gentlefolks and working men. It isn't that one's bigger than the other, for I don't see much difference that way; but a gentleman's lighter in the bone, and his hands and his feet are smaller, and he carries himself altogether different. His voice gets a different tone. Why, Lord bless you, when I hears two men coming along the platform at night, even when I can't see 'em, and can't hear what they says, only the tone of their voices, I knows just as well whether it's a first class or a third door as I've got to open as if I saw 'em in the daylight. Rum, ain't it?" ...|$|E
