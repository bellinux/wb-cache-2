Professional skateboarer Josh Nelson is the {{inventor}} of this <b>grind</b> <b>back</b> in 1986 at the Del Mar skate ranch in Del Mar, California. The name feeble grind came from Josh Nelson's friend and fellow skateboarder Sean Donnelley. Sean used to call Josh [...] "the feeb" [...] which was short for feeble, because Nelson was so skinny and often had broken limbs and injuries from skateboarding. Many people watched Josh create this unique type of grind on the parking blocks that were mounted in the reservoir at the Del Mar Skate Ranch.|$|E
50|$|The twist is {{performed}} by {{standing with the}} feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. The arms are held out from the body, bent at the elbow.

The feet <b>grind</b> <b>back</b> and forth on the floor, and the dance can be varied in speed, intensity, and vertical height as necessary. Occasionally one leg is lifted off the floor for styling, but generally the dance posture is low and with the feet in contact with the floor with very little vertical motion.The moves include the mashed potato, swimming, drowning, twisting, arm swing and single leg twist.|$|E

50|$|The {{situation}} was salvaged {{only by a}} one Pyotr Rumyantsev, later to become Catherine the Great's foremost general; he rallied the Russian forces in the center, driving the Prussians back and ending {{the threat of a}} decisive breakthrough and defeat. With the Russian columns, particularly the artillery, now <b>grinding</b> <b>back</b> at their attackers, the Prussians were forced to retreat from battle. Losses had been roughly even, but the small Prussian force could ill afford its casualties. Apraksin, horrified by the losses, lacked the stomach to make good on his victory, and retreated to winter quarters, making the battle one of the most casual victories in Russian history. He was later relieved of command and put on trial for his heinous lack of initiative, dying in prison the next year.|$|R

40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>back</b> dead leaf bases on {{the stems}} of {{arborescent}} grasstrees (Xant 7 wrrlwea spp.) reveals {{a pattern of}} horizontal bands that has been interpreted as {{a record of the}} fire history experienced by the plant. The validity of this fire history record has previously been assessed through comparison of 100 grasstree stems sampled from shrubland near Eneabba in Western Australia against a 30 year fire history determined from satellite imagery. This analysis showed that the two records matched more than would be expected by chance, but concluded that the interpretation of the grasstree record as a fire history was not warranted as most of the grasstree fire records did not match satellite fire records. A second analysis of the same two sets of records, published in this journal, also showed that the records matched more than by chance, but concluded that the interpretation of grasstree banding as fire history was valid, though it failed to quantify the strength of this agreement. Here we examine' the approaches and interpretations of the two previously published studies, and provide new analyses to refine estimates of the amount of fire-related data present in the grasstree record. We show that only ~ 20 % of grasstree 'fire' records may be attributable to fire. With eight out of ten of records not attributable to fire, we confirm that the grasstree record in its current form cannot be interpreted as fire history, and therefore claims of the grasstree technique to support management actions are untenable...|$|R

5000|$|Freezer milling {{is a type}} of {{cryogenic}} milling {{that uses}} a solenoid to mill samples. The solenoid moves the <b>grinding</b> media <b>back</b> and forth inside the vial, grinding the sample down to analytical fineness. This type of milling is especially useful in milling temperature sensitive samples, as samples are milled at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The idea behind using a solenoid is that the only [...] "moving part" [...] in the system is the grinding media inside the vial. The {{reason for this is that}} at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196°C) any moving part will come under huge stress leading to potentially poor reliability. Cryogenic milling using a solenoid has been used for over 50 years and has been proved to be a very reliable method of processing temperature sensitive samples in the laboratory.|$|R

40|$|A {{chemical}} mechanical grinding (CMG) wheel {{was developed}} for planarization of silicon wafers, which consists of magnesium oxide (MgO) abrasives and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) additives, mixed with 25 % weight percentage of magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) solution. It was shown that chemical reactions occurred during the grinding process, which formed a softened layer {{on the top of}} silicon substrate. The reactants could be much more easily removed by mechanical abrasion than the removal of Si phase itself. The newly developed wheel was able to produce a similar surface integrity to that obtained from chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), i. e., the CMG achieved a surface roughness of 0. 5 nm in R (a) and a subsurface damage layer of 13 nm thick.

A SOMI substrate, consisting of a 300 nm thick top-Si, a buried thin CoSi 2 layer, a buried SiO 2 layer on a silicon substrate, was formed using an SOI substrate as the starting material.

As the enamel is worn away and the dentin is exposed, the ring structure of the tooth is visible. There is the outer casing of enamel, then the dentine, then the inner ring of enamel that is the edge of the infundibulum, and then the cementum center which is darker. The rings first appear when the horse's tooth has been worn level at about age 6 to 8.

It is very hard, measuring between 65 and 69 HRC (also based on the base metal's hardness).

[...] Increasing plating thickness amplifies surface defects and roughness in proportional severity, because hard chrome does not have a leveling effect.
