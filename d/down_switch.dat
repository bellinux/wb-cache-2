50|$|One of {{the most}} common inputs into a TCU is the kick <b>down</b> <b>switch</b> which is used to {{determine}} if the accelerator pedal has been depressed past full throttle. When activated the transmission downshifts into the lowest permissible gear based on current road speed to use the full power reserves of the engine. This is still present in most transmissions though is no longer as necessary to use as the TCU uses the throttle position sensor and rapid rate of change to determine whether a downshift may be necessary, thus {{there is no need to}} use the kickdown feature in most circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|Left-hand {{modulation}} {{from the}} keyboard is unusual. The polyphonic portamento or glide feature {{can be used}} very effectively with {{in conjunction with the}} arpeggiator and any preset. An octave <b>down</b> <b>switch</b> by the modulation wheel is also available independent of memorized settings. Unlike Moog or Sequential, the Roland modulation wheel goes left to right, and is spring-loaded. A short spike on top of the spring-loaded modulation wheel allows for an unusual rapid fanning, but risks damage to this out of production part. Knobs allow depth of pitch bend or LFO modulation, in addition to the amounts assigned and memorized. Toggle switches select bend or LFO to the wheel and onto any combination of VCO/VCF/VCA in an unusual selection pattern, all controlled by a single wheel motion.|$|E
30|$|Operational level: Operating {{the vehicle}} in an {{appropriate}} manner helps {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and component wear. The engine efficiency can be increased by accelerating at high engine torque. Unnecessary downshifts, e.g. by triggering the kick <b>down</b> <b>switch,</b> should be avoided. Switching off the engine reduces fuel consumption during long idling phases. Brake wear is reduced by applying wear-free braking systems, such as retarder or exhaust brake.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} and virtualization are {{enabling technologies}} for designing energy-aware resource management mechanisms in virtualized data centers. Indeed, {{one of the}} main challenges of big data centers is to decrease the power consumption, both to cut costs and to reduce the environmental impact. To this extent, Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation is often used to smartly reallocate the VMs with the objective of reducing the power consumption, by exploiting the VM live migration. The consolidation problem consists in finding the set of migrations that allow to keep turned on the minimum number of servers needed to host all the VMs. However, most of the proposed consolidation approaches do not consider the network related consumption, which represents about 10 – 20 % of the total energy consumed by IT equipment in real data centers. This paper proposes a novel joint server and network consolidation model that takes into account the power efficiency of both the switches forwarding the traffic and the servers hosting the VMs. It powers <b>down</b> <b>switch</b> ports and routes traffic along the most energy efficient path towards the least energy consuming server under QoS constraints. Since the model is complex, a fast Simulated Annealing based Resource Consolidation algorithm (SARC) is proposed. Our numerical results demonstrate that our approach is able to save on average 50 % of the network related power consumption compared to a network unaware consolidation...|$|E

40|$|If IP {{networks}} are embedded over the facility networks such as ATM or DWDM, link addition or removal is easily accomplished {{by setting up}} or tearing <b>down</b> <b>switched</b> virtual circuits. Exploiting the flexibility of this light-overhead reconfiguration, we propose a dynamic topology reconfiguration scheme to improve network utilization {{and the quality of}} services. The proposed dynamic topology reconfiguration scheme alleviates transient surge of traffic or congestion by temporarily adding IP links to the underlying IP network topology (built based on long-term traffic predictions). Identifying locations for additional IP links and deciding the amount of bandwidth to allocate to such additional IP links is a NP-hard optimization problem, and thus, in our research, Genetic Algorithm is adopted, a widely accepted technique for searching near-optimal solutions in a large search space. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme effectively alleviates the transient congestion and that the computation overhead is moderate such that the proposed technique is applicable to short/mid term traffic fluctuations. Key words: topology reconfiguration, dynamic reconfiguration...|$|R

It combines an error amplifier with reference current sources to achieve good current matching characteristics and lower phase noises. Charge sharing can be eliminated by using charge removal transistors. In addition, a lowvoltage cascode current mirror and gain-boosting circuit are used to enhance current matching over process corners and increase the output impedance of the CP. Good current matching characteristic is achieved with less than 0. 1 % difference of the Up/Down current and 1 % over all process variations.

40|$|Lattice QCD {{can be used}} {{to study}} the QCD phase diagram at finite {{temperature}} and zero density. Non-zero density is implemented on the lattice using the chemical potential however this gives a possibility of a complex probability which means the statistical machinery normally used breaks <b>down.</b> <b>Switching</b> the gauge group from three colour to two colour avoids this problem. Simulating two colour QCD allows for investigation into the thermodynamic phase transitions of a theory which is similar to three colour QCD. Confinement and asymptotic freedom are observed, however the definitions for hadrons differ. To study the thermodynamics we use the derivative method which requires the determination of the Karsch coefficients. Previous studies determined these coefficients perturbatively however this led to negative values for pressure. Non-perturbative studies have proved difficult due to the computational cost and accuracy required. We attempt to determine these coefficients non-perturbatively and review possible improvements in setup and calculation. We finish with thermodynamic results for the pressure, energy density and trace anomaly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a step <b>down,</b> <b>switched</b> mode power converter {{for use in}} multi-standard envelope tracking radio frequency power amplifiers (RFPA). The converter {{is based on a}} programmable order sigma delta modulator that can be configured to operate with either 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th order loop filters, eliminating the need for a bulky passive output filter. Output ripple, sideband noise and spectral emission requirements of different wireless standards can be met by configuring the modulator's filter order and converter's sampling frequency. The proposed converter is entirely digital and is implemented in 14 nm bulk CMOS process for post layout verification. For an input voltage of 3. 3 V, the converter's output can be regulated to any voltage level from 0. 5 V to 2. 5 V, at a nominal switching frequency of 150 MHz. It achieves a maximum efficiency of 94 % at 1. 5 W output power. N/...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{process of}} a regular two-dimensional array of small individual, strongly uniaxial magnetic garnet particles, groups of particles and major loop properties of a ''macroscopic'' sample has been investigated experimentally in an optical magnetometer.

Each particle has a square hysteresis loop, with no reversible or apparent reversible component. Requirements of wiping-out and congruency properties are satisfied. From measurements of the up- and <b>down</b> <b>switching</b> fields on individual particles, the major loop can be reconstructed, and it is shown to be in nearly exact correspondence with the measured one.
