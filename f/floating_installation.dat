40|$|Monopiles are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used support structures for offshore wind turbines with up to 40 m water depth due to the simplicity of the structure. The installation of turbine support structures can be carried out by a jack-up vessel which provides a stable working platform. However, the operational weather window using jack-up vessels is very limited due to the low sea states required for jacking up and down. Compared to jack-up installation vessels, floating vessels have more flexibility due to fast transportations between foundations. However, the vessel motions will affect the motion responses of the lifting objects, which might bring installation difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the dynamic responses of the coupled system to ensure safe offshore operations. In this paper, the installation operation of a monopile using a <b>floating</b> <b>installation</b> vessel is studied by a numerical model. Time domain simulations were carried out to study the installation process of a monopile, including lowering phase, landing phase and steady states after landing. Sensitivity studies were performed focusing on the effects by the gripper device stiffness and landing device stiffness. Comparisons of critical responses by using floating vessel and a jack-up vessel were also studied in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of the mating of the blade of an OWT by a <b>floating</b> <b>installation</b> vessel. A {{state of the art}} analysis of the current practices in the industry shows that jack-up vessels are preferred when it comes to top turbine installation. As the mating of the top turbine components happens at large heights and needs a high degree of precision, the use of jack-up crane vessels that have no wave-induced motions seems relevant. However, the drawbacks of the jack-up operations, such as the important time spent in the leg deployment and the costs of such operations, motivated the writer of this thesis to look for other innovative installation methods. The modeling of a innovative design of tower ring concept, introduced by De Groot, is realized to assess the feasibility of blade mating with floating vessel. This modeling, performed {{with the use of the}} software SIMO, leads to the establishment of the limiting environmental conditions for performing the operation. The results show that the impact of the turbulent wind on the lifted blade is not as critical as the impact of the vessel motions due to the waves. These wave-induced motions are even more critical when the waves are coming from the side of the moored installation vessel. The comparison with the jack-up installation shows that jack-up operations accept limiting sea states of wider significant wave heights and peak periods than the floating vessel installation. One additional problem of the floating vessel is the effect of the mean wave direction, which can limit drastically the allowable sea states when the vessel is not facing the waves. However, the operational time with floating vessels is almost divided by half for a total wind turbine installation compared with the jack-up vessels. The relevance of floating vessels for OWT installation must therefor continue to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of offshore wind farms presents great challenges {{as the industry}} move farther offshore and into deeper waters, and the turbines and foundations are getting larger and heavier. Current installation methods are all sensitive to weather conditions: lifting the foundations using floating crane vessels, deploying and retrieving jack-ups' legs, and lifting turbine nacelles and rotors at a large lift height. Careful numerical studies of these critical installation scenarios in the planning phase are therefore important to ensure safe executions. Monopiles (MP) are {{the most commonly used}} foundations for offshore wind turbines (OWT), but there is little work focusing on their installation phase. In order to predict the responses of the installation system, accurate numerical models and methods are needed. This thesis addresses the modelling and dynamic analysis of two installation phases for monopiles: the lowering into the sea and the initial hammering phases. Due to nonstationarity, current numerical methods used for steady-state conditions are not applicable for simulating the lowering phase. In this thesis, new numerical methods were developed to account for the shielding effects from the <b>floating</b> <b>installation</b> vessel and the radiation damping of the monopile for analysing the nonstationary process. The shielding effects from the vessel are considerable especially in short waves, and the inclusion of the radiation damping of the MP may reduce the predicted responses. These methods also provide more accurate results than the commonly used simplified conservative methods, and they can be extended to apply for other structures. For the initial hammering process, the coupled vessel-monopile installation system with soil interaction was modelled. Dynamic analyses for various monopile penetration depths and soil conditions showed that the responses were sensitive to those factors. These numerical models, methods and dynamic analysis form the basis for assessing the operational limits for different installation activities. The operational limits are essential during the planning phase of the operation, i. e. to size equipment, select installation vessel and optimize the installation method. The allowable sea states together with weather forecasts provide the basis for the decision making during the execution of the operation. Although many studies have focused on obtaining operational limits of specific installation activities, little work has been published on providing a general methodology to establish these limits. Therefore, the thesis also addresses the development of a systematic methodology to assess the operational limits based on the installation procedure, numerical models and safety criteria. To demonstrate the methodology, a detailed procedure for establishing the operational limits is presented for the monopile initial hammering process. First, the critical events and corresponding responses for this operation were identified. The allowable sea states were then obtained by comparing the characteristic responses with their allowable limits. For the monopile lowering process, the allowable sea states were also established using this methodology. An operability analysis at a selected offshore site using different numerical methods was carried out. It was showed that among different modelling parameters, the shielding effect is the most critical factor, followed by the nonstationary analysis approach, wave spreading and the radiation damping from the monopile. The methodology to assess the operational limits is general and can be extended to other marine operations. The original contributions of this work include the development of new methods for simulating the nonstationary lowering operation, and development of a systematic methodology for assessment of the operational limits. These methods provide a basis for further studies on modelling and analysis of other marine operations...|$|E

40|$|Today, the {{petroleum}} industry faces {{more and more}} prospects that are technically impossible and economically unfeasible to drill with conventional methods. This is due to depletion of old reservoirs and increased water depths. As most of the easy-to-drill reservoirs have been discovered, the industry is forced into deeper waters {{to cope with the}} world’s ever increasing demand for energy. This requires innovative thinking and new advanced technology. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) was developed to mitigate these issues. The technology provides for a safe and more efficient drilling environment under conditions where conventional methods may not be adequate. 9 MPD methods have been evaluated in this report. Their technology and equipment have been described in addition to their advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the right MPD method for a planned drilling objective requires sufficient planning and preparation. Several drilling related issues have been discussed up against the different MPD methods. These have been summarized in a table providing an overview for selecting the right MPD method for a specific formation and well. Implementing MPD from <b>floating</b> <b>installations</b> in ultra deep waters requires extra consideration as this often provides for difficulties not experienced onshore or in shallow waters.

40|$|Structural Load & Fatigue on Floating Structures conference, London UK, 25 February 2015 The industrialised and densely {{populated}} coastal regions in China are {{in search of}} local energy supplies {{in order to avoid}} expensive energy transmission from the West of China. Wave energy technology is considered as one of the possible solutions with a potential installed capacity of 13 GW around China. However, typhoons are a major meteorological threat for China’s coastal regions with estimated damages of over 20 bnRMB. Prediction, prevention and mitigation of typhoons have greatly improved and coastal regions at risk are readily identified. This paper will outline the environmental load conditions that are faced by <b>floating</b> <b>installations</b> in the Chinese Sea. The paper assesses the feasibility of novel mooring solutions that aim to absorb energy during the most severe load conditions in order to reduce peak and fatigue loads. Their suitability for wave energy converters in high-intensity typhoon conditions is assessed by a fully-coupled hydrodynamic analysis. Initial modelling has been conducted in the time-domain employing a moored cylindrical buoy with six degrees of freedom. The mooring line properties have been chosen to be characteristic of the strongly nonlinear behaviour of novel mooring designs.

Therefore floating vessels are preferred for future monopile installation; although {{little is known about}} the interaction between ship and monopile during the pile driving process.
