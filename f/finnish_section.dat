50|$|Operation Stella Polaris was {{the cover}} name for {{activity}} in which Finnish signals intelligence records, equipment and personnel were transported into Sweden after {{the ending of the}} Continuation War in 1944 so that the signals intelligence activities could continue in Sweden and the equipment would not end {{up in the hands of}} the Soviet Union. The threat of Soviet occupation was considered too likely and an operation was formed to support guerrilla warfare in Finland after occupation. The operation had its base in the small fishing village of Nämpnäs in Närpes, Ostrobothnia, where the archives were shipped to the Swedish ports. The leaders of the operation was Colonel Aladár Paasonen, chief of the Finnish military intelligence, and Colonel Reino Hallamaa, head of the <b>Finnish</b> signals intelligence <b>section.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Lumber Workers Industrial Union of Canada was a {{trade union}} of lumberjacks in Canada. LWIUC {{was founded in}} Sault Ste.

The two founding national secretaries of LWIUC were Alfred Hautamäki and Kalle Salo, both Finns. A prominent figure in the founding of LWIUC was A. T. Hill, a former wobblie {{and the leader of}} the <b>Finnish</b> <b>section</b> of the Communist Party of Canada. Overall, LWIUC maintained strong links with the Communist Party. Through the halls run by the Finnish Organization of Canada (an organization that was collectively affiliated with the Workers' Party of Canada, the legal front of the Communist Party), LWIUC rapidly gained thousands of members. The headquarters of the LWIUC were initially at Port Arthur.|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of obesity—a clear signal of weight abnormality—on unemployment and earnings among Finnish men and women. Our empirical data consist {{of the last four}} waves (waves 4 to 8) of the <b>Finnish</b> <b>section</b> of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) data collected between 1998 and 2001. According to our results, obese women have a significantly higher risk of unemployment (even after controlling for age, level of education and other related factors), than women who are not obese. Furthermore, the generally weaker occupational positions of obese women tend to translate to lower earnings. Overall, obese {{women are more likely to}} have weaker labour market attachment  and hold socio-economically weaker positions. Similar results were not found among men. Thus, our results indicate the presence of gender discrimination in the Finnish labour market. In the conclusions we further discuss weight related impacts on succeeding in the labour market, but also its role as a possible risk factor in drifting away from employment. We reflect on this issue as a form of inequality that can have an increasing significance in the future...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{panel of}} four kallikrein markers (total, free, and intact prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and human kallikrein-related {{peptidase}} 2 [hK 2]) improves predictive accuracy for Gleason score ≥ 7 (high-grade) prostate cancer among men biopsied for elevated PSA. A four-kallikrein panel model was originally developed and validated by the Dutch {{center of the}} European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). The kallikrein panel is now commercially available as 4 Kscore™. Objective: To assess whether these findings could be replicated among participants in the <b>Finnish</b> <b>section</b> of ERSPC (FinRSPC) and whether β-microseminoprotein (MSP), a candidate prostate cancer biomarker, adds predictive value. Design, setting, and participants: Among 4861 biopsied screening-positive participants {{in the first three}} screening rounds of FinRSPC, a case-control subset was selected that included 1632 biopsy-positive cases matched by age at biopsy to biopsy-negative controls. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The predictive accuracy of prespecified prediction models was compared with biopsy outcomes. Results and limitations: Among men with PSA of 4. 0 - 25. ng/ml, 1111 had prostate cancer, 318 of whom had high-grade disease. Total PSA and age predicted high-grade cancer with an area under the curve of 0. 648 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 614 - 0. 681) and the four-kallikrein panel increased discrimination to 0. 746 (95 % CI 0. 717 - 0. 774). Adding MSP to the four-kallikrein panel led to a significant (Wald test; p = 0. 015) but small increase (0. 003) in discrimination. Limitations include a risk of verification bias among men with PSA of 3. 0 - 3. 99. ng/ml and the absence of digital rectal examination results. Conclusions: These findings provide additional evidence that kallikrein markers can be used to inform biopsy decision-making. Further studies are needed to define the role of MSP. Patient summary: Four kallikrein markers and β-microseminoprotein in blood improve discrimination of high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen. Four kallikrein markers and β-microseminoprotein (MSP) in blood improve discrimination of high-grade cancer at biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen.

40|$|Background The {{measurement}} of health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) has become an important health outcome among prostate cancer patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening can be effective at detecting prostate cancer at an early stage. However, the screening {{can be associated with}} overdetection and overtreatment, resulting in a decreased HRQoL among patients. Since health care resources are limited, assessing HRQoL is crucially important to evaluate the acceptability of PSA screening. The main purpose of this thesis was to investigate the association between the treatment-related adverse effects of prostate cancer and HRQoL by using the generic HRQoL instrument, the 15 D, in a Finnish randomised population-based prostate cancer screening trail. Patients and methods Data was collected from men with prostate cancer in the <b>Finnish</b> <b>section</b> of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). In the Finnish screening trial, approximately 20, 000 men aged 55, 59, 63 and 67 from Helsinki and Tampere regions were randomly allocated to the screening arm, the remaining was treated as controls. From the period between May 1996 and Dec 2002, a total of 1667 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from the screening population were identified. Of these, 1417 men with prostate cancer who completed questionnaires were included in this study. The validated generic HRQoL measure, the 15 D was used to measure HRQoL and the study focused both on overall HRQoL and three dimensions of the 15 D (sleeping, elimination and sexual activity). Treatment-related side effects (urinary, sexual, bowel and hormone dimensions) were measured based on patient self-reports.   Results Both HRQoL and the prevalence of side effects were not statistically significantly different between screening and control groups whereas treatment choices between the two groups were statistically significantly different. The mean scores of sleeping and sexual dimensions of the 15 D and the mean 15 D scores of the screening population were statistically significantly lower in comparison with reference population. Treatment choices were associated with the prevalence of prostate-specific side effects, the sexual dimension of the 15 D and overall HRQoL. Sex-related symptoms were the most common side effects and higher occurrence was observed in surgery patients. The presence of erectile side effects was associated with the sexual dimension of the 15 D and overall HRQoL. However, other side effects were not found {{to be related to the}} three dimensions (sleeping, elimination and sexual activity) of the 15 D or overall HRQoL. After adjusting for a number of factors, patients who experienced the worst sexual health state of the 15 D were highly likely to have more comorbidites, the presence of diabetes and to be married. The impact of active treatment was more related to the second worst sexual health state of the 15 D.   Conclusions Sexual dysfunction caused by treatment negatively impacted both the sexual dimension of HRQoL and overall HRQoL. The use of the 15 D facilitated to measure overall HRQoL which covered prostate specific dimensions among prostate cancer patients. Since prostate cancer is common in elderly populations, more efforts are needed to accurately measure treatment-related side effects as well as their general health conditions. The findings from this study can be useful when assessing the negative effects of screening in terms of HRQoL and costs. Asiasanat:quality of life; prostate cancer; screenin...|$|E
