25|$|A truly red bearded iris, like a truly blue rose, {{remains an}} unattained goal despite {{frequent}} hybridizing and selection. There are species and selections, most notably {{based on the}} beardless rhizomatous Copper iris (I. fulva), which have a relatively pure red color. However, <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> color into a modern bearded iris breed has proven very difficult, and thus, {{the vast majority of}} irises are in the purple and blue range of the color spectrum, with yellow, pink, orange and white breeds also available.|$|E
25|$|The American Cancer Society {{estimates}} that in 2014, about 5,980 {{new cases of}} chronic myelogenous leukemia were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease.

25|$|Several {{media outlets}} have {{published}} stories regarding {{the cancellation of}} the program. The non-renewal {{of the program was}} also a surprise considering the ratings that the show was generating. Shortly before the cancellation of the show, local papers described <b>Get</b> <b>This</b> as 'so popular that the Austereo network doesn't {{know what to do with}} them'. In Melbourne, <b>Get</b> <b>This</b> was second in its slot, while the station is fifth overall.

25|$|Any prey {{that has}} the ability to jump or fly away will always be more {{effective}} in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, even just <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> one appendage as a food source is a victory. For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.|$|E
25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T gene (ATM) and one copy which is mutated. A-T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A-T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born to the parents will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) {{can be carried out}} in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child’s two ATM genes have been identified. The process of <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> done can be complicated and, as it requires time, should be arranged before conception.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century new {{railways}} were proposed which were likely to enable the Barry Railway to encroach on the GWR area of dominance at Swansea. The R was a possible means of <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> access if another railway could get control, or running powers, and this motivated the GWR to negotiate with the R for control. In 1906 agreement was reached by which the GWR took over the management of the R system in return for generous financial guarantees. The colliery activity in the area was at its peak and the R directors were able to use this fact to the advantage of their shareholders in the negotiation. The ordinary dividend of the R had been % in 1902; the GWR now guaranteed 3% rising to 5% in 1907. This was in effect a lease; the arrangement took effect from 30 June 1906.|$|E

25|$|Williams was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 18 March 1943. After four hectic months with the XII Air Support Command, Williams returned to troops carriers as commander of the Northwest African Air Force Troop Carrier Command (Provisional). This had been created on 21 March 1943 to handle the airborne phase of Operation HUSKY, the Allied invasion of Sicily. In addition to the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, the Troop Carrier Command included the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and No. 38 Wing, RAF. <b>Getting</b> <b>this</b> force ready for action was a major challenge. The 51st was assigned {{to work with the}} British and the 52nd with the Americans because the 51st had prior experience working with the British in North Africa, and its aircraft had been modified to work with British troops. However the British plan called for a glider infantry mission and the 51st had no experience with gliders, whereas the 52nd had conducted training with gliders before leaving the United States, but was committed to a parachute mission. Gliders were delivered disassembled and a major effort was required to assemble the required number of gliders. In the meantime, valuable training time was lost.|$|E

On his debut Kisnorbo {{suffered}} a head wound which required stitches, after receiving stitches to the wound off the pitch {{he came out}} wearing a head bandage. After playing for Australia on 12 August, Kisnorbo became Leeds's 100th full international player. Whilst at Leeds he {{established himself as a}} fans' favourite for his solid performances and his brave style of play. After suffering the head injury, which required 12 stitches, Kisnorbo wore a protective headband.

500|$|There were {{difficulties}} <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> episode up to {{the minimum}} length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production. The episode starts with a repeat of a couch gag that was first used in the episode [...] "Lisa's First Word", which is considerably longer than the typical couch gag. The crew added an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon and a few misleads as to {{who was trying to}} kill Bart. Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. This {{led to the creation of}} the rake sequence, which became a memorable moment of the episode, and the entire series. Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row. According to executive producer Al Jean, the idea was to make the scene funny, then drag the joke out so that it is no longer funny, and then drag it out even longer to make it funny again.|$|E

Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. <b>Getting</b> <b>this</b> role, in hindsight...

500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length.

[...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans...

[...] Myra Dehais of RED Company claimed that the song's rise at adult-radio stations was a result of the company's distribution, saying [...] "This is a proud moment for RED distribution, [...] In crossing a country song over to the adult and pop formats, we can face resistance, since (some) stations have only a slot or two for country music, in order to maintain sonic balance.

500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not <b>getting</b> <b>this.</b> So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E
500|$|The States of New York and New Jersey {{also needed}} to approve the project, given their control and {{oversight}} role of the Port Authority. Objections to the plan came from New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner, who resented that New York would be <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> $335 million project. Meanwhile, ridership on New Jersey's Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H) had declined substantially {{from a high of}} 113million riders in 1927 to 26million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the Hudson River. Toward the end of 1961, negotiations with outgoing New Jersey Governor Meyner regarding the World Trade Center project reached a stalemate. In December 1961, Tobin met with newly elected New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, and made a proposal to shift the World Trade Center project to a west side site where the Hudson Terminal was located. In acquiring the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, the Port Authority would also acquire the Hudson Terminal and other buildings which were deemed obsolete. On January 22, 1962, the two states reached an agreement to allow the Port Authority to take over the railroad and to build the World Trade Center on Manhattan's lower west side. [...] The shift in location for the World Trade Center to a site more convenient to New Jersey, together with Port Authority acquisition of the H Railroad, brought New Jersey to agreement in support of the World Trade Center project.|$|E
