40|$|Proposed {{are simple}} and {{available}} techniques {{that can be}} used for rapid and reliable environmental control specifically of natural water by means of instrumental and visual tests in outdoor conditions. Developed are the chemical colorimetric modes for fast detection of socially dangerous trace impurities in water such as Co(II), Pd(II), and Rh(III) as well as NO 2 [...] ions and Fe(III) serving as model impurities. Application of portable digital devices and scanner allows estimating the color coordinates and increasing the accuracy and sensitivity of the tests. The combination of complex formation with preconcentration of colored complexes replaces the sensitive but time-consuming and capricious kinetic method that is usually used for this purpose at the more convenient and reliable colorimetric method. As the test tools, the following ones are worked out: polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>tablets</b> with sorbed colored complexes, the two-layer paper sandwich packaged in slide adapter and saturated by reagents, and polyethylene terephthalate blister with dried reagents. Fast analysis of polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>tablets</b> is realized using a pocket digital RGB-colorimeter or portable photometer. Express analysis of two-layer paper sandwich or polyethylene terephthalate blister is realized by visual and instrumental tests.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the {{acceptability}} {{of a variety of}} formulations of female-controlled methods of protection against HIV and STDs among men and women in south-western Uganda. Pilot interviews were carried out with 50 men and 55 women and 25 focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with 138 women and 42 men. The female condom, <b>foaming</b> <b>tablets,</b> sponge, <b>foam,</b> gel and film were demonstrated to 146 women and 35 of their male partners, who then tried out 2 of the products. They were interviewed 7 times during the course of 5 months. At the end experiences were evaluated during a second series of FGDs. Sixty-five (45 %) women completed the trial. The main reasons for non-completion were related to geographical mobility. Product preference after the initial demonstration was similar to {{that at the end of}} the trial. The most popular formulations were the sponge (25 % of the women), <b>foaming</b> <b>tablets</b> (23 %), and the female condom (19 %). The foam was of medium popularity (16 %). The gel (9 %) and film (7 %) were least popular. Ten per cent of the women and 14 % of the men reported products interfering with sexual enjoyment; 24 % of the women and 67 % of the men said products increased enjoyment. 'Dry sex' is not popular in this area and increased lubrication was an important determinant of acceptability. Age, level of education and location did have some effect on preference. Although secrecy was a dominant theme in the FGDs, 87 % of the women had informed their partners by the end of the trial. The products were generally well received. Female control was an important issue for both sexes. Male attitudes were ambivalent because female ownership of products increased women's control. Although they have clear preferences, women appear to accept the products generally and might use a single available product just as readily if choice was limited, as long as it conforms to general cultural preferences, such as those relating to wet/dry sex...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} qualitative methods in operations research on a family planning service delivery system. Market traders in Ibadan, Nigeria were trained to sell oral contraceptives, condoms, and spermicidal <b>foaming</b> <b>tablets</b> in a collaborative research project of the Fertility Research Unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and the Center for Population and Family Health of Columbia University. Focus group discussion, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews were used to investigate the cultural acceptability of distribution of contraceptives in the market places and the motivations of participating traders. The strength of the market associations was a factor influencing acceptance {{of the project and}} the number of customers for the traders' other wares were found to positively influence the volume of sales of contraceptives. Traders were motivated by the status associated with participating in a program of a well-known health institution.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{assessed}} {{the acceptability of}} three nonoxynol- 9 spermicides among persons attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS. Spermicidal foam, suppositories, and <b>foaming</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated. Women (n = 114) and men (n = 150) attending an sexually transmitted disease clinic were enrolled. After each participant used two products, each for 2 weeks, consistency of use and acceptability were evaluated. RESULTS. At admission, most women (74 %) and men (58 %) were not using any family planning method. Moreover, most women (85 %) and men (98 %) {{had at least one}} sexually transmitted disease or genital infection. During the study, the proportion of coital episodes protected by spermicide use was high, yet loss to follow-up and discontinuation were also substantial. Discontinuation was frequently unrelated to acceptability. Women and men rated all three products positively along several acceptability parameters. Foam was the least desirable delivery system due to excess messiness. CONCLUSIONS. The {{results of this study suggest}} that it is feasible to distribute spermicides to women and men at increased risk for sexually transmitted disease and that the products will be used. Further research should be done among different populations and include other spermicidal delivery mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Developed out express Sorption-colorimetric {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of iron in water, based on the sorption concentration of detecting component of the solution impregnated in the polyurethane foam, the formation {{on the surface of}} a colored compound and then its definition in the sorbent matrix by measuring color intensity or chromaticity characteristics. The first method is based on determining the agitation of the sample solution with a tablet impregnated with PPU known mass, from which the air bubbles are removed, the second dynamic – by sampling by suction solution in the analytical cartridge impregnated with PPU. Discoloration polyurethane indicates the presence of iron (III) in water, and its content was determined by comparing the color intensity of <b>foam</b> <b>tablets</b> previously prepared color chart or chromaticity characteristics comparing analyte and standard solutions. The conditions of sorption-photometric analysis: the concentration of the photometric reagent impregnated in the foam, the degree of loading it impregnant, the phases of contact, the acidity of the environment. When using analytical cartridges lower limit of detection is 2 times higher, and the measurement error to 3. 5 % lower than with the tablets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new foaming {{process has}} been {{developed}} for epoxy resins. Uncured epoxy tablets are fabricated by pressing commercial powders in a steel mold at room temperature and used as <b>foam</b> precursors. The <b>tablets</b> <b>foam</b> when heated in a muffle at high temperature. No blowing agent was added because the foaming mechanism depends on the uncured resin boiling point. The foaming temperature is set to be high enough to rapidly produce the resin boiling but not excessive to avoid the thermal degradation. During boiling, the epoxy resin polymerizes and the bubbles freeze in the final structure. Epoxy foams are obtained by heating the compacted tablets in cylindrical copper molds, having internal diameter equal to the tablet diameter. Several process parameters have been changed in the experiment to understand their correlation with the foaming efficiency. However, the foaming ratio (expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio between the final and the initial tablet height) is found to be mainly dependent on the initial tablet density. In optimal conditions, the foaming ratio can rise up to 6. Thermal tests have been performed to evaluate the epoxy powder behavior during the cure, whereas mechanical compression tests were used to evaluate the final performances of the foams.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of different methods used in the therapy of retained placenta on conception rate and duration of days open in cows. Research was performed on 241 Simmental cows aged 2 - 8 years divided in three groups. The first group of cows (group A) (n= 82) with retained placenta was treated with manual extraction of placenta 12 - 24 h after parturition combined with application of intrauterine antibiotics. The second group (group B) (n= 79) with retained placenta was treated with intrauterine antibiotics only 12 - 24 h after parturition and repeated 2 - 3 times in 48 h intervals. The third group (group C) (n= 80) was the control group and had physiological puerperium (without retained placenta). To assess the reproductive performance of Simmental cows, interval from calving to first insemination (days open to first service, DOFS), interval from calving to pregnancy (days open to pregnancy, DOP), relative pregnancy rate (%), first service conception rate (FSCR, %) and all service conception rate (ASCR, %) were measured. The estimate of hazard ratio for DOFS in group A relative to cows in group B was 2. 20 (p< 0. 0001), implying that cows in group B had oestrus earlier and were open shorter until the first insemination, that is, the relative rate of first service decreased by 54. 5 % in the group A while holding all other variables constant. The variable that had a significant influence on DOFS was lactation (HR= 0. 99; p< 0. 0001). The estimate of hazard ratio for DOP in group A relative to cows in group B and C was 3. 53 (p< 0. 0001) and 1. 73 (p< 0. 0001), respectively, implying that cows in group B and C were open longer until pregnancy, that is, the relative rate of pregnancy in group A decreased by 71. 6 % and 42. 2 % in comparison with group B and C while holding all other variables constant. Variables that had a significant influence on DOP were lactation (HR= 0. 99; p< 0. 0001) and peripartal diseases (HR= 0. 48; p= 0. 02). The estimate of hazard ratio for DOFS and DOP between group B and C was not significant.

50|$|Products were {{introduced}} in late 1975. By {{the end of the}} following year, they had spread to all urban markets, and sales reached 4.9 million Raja condoms and about 250,000 cycles of Maya oral contraceptive pills. In 1979, the Joy brand <b>foaming</b> spermicidal <b>tablet,</b> donated by the Japanese, was introduced and sold about 3 million pieces. (Joy was discontinued in 1989 when the Japanese ceased supplying it and no other donor could be found. About 50 million tablets had been distributed.) In 1980, a second pill brand called Ovacon was introduced. Total sales for that year were 33.4 million Raja and over 600,000 pill cycles. In 1982, after the original contract with PSI had been renewed twice, USAID decided to change to a cooperative agreement, which now expires at the end of FY 1992 for family planning and FY 1994 for oral rehydration therapy (ORT). By 1983, a second brand of condoms (Panther) was introduced. Condom sales reached 76 million that year, with pills up to 1.7 million. PSI was asked to call in an outside agency to assist in producing a motivational campaign to promote the virtues of the small family, birth spacing, male responsibility, and the like, through mass media. This campaign was designed by Manoff International Inc. and ran for five years until an unexpected cut in USAID funding. During 1985, SMP introduced a third condom, the ultra-thin Majestic. Total condom sales passed the 100 million mark {{for the first time and}} pills the 2 million mark. ORSaline (a brand of oral rehydration salts) was introduced in the same year; initial annual sales of 120,000 have now grown to 10-12 million. By 1985, SMP employed almost 500 people, and its sales force was regarded as among the best in Bangladesh.|$|R

In the main male partners were told as women felt it their duty to inform them. In general the women were very much more positive about the products than they were about the male condom, as were the men. A contributory factor to their popularity among women was the greater control they gave them. Even though, use of these products in practice often involved negotiation with male partners, the fact that use was contingent on women's action was empowering and increased somewhat their ability to control their sexual health.
