5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him to believe that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known}} as the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|The SAS team tracks down Al-Asad in Azerbaijan, and {{discover}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Imran Zakhaev, {{the leader of}} the Ultranationalist party. The mission then flashes back to 1996, where Captain Price, who was a Lieutenant at the time, is sent alongside his commanding officer, Captain MacMillan, on a failed assassination attempt on Imran Zakhaev. After killing Al-Asad, the SAS team, with support from U.S. Force Recon and Russian loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son and learn his whereabouts. They ambush him, but he commits suicide. In response, Zakhaev seizes control of a nuclear launch facility. A joint operation is launched to take back the site, but Zakhaev launches intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. eastern seaboard. The joint teams are able to breach the facility and remotely destroy the missiles before fleeing the area.|$|E
