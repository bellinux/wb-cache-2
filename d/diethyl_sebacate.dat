We {{described a}} case of allergic contact dermatitis from <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> in a topical antimycotic medicament. Allergic reaction to <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> is likely more common because our group has found three of eight sensitized cases.

40|$|Enzymatically catalyzed {{polycondensation}} of p-xylylenediamine and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> {{resulted in}} oligo(p-xylylene sebacamide) with high melting temperatures (223 − 230 °C) and the enzymatic polycondensation of dimethyl terephthalate and 1, 8 -diaminooctane leads to oligo(octamethylene terephthalamide) with two melting temperatures at 186 and 218 °C. No oligoamides, but two other products, were formed from the enzymatic reaction of dimethyl terephthalate and p-xylylenediamine. All reactions were catalyzed by CAL-B, icutinase, or CLEA cutinase. All reactions catalyzed by CAL-B show higher conversion than reactions catalyzed by icutinase or CLEA cutinase. The highest DPmax of 15 was achieved in a one-step and two-step synthesis of oligo(p-xylylene sebacamide) catalyzed by CLEA cutinase. ...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase {{partitioning}} bioreactors offer {{many advantages}} {{for the removal}} of toxic pollutants. In particular, such systems can be loaded with very large quantities of pollutants without risks of microbial inhibition, they are self-regulated and they prevent the risks of hazardous pollutant volatilisation during aerobic treatment. However, their potential has never been tested at low temperatures. Phenol biodegradation by a cold adapted Pseudomonas strain was therefore tested at 14 or 4 degrees C using 2 -undecanone, <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> or 2 -decanone as organic phases in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor. The three solvents were biocompatible at 14 degrees C but evidence was found that <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> was biodegraded by the bacteria and this solvent was not tested further. Although only 2 -decanone was suitable at 4 degrees C, phenol biodegradation was more efficient in 2 -undecanone at WC, reaching a maximum volumetric rate (based on the volume of aqueous phase) of approximately 1. 94 g/L-day after 47 h of cultivation. In 2 -clecanone at 14 degrees C, evidence was found that phenol degradation was limited by the release of biosurfactants, which increased the solubility and toxicity of the solvent in the aqueous phase inhibiting microbial activity. This study therefore shows that pollutant removal at low temperature is feasible but that the production of biosurfactants can {{have a negative impact on}} the process and must be taken into consideration when selecting the organic solvent. Future work should therefore focus on the selection of solvents suitable for use at temperatures below 14 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|The size-dependent {{particle}} {{transmission efficiency}} of the aerodynamic lens system used in the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) was investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and experimental measurements. The CFD calculations revealed that the entire lens system, including the aerodynamic lens itself, the critical orifice which defines the operating lens pressure, and a valve assembly, needs to be considered. Previous calculations considered only the aerodynamic lens. The calculations also investigated the effect of operating the lens system at two different sampling pressures, 7. 8 × 104 Pa (585 torr) and 1. 0 × 105 Pa (760 torr). Experimental measurements of transmission efficiency were performed with size-selected <b>diethyl</b> hexyl <b>sebacate</b> (DEHS), NH 4 NO 3, and NaNO 3 particles on three different AMS instruments at two different ambient sampling pressures (7. 8 × 104 Pa, 585 torr and 1. 0 × 105 Pa, 760 torr). Comparisons of the measurements and the calculations showqualitative agreement, but there are significant deviations which are as yet unexplained. On the small size end (30 nm to 150 nm vacuum aerodynamic diameter), the measured transmission efficiency is lower than predicted. On the large size end (3 ̆e 350 nm vacuum aerodynamic diameter...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{filtration}} using electrospun {{cellulose acetate}} filters with different mean fiber diameters is reported, {{and the results}} are compared with those for two conventional filter media, a glass fiber filter and a cellulose acetate microfiber filter. The performance of these filters was studied using two aerosols, one solid (NaCl) and one liquid (<b>diethyl</b> hexyl <b>sebacate),</b> under conditions of relatively high face velocity (45 cm/s). The experimental observations are compared to theoretical predictions based on single fiber filtration efficiency. Our results indicate that the mechanisms for single fiber filtration efficiency provide reasonable predictions of the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), in the range of 40 – 270 nm, percentage penetration from 0. 03 to 70 %, and fiber diameter in the range from 0. 1 to 24 µm. Using an analysis based on blocking filtration laws, we conclude that filtration by cake formation dominated in the case of NaCl aerosols on electrospun filter media, whereas filters with larger fiber diameter showed a transition in mechanisms, from an initial regime characterized by pore blocking to a later regime characterized by cake formation. The liquid aerosol did not exhibit cake formation, even for the smallest fiber diameters, and also had much smaller influence on pressure drop than did the solid aerosol. The electrospun filters demonstrated slightly better quality factors compared to the commercial glass fiber filter, at a much lower thickness. In general, this study demonstrates control of the properties of electrospun cellulose acetate fibers for air filtration application. Philip Morris Internationa...|$|R
40|$|Polyamides, or nylon, {{are widely}} used in fiber and {{engineering}} plastic materials, due to their good mechanical and thermal properties. Synthesis of oligomers from nylon- 4, 10, nylon- 6, 10, and nylon- 8, 10 were performed via polycondensation of diamines (1, 4 -butanediamine, 1, 6 -hexanediamine, and 1, 8 -diaminooctane) and diester (<b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate).</b> These reactions were catalyzed by immobilized cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi on Lewatit beads, cutinase {{in the form of}} cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA), or by immobilized Lipase B from Candida antarctica (N 435). The highest maximal degree of polymerization (DPmax), up to 16, can be achieved in the synthesis of nylon- 8, 10 catalyzed by CLEA cutinase in diphenyl ether at 70 °C. By performing a reaction at cutinase optimal temperature (70 °C), CLEA cutinase in the synthesis of nylons shows good catalytic activity, like N 435. ...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{extraction}} of valeric acid from water by tri-n-propyl amine (TPA) and dibenzyl amine (DBA) dissolved in polar oxygenated aliphatic diluents (<b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> diethyl succinate, diethyl malonate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl valerate and isoamyl alcohol) {{has been studied}} at T = 298 ± 0. 2 K and Pp = 101. 3 ± 0. 7 kPa. Distribution data {{have been subjected to}} formulation of an optimization structure for effective acid separation. The optimization approach uses separation ratio R and synergistic enhancement SE factors to efficiently identify optimum extraction ranges. Among the examined aliphatic ester and alcohol diluents, monoesters exhibit higher solvation efficiency comprising acid 1 –amine 1 complex formation, while isoamyl alcohol yields larger loading factors. The uptake capacity of the amine/diluent system is ranging in the order TPA > DBA. Modeling efforts based on the mass-action law principles have shown considerable success. The mass action law chemodel and modified Langmuir approach are quite accurate yielding mean errors of 0. 9 % and 0. 7 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Intermolecular {{electron}} transfer and geminate recombination are explored experimentally in both {{solid and liquid}} solutions using the same donor-acceptor pair. The solvents were chosen to have similar chemical and dielectric properties, but vastly different viscosities. Systems of an electron donor, rubrene, and varying concentrations of an electron acceptor, duroquinone, were studied. The solvents used were <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (liquid) and sucrose octaacetate (solid). Forward {{electron transfer}} was studied using time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence measurements {{for a variety of}} acceptor concentrations. Electron back-transfer (geminate recombination) was measured using pumpprobe experiments. The data were analyzed using a theoretical treatment that takes into account diffusion of the donor and acceptors, a distance-dependent (exponential) transfer rate, Coulomb interactions between the ions generated by the forward transfer, and donor-acceptor and acceptor-acceptor excluded volumes. The forward transfer data, in both the solid and liquid solutions, are in very good agreement with calculations. Virtually identical forward transfer parameters are obtained from the solid and liquid samples. The back-transfer parameters obtained from the measurements on solid solution are able to reproduce the liquid solution’s back-transfer data, but only when the high-frequency dielectric constant is used. The use of this value for the dielectric constant is discussed. I...|$|E
40|$|Biotechnologically {{accessible}} 1, 4 -butanediol and vegetal oil-based <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> were copolymerized with bicyclic acetalized d-glucose derivatives (Glux) by polycondensation both in {{the melt}} at high temperature and in solution at mild temperature mediated by polymer-supported Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). Two series of random copolyesters (PBxGluxySeb and PBSebxGluxy) were prepared differing in which d-glucose derivative (Glux diol or Glux diester) was used as comonomer. The three parent homopolyesters PBSeb, PBGlux, and PGluxSeb were prepared as well. Both methods {{were found to be}} effective for polymerization although significant higher molecular weights were achieved by melt polycondensation. The thermal properties displayed by the copolyesters were largely dependent on composition and also on the functionality of the replacing Glux unit. The thermal stability of PBSeb was retained or even slightly increased after copolymerization with Glux, whereas crystallinity and melting temperature were largely depressed. On the contrary, the glass-transition temperature noticeably increased with the content in Glux units. PGluxSeb distinguished in displaying both Tg and Tm higher than PBSeb because a different crystal structure is adopted by this homopolyester. The hydrolytic degradability of PBSeb in water was enhanced by copolymerization, in particular, when biodegradation was assisted by lipases. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
40|$|AIM: In this work, {{we report}} {{the use of}} {{plasticized}} polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a potential antifouling coating material. The materials contain a variety of sebacic and succinic acid-derived plasticisers providing a variation in molecular shape and structure; diethyl succinate (DESn), di-(2 -ethylhexyl sebacate) (DEHS), dibutyl sebacate (DBS), and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DES). Each plasticiser from the sebacate group possessed the same basic C 10 H 16 O 4 moiety with varied dialkyl terminated groups, affording a different range of homologous series plasticisers. This work investigates whether branching of the side substituted alkyl chains on each plasticiser molecule affects microorganism attachment and subsequent fouling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plasticized polymers are spin coated to create thin films for testing. In {{order to determine the}} antifouling capacity of the materials, the polymer coatings underwent a series of analyses for biomass determination, glycocalyx production, and protein and carbohydrate adsorption. Topological and morphological characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). RESULTS: After a 7 day laboratory biofouling study {{it was found that the}} plasticisers with increased alkyl branching, DESN, and DEHS revealed the greatest degree of prevention of microorganism colonization and attachment thus significantly reducing the initial formation of biofilms by up to 65 % in some biofouling assays when compared to the uPVC blank...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{determinations}} of {{the dynamics}} of photoinduced electron transfer from rubrene to duroquinone in three solvents, dibutyl phthalate, <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> and cyclohexanone are presented. Measurements of the donor (rubrene) fluorescence decays were made with time-correlated single-photon counting. The data are analyzed using recent theoretical developments that include important features of the solvent, i. e., the effects of finite molecular volume on local solvent structure and on the mutual donor-acceptor diffusion rates. Inclusion of the liquid radial distribution function (rdf) in the theory accounts for the significant variation of the acceptor concentration near a donor. Because the concentration of acceptors near a donor is substantially greater than the average concentration used in a featureless continuum liquid model, incorporating the rdf is necessary to properly analyze experimental data. Hydrodynamic effects, which slow the rate of donoracceptor approach at short distance, are important and are also included in the theoretical analysis of the data. The data analysis depends on a reasonable model of the rdf. A hard-sphere liquid rdf is shown to be sufficiently accurate by comparing model electron-transfer calculations using a hard-sphere rdf and an rdf from neutronscattering experiments reported in the literature. A method is presented to obtain the hard-sphere parameters needed to calculate the rdf. The method uses a self-consistent determination of the hard-sphere radius and diffusion constant and the solvent self-diffusion constant calculated from the Spernol and Wirtz equation...|$|E
40|$|The coupled {{processes}} of intermolecular photoinduced forward electron transfer and geminate recombination between donors (rubrene) and acceptors (duroquinone) are studied in two molecular liquids: dibutyl phthalate and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sebacate.</b> Time-correlated single-photon counting and fluorescence yield measurements give {{information about the}} depletion of the donor excited state due to forward transfer, while pump-probe experiments give direct information about the radical survival kinetics. A straightforward procedure is presented for removing contributions from excited-state-excited-state absorption to the pump-probe data. The data are analyzed with a previously presented model that includes solvent structure and hydrodynamic effects in a detailed theory of through-solvent electron transfer. Models that neglect these effects are incapable of describing the data. When {{a detailed description of}} solvent effects is included in the theory, agreement with the experimental results is obtained. Forward electron transfer is well-described with a classical Marcus form of the rate equation, though the precise values of the rate parameters depend on the details of the solvents’ radial distribution function. The additional experimental results presented here permit a more accurate determination of the forward transfer parameters than those presented previously. 1 The geminate recombination (back transfer) data are highly inverted and cannot be analyzed with a classical Marcus expression. Good fits are instead obtained with an exponential distance dependence model of the rate constant and also with a more detailed semiclassical treatment suggested by Jortner. 2 Analysis of the pump-probe data, however, suggests that the geminate recombination cannot be described with a single solvent dielectric constant. Rather, a time-dependent dielectric constant is required to properly account for diffusion occurring in a time-varying Coulomb potential. A model using a longitudinal dielectric relaxation time is presented. Additionally, previously reported theoretical results 3 are rederived in a general form that permits important physical effects to be included more rigorously...|$|E
