40|$|Bilirubin {{load test}} was {{performed}} to differenciate hyperbilirubinemia in various liver diseases. For this purpose, bilirubin excretion pattern, serum direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>bilirubins,</b> and the molar ratio of glucuronic acid to bilirubin in the ester-form bilirubin fraction separated by Kosaka and Hera's method were investigated. Phenobarbital was effective to decrease serum bilirubin in Gilbert's syndrome, so this phenomena was investigated {{from the point of}} bilirubin metabolism. The following results were obtained: 1) Serum total bilirubin markedly elevated after bilirubin loading in Gilbert's syndrome, and direct bilirubin was increased significantly, and the molar ratio of glucuronic acid to bilirubin was lower than normal, which was coincided with the low activity of UDPGA bilirubin glucuronyl transferase in liver tissue. 2) Serum total bilirubin after bilirubin loading in Dubin-Johnson syndrome showed high retention, and many peaks were observed in direct bilirubin, which showed high value. Molar ratio flucutiated in normal range. These findings support the prolonged excretion of serum bilirubin in this disease due to the bilirubin circulation from liver cell to microbili. 3) In Rotor syndrome, retention of serum total bilirubin after bilirubin loading was not so high, and serum direct bilirubin increased and the molar ratio was in normal range. 4) Excretion of serum bilirubin slightly delayed in posthepatitic hyperbilirubinemia after bilirubin loading, and serum direct bilirubin and molar raio showed normal pattern. 5) Phenobarbital administration in Gilbert's syndrome was effective to decrease serum bilirubin, and serum bilirubin increased after stopping the drug administration.

Methods: This article updates the current knoweledge concerning the jaundice's etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and complications ant treatment by reviewing of the latest medical literature. It also presents an approach of jaundice's treatment and pathogenesis, in special populations as in neonates and pregnant women. Results: The treatment is consistent in the management of the subjective diseases responsible for the jaundice and its complications. The clinical prognosis of the jaundice depends on the etiology. Surgical treatment of jaundiced patients is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Studies have shown that the severity of jaundice and the presence of malignant disease are importan risk factors for post-operative mortality.

40|$|Jaundice is {{probably}} the most common newborn infant problem dealt with on a daily basis by the family practitioner and paediatrician. Jaundice occurs when the liver cannot clear a sufficient amount of bilirubin from the plasma. When the problem is excessive bilirubin formation or limited uptake or conjugation, unconjugated (i. e., <b>indirect</b> reacting) <b>bilirubin</b> appears in the blood and indirect hyperbilirubinemia is the predominant form of jaundice found in the newborn infant. In the vast majority of newborns, hyperbilirubinemia is transient and benign but, in rare cases, the serum bilirubin rises to a level that is toxic to the central nervous system. Understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; recognizing, the problems involved in appropriate surveillance and monitoring of the jaundiced infant and the factors contributing to bilirubin encephalopathy; and implementing treatment of the jaundiced neonate in a timely fashion, are issues that have engaged clinicians and researchers for some 6 decades. This work will summarize my contributions to the field of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and it includes papers published between 1971 and 2007.

Simple methods for the preparation of true bilirubin standards and a stable control serum are described. In a very careful study Nosslin (1960) showed that the method of Jendrassik and Grof (1938) for the estimation of total serum bilirubin had many advan-tages over other methods and that a modification of it gave a direct reaction which was the best available index of conjugated bilirubin in the serum. In the total bilirubin method the serum was mixed with a buffered caffeine solution which acted as an accelerator and then with diazo reagent. The azo pigment formed was converted from red to blue by the addition of alkali. In the direct reaction the accelerator solution was replaced by water and the diazo reaction terminated by ascorbic acid before treatment with alkali. Serum blanks were prepared with diazo I instead of mixed diazo reagent. The methods currently recommended for the determina-tion of bilirubin on the Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Gambino and Schreiber, 1964) are based on these procedures. Michaelsson (1961) demonstrated a number of disadvantages in Nosslin's method. First, caffeine was found to reduce the optical density of alkaline azobilirubin solutions. Since it was used in the total bilirubin, but not direct bilirubin estimations, and since the amount of direct-reacting bilirubin was calculated from data obtained by putting standards through the total bilirubin procedure this could cause misleading results. Secondly, ascorbic acid and diazo reagent react to form a coloured product in the direct reaction. They were not present in the blank...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Oxidative {{stress is}} a central {{pathogenic}} mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD), and the heme oxygenase (HO) bilirubin pathway {{is one of the}} main mammalian antioxidative defences. Indeed, there is growing evidence of HO-bilirubin upregulation from early phases of PD. Our aim was to investigate bilirubin as a possible biomarker of PD diagnosis and progression. Methods: A cross-sectional case-control study was performed to evaluate differences in bilirubin levels between newly diagnosed, drug-naïve PD subjects and controls. Afterwards, PD subjects were included in a 2 -year longitudinal study to evaluate disease progression in relation to baseline bilirubin levels. Results: Seventy-five de novo PD subjects were selected and matched with 75 controls by propensity score. Analysis of variance showed higher bilirubin levels in PD patients compared with controls (P < 0. 001). Linear regression analysis failed to show a relationship between bilirubin and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (P = 0. 283) at baseline evaluation. At 2 -year follow-up, <b>indirect</b> relationships between <b>bilirubin</b> levels and UPDRS part III (P = 0. 028) and between bilirubin levels and levodopa-equivalent daily dosage (P = 0. 012) were found. Conclusions: Parkinson's disease subjects showed higher levels of bilirubin compared with controls. Bilirubin increase might be due to HO overexpression as a compensatory response to oxidative stress occurring from early stages of P...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the UGT 1 A 1 * 6 (G 71 R) and UGT 1 A 1 * 28 (promoter (TA) 7 -repeat) genotypes and hyperbilirubinaemia in Thai patients treated with indinavir, and characterize the inhibition of human UGTs by indinavir in vitro. METHODS: Ninety-six Thai HIV patients receiving indinavir, 800 mg t. i. d. or 800 mg b. i. d. "boosted" with ritonavir (100 mg b. i. d.), had serum bilirubin levels measured to 24 weeks post-treatment and were genotyped for UGT 1 A 1 * 6 and UGT 1 A 1 * 28. The inhibition selectivity and kinetics of indinavir were determined using a panel of recombinant human UGTs. RESULTS: UGT 1 A 1 * 6 and UGT 1 A 1 * 28 frequencies in the Thai patients were 10. 4 % and 15. 6 %, respectively. Total, conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (<b>indirect)</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> concentrations increased significantly at 24 weeks of indinavir treatment for all four genotypes, with a trend towards higher levels depending {{on the number of}} UGT 1 A 1 mutant alleles; * 6 /* 28 > * 6 > * 28 > reference. The hazards ratio (HR) for serious hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin > 2. 5 mg/dl) at week 24 was statistically significant only in those patients carrying the UGT 1 A 1 * 6 (HR 2. 87) and UGT 1 A 1 * 6 /* 28 (HR 11. 42) genotypes. The Ki values for indinavir inhibition of UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 1 * 6 were 4. 1 and 10. 7 mumol/l respectively. However, indinavir was also shown to inhibit other human UGTs, notably UGT 1 A 3 and UGT 1 A 7. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Caucasian HIV-infected patients treated with indinavir, the promoter polymorphism (UGT 1 A 1 * 28) is of less significance than the coding region (UGT 1 A 1 * 6) mutation as a risk factor for hyperbilirubinaemia. The Ki values determined for indinavir inhibition of UGT 1 A 1 are consistent with an interaction in vivo, with an additive effect in patients with already impaired bilirubin glucuronidation activit...|$|R
