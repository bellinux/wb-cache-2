40|$|Violacein, a pigment {{isolated}} from Chro-mobacterium violaceum in the Amazon River, presents diverse biologic proper-ties and attracts interest as a conse-quence of its antileukemic activity. Eluci-dation of the molecular mechanism mediating this activity will provide <b>further</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> for understanding {{its effects on}} the cellular physiology of untransformed cells and for considering its possible clinical application. Here, we show that violacein causes apoptosis in HL 60 leukemic cells but is ineffective in this respect in other types of leukemia cells or in normal human lymphocytes and monocytes. Violacein cytotoxicity in HL 60 cells was preceded by activation of caspase 8, transcription of nuclear factor B (NF-B) target genes, and p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Thus, violacein effects resemble tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) signal transduc-tion in these cells. Accordingly, inflix-imab, an antibody that antagonizes TNF-–induced signaling abolished the biologic activity of violacein. Moreover, violacein directly activated TNF receptor 1 signaling, because a violacein-depen-dent association of TNF receptor-associ-ated factor 2 (TRAF 2) to this TNF receptor was observed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Hence, violacein represents {{the first member of}} a novel class of cyto-toxic drugs mediating apoptosis of HL 60 cells by way of the specific activation of TN...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInsulin degludec (IDeg) {{is a novel}} antiglycemic agent {{belonging}} to the therapeutic class of ultra-long duration basal insulin analogs. Its half-life and duration of action are 25 hours and 42 hours, respectively.

According to the literature, IDeg provides glycemic control and nocturnal hypoglycemia reduction comparable with other long-acting analogs in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes seems also to be reduced when using IDeg therapy; however, long-term follow-up is warranted for monitoring of possible but relatively infrequent adverse events.

We have investigated how to develop a functional, automatic system based on this to detect heart rate. We have also investigated {{how to use the}} concept of non-contact PPG to acquire <b>further</b> <b>relevant</b> medical <b>information</b> from a human subject. Abstract We have investigated different color spaces and found that the Hue and Saturation channels from HSL and HSV color spaces are far superior to the Green channel of the RGB color space, which has previously been used. Especially under circumstances with much noise, are these channels superior and more robust against noise. Abstract The concept of independent component analysis (ICA) has been investigated as a method of improving results. It is found to improve some channels and color spaces, but the best ICA channel does not have better performance than the best non-ICA channel. Abstract The phase of, and difference between, PPG signals has been investigated as a means of acquiring medical information. The phase measurements are highly vulnerable to noise, but there are indications that occlusion can induce a phase difference between different limbs. This difference can be used to calculate change in blood pressure. Abstract We have synchronized ECG and PPG data, and found that there is a high correlation between the two. Pulse transit time (PTT) from the heart to the measurement site can be calculated using this synchronized information.

Knowledge {{of the state of}} the skeleton in these disorders is therefore desirable since patient management will largely depend on the early detection of bony deposits. Primary bone disease often spreads to soft tissue (lungs), and the early detection of this may alter significantly the therapeutic approach to the primary lesion.

40|$|Avian {{chemical}} communication is a rapidly emerging field, {{but has been}} hampered by a critical lack of information on volatile chemicals that communicate ecologically relevant information (semiochemicals). A possible, but as yet unexplored, function of olfaction and {{chemical communication}} in birds is in parent-embryo and embryo-embryo communication. Communication between parents and developing embryos may act to mediate parental behaviour, while communication between embryos can control the synchronicity of hatching. Embryonic vocalisations and vibrations have been implicated {{as a means of}} communication during the later stages of development but in the early stages, before embryos are capable of independent movement and vocalisation, this is not possible. Here we show that volatiles emitted from developing eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) convey information on egg fertility, along with the sex and developmental status of the embryo. Specifically, egg volatiles changed over the course of incubation, differed between fertile and infertile eggs, and were predictive of embryo sex as early as day 1 of incubation. Egg odours therefore have the potential to facilitate parent-embryo and embryo-embryo interactions by allowing the assessment of key measures of embryonic development long before this is possible through other modalities. It also opens up the intriguing possibility that parents may be able to glean <b>further</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> from egg volatiles, such as the health, viability and heritage of embryos.

40|$|Showy {{ornaments}} {{are considered}} as outcomes of sexual selection processes. They provide {{a badge of}} status to impress conspecific rivals or potential mating partners. Single ornaments may signal attractiveness or individual quality, yet many species display multiple ornaments. There are several hypotheses that explain the existence of multiple ornaments, suggesting that different ornaments serve as different information sources. They may provide either additive or redundant information on the same quality traits, or are simply evolutionary leftovers with no <b>further</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> Although females of many species display elaborated traits, most studies regarding multiple ornaments focus on males. However, given that in many species females also display multiple ornaments, the question about their functional significance arises. To understand the existence of female multiple ornaments we investigated ornamental features of female Superb Fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus), focusing on song and variation in plumage characteristics. Female Superb Fairy-wrens produce complex solo songs, for territorial defense, and have bright blue tail feathers. We examined the relationships between song and plumage coloration characteristics in relation to female quality parameters to investigate whether, {{and to what extent}} existing hypotheses on multiple ornaments in males may also apply to females. Based on song recordings and spectrometric measurements of UV-coloration of tail feathers, we derived a series of different song and plumage parameters. Our results indicate interrelationships between the song length (total number of elements in female song) and female body size, but not UV-coloration. Interestingly, song complexity (number of different elements in female song) did not correlate with morphological parameters, UV-Chroma and song length respectively. This suggests that i) song and plumage characteristics evolved independently and ii) even within one trait, namely song, multiple signalling should be considered. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating multiple traits in female songbirds, raising the idea that multiple signalling of sexually selected traits is not restricted to males only...|$|E
40|$|The University of Queensland (UQ) {{maintains}} an online research profiling system, UQ Researchers, to showcase {{the expertise of}} its academic staff and postgraduate students. The site makes available detailed research profiles and evidence of expertise at various levels. It incorporates school, institute and centre research profiles, CV-type profiles for individual researchers, research project and publication details, and details of available research facilities. External users can search for topical areas and seek opportunities for research collaboration. The service is often used internationally by aspiring research higher degree students who are seeking to identify institutions or individual academics with research strength in their chosen area of study. The UQ Researchers site provides access {{not only to the}} expertise and experience of individual researchers but also to that of research groups across the University. Participation in the service is currently optional. There is no mandate for inclusion. UQ Researchers offers direct data entry, as well as a data sourcing system that automatically collects information about academics and students, and their research, from UQ sources and provides it for use. Users are also welcome to add <b>further,</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> such as details of non-refereed publications, the collection of which is not currently done by UQ data sources. The take up of the UQ Researchers service, however, is patchy. Not all staff participate in the service, and postgraduate student take up is extremely low. This has been attributed to a number of causes, such as lack of time, lack of currency of the information provided, and reluctance on the part of staff to do direct data entry into the system. On the other hand, some staff and students were more than willing to spend time showcasing themselves and their work via social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. Accordingly, it was decided to compare the functionality of a social networking service with that of UQ Researchers to identify any gaps in the UQ research profiling service and to arrive at some recommendations for improving it...|$|E
40|$|The {{large volume}} of online and offline {{information}} that is available today has overwhelmed users’ efficiency and effectiveness in processing this information in order to extract <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> The exponential growth {{of the volume of}} Internet information complicates information access. Thus, it is a very time consuming and complex task for user in accessing <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> Information retrieval (IR) is a branch of artificial intelligence that tackles the problem of accessing and retrieving <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> The aim of IR is to enable the available data source to be queried for <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> efficiently and effectively. This paper describes a robust information retrieval framework {{that can be used to}} retrieve <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> The proposed information retrieval framework is designed to assist users in accessing <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> effectively and efficiently as it handles queries based on user preferences. Each component and module involved in the proposed framework will be explained in terms of functionality and the processes involved...|$|R
40|$|Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) {{is known}} to be a {{possible}} diagnosis tool for many cardiac applications as the detection and monitoring of some important vital parameters (Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability, Pulse Wave Velocity) in a non-contact and non-intrusive way. The technique has become known as Optical Vibrocardiography (VCG) i. e. by measuring the vibrations on the carotid artery or on the thorax [1 - 5]. The aim of the present study is to interpret the vibrational signal acquired from the carotid artery in relation to the electrocardiographic and hemodynamic aspects and to enable the extraction of <b>further</b> medical <b>information</b> <b>relevant</b> for diagnosis purpose. For the investigation an infrared (IR) Laser Doppler Vibrometer has been used. The acquired VCG signals have been processed and compared with the simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram and the color-coded Doppler sonogram. This has enabled {{a deeper understanding of the}} signature of the vibrational signal. Furthermore, in this paper, we also discuss the medical value of the VCG signal obtained from the carotid artery...|$|R
40|$|Theories on visual change {{detection}} {{imply that}} attention {{is a necessary}} but not sufficient prerequisite for aware perception. Misguidance of attention due to salient irrelevant distractors can therefore lead to severe deficits in change detection. The present study investigates the mechanisms behind such perceptual errors and their relation to error processing on higher cognitive levels. Participants had to detect a luminance change that occasionally occurred simultaneously with an irrelevant orientation change in the opposite hemi-field (conflict condition). By analyzing event-related potentials in the EEG separately in those error prone conflict trials for correct and erroneous change detection, we demonstrate that only correct change detection {{was associated with the}} allocation of attention to the relevant luminance change. Erroneous change detection was associated with an initial capture of attention toward the irrelevant orientation change in the N 1 time window and a lack of subsequent target selection processes (N 2 pc). Errors were additionally accompanied by an increase of the fronto-central N 2 and a kind of error negativity (Ne or ERN), which, however, peaked prior to the response. These results suggest that a strong perceptual conflict by salient distractors can disrupt the <b>further</b> processing of <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> and thus affect its aware perception. Yet, it does not impair higher cognitive processes for conflict and error detection, indicating that these processes are independent from awareness...|$|R
