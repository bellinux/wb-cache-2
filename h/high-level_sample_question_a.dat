3000|$|In many cases, as {{mentioned}} in section [...] "Typical pressure and temperature profiles", the initial {{pressure in the}} chamber exceeded the maximum pressure at the RGA. As such, {{it was necessary to}} wait until the pressure had declined sufficiently before beginning the illumination. This process took from a few hours to 5 days depending upon the particular <b>sample</b> in <b>question.</b> <b>As</b> a result there is an initial large jump in pressure which often shows up as a large jump in the D/H ratio within the first five days of each run that corresponds to this event, such as just before day 5 in panel B, day 2 in panel D, day 1 in panel E, day 2 in panel F and day 1 in panel G. A clear jump due to this effect cannot be discerned in panel A, and panel C represents a continuation of panel B--therefore {{it is fair to say}} that the jump occurs between the two runs.

40|$|We study high-dimensional {{distribution}} {{learning in}} an agnostic setting where an adversary {{is allowed to}} arbitrarily corrupt an ε-fraction of the <b>samples.</b> Such <b>questions</b> have <b>a</b> rich history spanning statistics, machine learning and theoretical computer science. Even in the most basic settings, the only known approaches are either computationally inefficient or lose dimension-dependent factors in their error guarantees. This raises the following question:Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even possible, algorithmically? In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms with dimension-independent error guarantees for agnostically learning several fundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian, (2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product distributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of spherical Gaussians. Our algorithms achieve error that is independent of the dimension, {{and in many cases}} scales nearly-linearly with the fraction of adversarially corrupted samples. Moreover, we develop a general recipe for detecting and correcting corruptions in high-dimensions, that may be applicable to many other problems...|$|R

This authoring tool is designed primarily to develop question answering characters. The focus is to deliver an appropriate answer for <b>a</b> user’s <b>question.</b> An author creates a response handling strategy by populating a language database with specific answers to <b>sample</b> <b>questions</b> and assigning these answers to an individual character. Different characters may have different knowledge about an event and respond differently to the same <b>question.</b> At run-time, <b>a</b> statement manager matches <b>a</b> user’s <b>question</b> to <b>an</b> answer of an associated non player character. NPCEditor has been evaluated and is an effective and versatile system in applications for virtual <b>question</b> answering characters. <b>As</b> future work, the autors mention dialogue management as a specialized component.|$|R

40|$|Assessing the {{precision}} of volume estimates from systematic <b>samples</b> is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of great practical importance, but statistically a challenging task due to the strong spatial dependence of the data and typically small sample sizes. The approach taken in this paper is more ambitious than earlier methodologies, the goal of which was estimation of the variance of a volume estimator v̂, rather than estimation {{of the distribution of}} v̂. We shall show that bootstrap methods yield consistent estimators of the distribution of v̂, and also suggest a variety of confidence intervals for the true volume. Our new methodology covers cases where serial sections are exactly periodic, as well as instances where the physical slicing procedure introduces errors in the placement of the sampling points. Measurement errors within sections are also taken into account. The performance of the method is illustrated by a simulation study with synthetic data, and also applied to real datasets.

40|$|The {{thermometry}} {{precision of}} <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of both fundamental and technological importance. In this paper, we consider a ring-structure system as our probe {{to estimate the}} temperature of a bath. Based on the Markovian master equation of the probe, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the probe at any time. We find that for the thermal equilibrium thermometry, the ferromagnetic structure can measure a lower temperature of the bath with a higher precision compared with the non-structure probe. While for the dynamical thermometry, the antiferromagnetic structure can make the QFI of the probe in the dynamical process much larger than that in equilibrium with the bath, which is somewhat counterintuitive. Moreover, the best accuracy for the thermometry achieved in the antiferromagnetic structure case can be much higher than that in the non-structure case. The physical mechanisms of above phenomena are given in this paper. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

30|$|We {{adopted a}} one-factor repeated-measures {{approach}} in our experimental design, {{which has been}} shown to demonstrate a greater precision than designs that employ only between-subjects factors [40]. Each subject used the Authorship Portal to answer two sections of questions and then provide ratings on a number of statements and their demographic data in a third section. In one of the first two sections, the participant used the portal’s visualization functionality to answer the questions while in the other section the participant did not use the functionality. The subject used the portal to answer two or three questions in the section’s three parts. When allowed to use the portal’s visualization feature, the participant would {{be able to use the}} portal’s feature highlighting, authorship comparison spider chart, and stylometric heatmap in the section’s three parts respectively. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>question</b> in Part 1 is “How many times do “Opinions and Attitudes” words appear in the message?” <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>question</b> in Part 2 is “Between BintMuhammad and Raihan, which author has a higher usage of affect words?” <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>question</b> in Part 3 is “Which author has the highest usage of “Politics and Events” content in their authoring of forum messages?” Two different sets of questions were used in the two sections.|$|R
