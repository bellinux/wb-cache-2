50|$|Semi-killed {{steel is}} mostly <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steel,</b> but the carbon {{monoxide}} leaves blowhole type porosity {{distributed throughout the}} ingot. The porosity eliminates the pipe found in killed steel and increases the yield to approximately 90% by weight. Semi-killed steel is commonly used for structural steel with a carbon content between 0.15 and 0.25% carbon, because it is rolled, which closes the porosity. It is also used for drawing applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deoxidized</b> <b>steel</b> is steel {{that has}} {{some or all of}} the oxygen removed from the melt during the {{steelmaking}} process. Liquid steels contain dissolved oxygen after their conversion from molten iron, but the solubility of oxygen in steel decreases with cooling. As steel cools, excess oxygen can cause blowholes or precipitate FeO. Therefore, several strategies have been developed for deoxidation. This may be accomplished by adding metallic deoxidizing agents to the melt either before or after it is tapped, or by vacuum treatment, in which carbon dissolved in the steel is the deoxidizer.|$|E

There is, however, few reports about the current flow in the closed circuit of tool-workpiece-machine on the behavior of deposited layer called "belag" observed in machining workmaterials such as calcium <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steel</b> and BN added steel and so on. This paper deals with the machinability of steels in turning with additional current. Tested workmaterials were plane carbon steel JIS S 45 C and BN added steel which has good machinability at high cutting speed. Turning tests were performed by carbide tool P 30 in order to investigate the influence of electrical conditions of closed circuit system on the cutting mechanism of BN added steel. The tool life, cutting force, chip geometries and others were investigated practically and these results were discussed. [議事録...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{intragranular}} ferrite nucleation by specific inclusions {{is well known}} from steel weld metals. In this paper it is shown that the idea can be transferred to steel metallurgy. Control of the inclusion composition and thus the nucleation potency with respect to ferrite can readily be achieved by the choice of an appropriate deoxidation procedure. Thermodynamic (Thermo-Calc) calculations in addition to X-ray mappings and microprobe analysis are employed to understand and predict the inclusion formation in the steels. Three different steels, two of them Ti-deoxidized, and one Al-Ca-deoxidized, {{have been subjected to}} weld thermal simulation at different peak temperatures and cooling programs followed by Charpy-V notch testing at {minus} 40 C to reveal differences in the HAZ toughness. The results from these tests show that the titanium <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steels</b> exhibit excellent toughness in the grain coarsened HAZ after high heat input weld simulation because of a refinement of the microstructure. This observation is in contrast to the more traditional behavior of the conventional Al-Ca <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steels,</b> which show no evidence of intragranular ferrite formation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ：High {{temperature}} confocal laser microscope, FE-SEM-EDS and EPMA {{were utilized}} {{to study the}} Ti-Mn-Al-Si-O-S complex inclusion inducing IAF in Ti <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steel.</b> FactStage was also {{used to calculate the}} thermodynamics of inclusion formation. It was demonstrated that when the cooling rate is fixed to 5 ˚C/s, IAF can be induced by complex inclusions which act as the core of IAF at 609 ˚C. Microstructure of the complex inclusions is complicated. These inclusions are consisted of the TiOx-MnO core which is surrounded by MnO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 complex inclusions and small amount of MnS. The reason that Ti-Mn-Al-Si-O-S complex inclusions can induce IAF is that a Mn-depleted zone is formed by the core TiOx-MnO and the MnS around it. Meanwhile, the difference between MnO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 and austenite thermal expansion coefficients is tremendous is another principle element for the IAF formation. Instruction It has been reported that in oxide metallurgy the inclusions is steel can be used to induce intragranular ferrite (IAF) to refine the microstructure of steel, known as oxide metallurgy.

50|$|Ferrosilicon {{is used as}} {{a source}} of silicon to reduce metals from their oxides and to <b>deoxidize</b> <b>steel</b> and other ferrous alloys. This {{prevents}} the loss of carbon from the molten steel (so called blocking the heat); ferromanganese, spiegeleisen, silicides of calcium, and many other materials are used for the same purpose. It {{can be used to make}} other ferroalloys. Ferrosilicon is also used for manufacture of silicon, corrosion-resistant and high-temperature resistant ferrous silicon alloys, and silicon steel for electromotors and transformer cores. In the manufacture of cast iron, ferrosilicon is used for inoculation of the iron to accelerate graphitization. In arc welding, ferrosilicon can be found in some electrode coatings.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} electron microscopical {{investigation of}} three Ti-Nb Al <b>deoxidized</b> <b>steels</b> with different N:Ti ratios has been undertaken. In each steel, {{a large number}} of small (< 10 nm) particles were observed. Parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS) showed that their compositions in the three steels were consistent with those reported for the caps on the TiN cores in the equivalent steels in Part I, i. e. NbC 0. 7 N 0. 3, NbC and (Nb 0. 7 Ti 0. 3) C, respectively. The Nb incorporated in these caps added to that dissolved in the TiN cores results in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} small particles which give effective dispersion hardening. The size of this reduction depends on a number of competing factors. AlN precipitation also occurred in the as-rolled steel with highest N content and in the normalized steels with the two higher N contents. AlN is usually expected to control the austenite grain growth. NbC-based material grew on the AlN.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of nonmetallic inclusions is {{of importance for}} the production of clean steel in order to improve the mechanical properties. In this respect, a three-dimensional (3 D) investigation is considered to be useful for an accurate evaluation of size, number, morphology of inclusions, and elementary distribution in each inclusion particle. In this study, the application of various extraction methods (chemical extraction/etching by acid or halogen-alcohol solutions, electrolysis, sputtering with glow discharge, and so on) for 3 D estimation of nonmetallic Al 2 O 3 inclusions and clusters in high-alloyed steels was examined and discussed using an Fe- 10 mass% Ni alloy and an 18 / 8 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>deoxidized</b> with Al.

40|$|DoctorTitanium {{is added}} in many grade steels as an {{alloying}} element to improve mechanical properties via the grain refinement during hot rolling. Also, Ti {{is an important}} alloying element in stainless steels to stabilize C and N, and hence to improve the inter-granular corrosion resistance of the weld. Meanwhile, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The selenium added steels have been concerned to replace the conventionally lead added machinability steels because of environmental friendliness. Since the yield of Se addition into liquid steel is quite low due to its high vapor pressure at steelmaking temperatures, the improvement of Se yield becomes essential for its successful application to plant. In this thesis, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions resulting in the nozzle clogging and increase the Ti yield, the effect of Ti addition between melt and refractory will be investigated. In case of Se, thermodynamics {{on the behavior of}} selenium based on dissolution reactions in liquid iron as well as selenium-containing slags will be investigated as well. In chapter II, the thermodynamic role of Ti in steels and the effect of Ca and Ti addition to the molten stainless <b>steel</b> <b>deoxidized</b> with Al on the formation of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusions were investigated. High melting point inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) are known to promote clogging of the SEN nozzle in a continuous caster mold. In particular, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The sequence of Ca and Ti additions after Al deoxidation was also investigated. The inclusion chemistry and morphology according to the order of Ca and Ti are discussed from the standpoint of spinel formation. The thermodynamic interaction parameter of Mg with respect to the Ti alloying element was determined. The element of Ti in steels could contribute to enhancing the spinel formation, because Ti accelerates Mg dissolution from the MgO containing refractory walls or slags due to its high thermodynamic affinity for Mg. Even though Ti induces also Ca dissolution from the CaO containing refractory walls or slags owing to its thermodynamic affinity for Ca, dissolved Ca plays a role in favoring the formation of calcium aluminate inclusions, which are more stable thermodynamically in an Al deoxized steel. The inclusion content of steel samples was analyzed to better understand fundamentals of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusion formation. The optimum processing conditions for Ca treatment and Ti addition in austenitic stainless steel melts to achieve the minimized spinel formation and the maximized Ti alloying yield is discussed. In chapter III, the standard free energy change of the dissolution reaction of Se vapor in liquid iron at steelmaking temperatures was determined. The Henrian activity constant of Se in Fe-Se system at 1873 K was also assessed. The self interaction parameter of Se was obtained as - 0. 045 by assuming the regular solution model in Fe-Se system using the values of the Gibbs free energy and the Herian constant. The interaction parameters between Se and second element i such as O, Cr, Ni, Mn, N, Mo, Si, Al, S, Bi and Te were also determined. The solute elements of O, Ni, Cr and Mn significantly increase the selenium solubility in liquid iron. The determined interaction parameters between Se and second elements in liquid iron at 1873 K will be addressed in terms of the economical and feasible ways of Se addition as well as the improvement of machinability owing to MnSe formation during the solidification stage. Using these values of interaction parameters, the further studies employing the refining slags and melt equilibrium reaction system need to be done to address a feasible processing way to produce an environmentally friendly free-cutting steels. However, there has not been much research on these slags system for optimization of the behavior of Se. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the processing methods to increase Se yield in steels enough to complete against the production cost of Pb containing steel grade. In order to increase the Se yield, the slag system of CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO relevant to refining Se-containing steels such as free cutting steel is thermodynamically assessed at 1873 K. The distribution ratio of Se has been determined in slag/melt system. Selenium capacity due to the basicity and oxygen potential was also researched. Besides, the effect of substitution of each slag component on the selenium capacity and the relationship between optical basicity and selenium capacity were researched as well. This thermodynamic assessment can be performed to understand the behavior of Se in slag/metal system and get the data of optimization for these slag systems. In chapter IV, based on the results from chapter II and III, this thesis suggested an application method of the present results to actual refining processes, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) as well as increase Se contents in steel melt...|$|R
