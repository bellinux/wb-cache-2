50|$|This {{parasite}} {{has been}} reported to infect the grey necked wood rail (Aramides cajaneus) and the <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus fuscater).|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> {{is common}} {{in a variety of}} {{habitats}} throughout its wide range and has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The species readily adapts to anthropogenic disturbances and can make use of urban, deforested or agricultural areas.|$|E
500|$|... in <b>Great</b> Britain song <b>thrushes</b> are {{commonly}} found {{where there are}} trees and bushes. Such areas include parks, gardens, coniferous and deciduous woodland and hedgerows.|$|R
50|$|With such an {{abundance}} of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle thrushes, tawny owls, song <b>thrushes,</b> <b>great</b> spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches.|$|R
60|$|And at last, {{after months}} of labor, the boat was finished. Oh, the deportment of Peter {{as he saw it}} growing more and more like a <b>great</b> <b>thrush's</b> nest! From the very {{beginning}} of the building of it he slept by its side, and often woke up to say sweet things to it, and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it. He sleeps in his nest still, and has a fascinating way of curling round in it, for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten. It is brown inside, of course, but outside it is mostly green, being woven of grass and twigs, and when these wither or snap the walls are thatched afresh. There are also a few feathers here and there, which came off the thrushes while they were building.|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> is a generalist feeder, principally {{foraging}} for {{fruits and}} berries but also taking invertebrates and even stealing eggs and nestlings. It tends to swallow fruits whole. It generally feeds on ground level, preferentially in short grass, but also visits fruiting trees and shrubs. Activity peaks are at dawn and dusk. When flushed, flight distance is usually short.|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus fuscater) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Turdidae. It is found in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. It is {{considered}} as the largest thrush in South America. The great thrush's size distinguishes it from the several other uniform slaty-colored thrushes in its range. It inhabits subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and high-altitude shrubland, but can also make use of degraded forest and urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The song {{of these}} birds is a {{pleasant}} wheee-whee-whee-whee-wheet, but the Pacific cacique has a descending melancholy wheeo-wheeo-wheeo-wheeo. The calls birds give to members differ {{between the three}} groups: those of the subtropical cacique sound rather atypical for icterids and more like the chatter of an excited <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus fuscater). The scarlet-rumped cacique in the narrowest sense has a burry pleeo; the Pacific cacique has a sweeter keeo or a shree.|$|E
50|$|This walk-though aviary {{features}} {{a collection of}} 600 birds representing 80 species indigenous to Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Ground dwelling birds including pheasants, partridges, pigeons and <b>thrushes.</b> <b>Great</b> argus pheasants proclaim their presence by ringing territorial calls and give {{one of the most}} elaborate courtship displays in the bird world.|$|R
50|$|Edgwarebury Park is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation, {{its most}} {{distinctive}} feature being its magnificent old hedgerows. Fine old oak and ash trees tower over the bushes, {{and the wild}} service-tree is {{an indicator of the}} hedgerows' antiquity. The park is an excellent site for birdwatching. Species include song <b>thrush,</b> mistle <b>thrush,</b> <b>great</b> spotted woodpecker and whitethroat.|$|R
50|$|The grounds also {{qualify as}} a Local Biodiversity Site (LBS). The Scottish Ornithologists Club (SOC) have {{identified}} Spier's as a site for birdwatching with, amongst others, tits, finches, <b>thrushes,</b> <b>greater</b> spotted woodpecker, chiffchaff, blackcap, willow and garden warbler. An unusual bird migrant record for the school grounds in the 1920s {{is that of the}} mealy redpoll (Carduelis flammea flammea). It breeds across the northern parts of North America and Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> {{makes use}} {{of a variety of}} habitats, {{including}} open forest, backyards, parks, and even farmland with scattered trees or forest remnants. It also occurs at the edges of different classes of Andean forests, including humid montane, secondary and temperate forests. It {{is more likely to be}} found at altitudes above 2000 m. The species tends to avoid dry conditions and densely forested areas, but sometimes occurs on the edges of Andean p√°ramo or in shrublands. It commonly inhabits urban habitats in the highlands, e.g. in Quito and Bogota. Populations are generally sedentary.|$|E
50|$|Thrushes are plump, soft-plumaged, {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} birds, inhabiting wooded areas, and often {{feed on the}} ground. The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and 14.5 cm. However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The <b>great</b> <b>thrush</b> is similar in length, but less heavily built. Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.|$|E
