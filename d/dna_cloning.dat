For the <b>DNA</b> <b>clone</b> of this variant, among 65 colonies of E. coli tested by PCR, 17 were positive for the virus, and 5 had correct predicted EcoRI pattern for full DNA copy of the variant genome. On the contrary, for <b>DNA</b> <b>clone</b> GVB 953 - 1, testing of total 229 E. coli colonies, 28 were found virus-positive in PCR, and only 4 had the correct, predicted XbaI pattern of the full DNA copy of the variant. Purified plasmids containing full DNA copies of GVA P 163 -M 5 and GVB 953 - 1, respectively, under Ca 35 S promoter were combined and transformed to A. tumefaciens C 58.C 1. Fourteen PCR virus-positive colonies of each virus were selected for agroinoculation of N. benthamiana. Of these, 8 <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> of GVA P 163 -M 5 and none of GVB 953 - 1 were infectious to N. benthamiana. To uncover {{the reason for the}} lack of infectivity of <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> of GVB 953 - 1, the mixture of the full DNA copies of this virus under Ca 35 S promoter released from pGEM-T vector, used earlier in cloning to pCAMBIA 1305.1, stored in − 30  °C, was used to clone the virus to pCB.LB. 35 ST-NosT.RB. The same was done with a similar mixture of the full DNA copies of GVA P 163 -M 5. For each virus, among 10 randomly selected E. coli colonies which were PCR positive for virus sequences, 6 and 8 colonies contained full DNA copies of GVA P 163 -M 5 and GVB 953 - 1, respectively. Plasmids with full DNA copies of viruses under Ca 35 S promoter were mixed and transformed to A. tumefaciens C 58.C 1. Brief PCR testing of respectively 4 and 25 A. tumefaciens colonies, 2 and 5 were virus-positive. The positive clones were used to agroinoculate N. benthamiana. Of these, 2 <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> of GVA P 163 -M 5 and 4 <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> of GVB 953 - 1 were infectious. These results suggest that the lack of infectivity of <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> of GVB 953 - 1 variant in pCAMBIA 1305.1 observed earlier, was caused not by lethal mutations, which could be introduced to virus genome in RT-PCR or toxicity of the variant to E. coli, but was apparently caused by instability of the DNA copy of this variant under Ca 35 S promoter in this binary vector. The relatively easy <b>cloning</b> of infectious <b>DNA</b> copies of both GVA and GVB to pCB.LB. 35 ST-NosT.RB, suggest that this binary vector is superior to pCAMBIA 1305.1 in cloning of the full cDNA copies of members of the Vitivirus genus.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is {{believed}} to be the primary causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). It is supposed that capsid protein of PCV may contribute to replication control via interaction between Cap and Rep in the nucleoplasm. In this study, we described the construction and in vitro characterization of NLS-exchanged PCV <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> based on a PMWS-associated PCV 2 b isolate from China to determine the role of ORF 2 NLS in PCV replication. Results The PCV 1, PCV 2, PCV 2 -NLS 1 and PCV 1 -NLS 2 <b>DNA</b> <b>clone</b> were generated by ligating a copy of respective genome in tandem with a partial duplication. The PCV 2 -NLS 1 and PCV 1 -NLS 2 <b>DNA</b> <b>clone</b> contained a chimeric genome in which the ORF 2 NLS was exchanged. The four <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> were all confirmed to be infectious in vitro when transfected into PK- 15 cells, as PCV capsid protein were expressed in approximately 10 - 20 % of the transfected cells. The in vitro growth characteristics of the <b>DNA</b> <b>clones</b> were then determined and compared. All the recovered progeny viruses gave rise to increasing infectious titers during passages and were genetically stable by genomic sequencing. The chimeric PCV 1 -NLS 2 and PCV 2 -NLS 1 viruses had the final titers of about 10 4. 2 and 10 3. 8 TCID 50 /ml, which were significantly lower than that of PCV 1 and PCV 2 (10 5. 6 and 10 5. 0 TCID 50 /ml, respectively). When the ORF 2 NLS exchanged, the mutant PCV 2 (PCV 2 -NLS 1) still replicated less efficiently and showed lower infectious titer than did PCV 1 mutant (PCV 1 -NLS 2), which was consistent with the distinction between wild type PCV 1 and PCV 2. Conclusions Recovery of the chimeiric PCV 1 -NLS 2 and PCV 2 -NLS 1 progeny viruses indicate that the nuclear localization signal sequence of capsid protein are functionally exchangeable between PCV 1 and PCV 2 with respect to the role of nuclear importing and propagation. The findings also reveal that ORF 2 NLS play an accessory role in the replication of PCV. However, we found that ORF 2 NLS was not responsible for the distinction of in vitro growth characteristic between PCV 1 and PCV 2. Further studies are required to determine the in vivo viral replication and pathogenicity of the NLS chimeric <b>DNA</b> <b>clones.</b> </p...|$|R
