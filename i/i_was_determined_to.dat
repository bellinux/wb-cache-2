25|$|According to the {{historical}} sources there were three Bulgarian missions to the Pope with the participation of Peter, the first one being {{in the summer of}} 866. The interest of Boris I in the Roman Church was caused by the reluctance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to accept his request to appoint an independent patriarch (or at least an archbishop) for the Bulgarian diocese in order to retain it subordinated to Constantinople. Boris <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> make Bulgaria Christian while keeping the country's religious and political independence. Since the end of the 850s the churches of Rome and Constantinople were in a period of a heated competition for influence over the Slavs and the Ecumenical Church power. This rivalry favoured Boris' plans, as it gave him the opportunity to play one side off against the other and choose. The new orientation of the Bulgarian policy also allowed Boris I to calm down the nobility of the boyars, which was cautious and hostile to the increased Byzantine influence in the country after the Christianization.|$|E

Preferring to attend philosophical classes, Bourguiba sent his notes to his brother M'hamed and excelled in his studies.

Furthermore, he met, in the hospital, paranoias who thought they were Napoleon or other historical personalities.

[...] Rekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: [...] "I was called the ‘Ugly Duckling’ of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features.

He captained the scratch Australian Services cricket team which drew the Victory Tests 2–2 against England in 1945.

Keith Miller had been a young batsmen before the war better known for playing Australian rules {{football}} in his native Victoria.

He was the star of the Victory Tests, having decided that [...] "The people of England wanted an escape from the hellish suffering they had experienced for so many years. Those who turned up to watch cricket deserved something better than grim, unentertaining stonewalling, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> go for runs every time I went in to bat". He hit a swashbuckling 185 in 165 minutes for the Dominion XI vs England at Lords with seven towering sixes and became a cricketing star. Miller kept to this philosophy throughout his career, becoming one of the world's most entertaining strokemakers and a magnet for the crowds. Although an all-rounder Miller saw himself as a batsman first and batted in the top order throughout his career, though it suffered as he was often spent from bowling. Ron Hamence was the nearly man of the Australian team, he made his Test debut after his career best 145 vs the MCC and was stranded on 30 not out in their first innings collapse to Doug Wright. He played India in 1947–48 and toured England in 1948, but played only two more Tests as he could not force his way into the strong Australian team.|$|E
