5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin and the hair. All parts of the animal are used <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E

The plays built support among peasants steeped <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E

5|$|Engleromyces sinensis {{is used in}} China <b>in</b> <b>traditional</b> {{medicine}} for its antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties, and is sold in market stalls in Yunnan. Several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from the fungus. It produces engleromycin, a cytochalasin. This compound, which is also made by E.goetzii, has antibiotic and cytotoxic activity. Additional metabolites include the novel compound neoengleromycin, and the previously known cytochalasin D and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D. Neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine-substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton.|$|E
