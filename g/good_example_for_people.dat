40|$|The {{deference}} Islam civilization {{with other}} civilization is {{the attitude of}} tolerance to other religions. Tolerance {{which is part of}} the vision of theology or belief in Islam and it include in the framework of Islamic theology. it should be reviewed in depth and applied in the religious life because it is a social necessity for all religious communities and a way for the creation of harmony among faiths. Tolerant attitude is critical and this should not merely be a discourse, but it must be practiced in daily life - the day especially for a scholar. Rassulullah said “ The scholars is heir of the prophets (HR. Bukhari) ” As a heir of Prophets, Surely they should be able to set a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> in around them, as well as Islamic teachings when they deliver what they thought and it should be out of line with their life even explicitly said Allah : “Oh you who believe, not what you say you do not do hateful in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do (As- ShafF 2 - 3) ”. The author here will analyze Indonesia figure he is an Ulama and politician that is Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah or usually called by Hamka, which stands for name, (bom in rural villages Molek, Maninjau, West Sumatra, February 17 1908 - died in Jakarta, July 24 1981 at age 73 years). He was Indonesian writer, and scholar, and politicianl. the writer would like to discuss his interpretation about the tolerance of religion with his life practice to know about that author will explain the interpretation of hamka about verses of tolerance of religion than compare it with life history of hamka in the religious community and politic in Indonesia. Hamka was popular ulama in Indonesia beside an ulama he also politician an interpretator. one of books having composed by him is Tafsir al Azhar. Hamka very consistence between his interpretation and his life that having two dimension it is suit with his interpretation about tolerance of religion that only in the case of social interaction and not in creeds area. The Qura’n foundation that he use to interact to other religion is QS. Al-Mumtahina verse 7 - 9. And QS. AI-Kafirun verse 1 - 6. The hamka’s fatwa of prohibition to join Christmas was show his consistency because Christmas is the feast day of Christian that regard Isa as God not as a prophet as understandable by Moslem. to prevent blur of creeds, hamka as Chief of MUI issue that forbidden to Moslem join celebrate Christmas but this Fatwa rise many conflict until the ministry affair of religion Ratu Alamsyah ask to cancel it. But Hamka choose Resign as Chief Of MUI Than pull out his Fatwa. So it is very clear that hamka is ulama that we can use as example because he is very consistent in his life...|$|E

It is thus clear that it is possible to be a good citizen without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man." [...] Specifically, in his view, the good citizen is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one Greek word being translated [...] "good." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. It {{is common}} for Bertrand Russell’s admirers to repeat his many quips about other people’s lack of <b>good</b> sense, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> “most <b>people</b> would die sooner than think – in fact, they do so. ” 1 But it is less common for them to assert that this view is one of Russell’s {{fundamental}} assumptions about human nature and {{at the core of}} his serious moral, social, and political thought. This essay aims to show that this expressed scepticism about human reason is indeed a core assumption of Russell’s public philosophy throughout his life. Even if one accepts this, however, one can still ask: “But is it true?” It will be argued that there is much support for Russell’s view of human reason in recent psychological literature. Examples of how this assumption affects Russell’s social and political thought are indicated. 1. The complete and correct quote is “We all have a tendency to think that the world must conform to our prejudices. The opposite view involves some effort of thought, and most people would die sooner than think – in fact, they do so. ” (The ABC of Relativity, 1925...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It can be often {{observed}} in contingent valuation surveys that some respondents {{do not agree}} to pay some money for a public good, for reasons that differ from a genuine indifference to the <b>good.</b> <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> some <b>people</b> may dislike the idea of placing monetary values to public goods like the environment or a historical monument. Some may protest against the inefficiency of the public administration in managing public funds, and refuse to pay a tax. Others may behave strategically, if they think that their answer could influence the actual level of taxation. A good survey design can effectively reduce them, but protest votes can hardly be completely removed from the dataset. The {{question is how to}} deal with them. Sometimes they are considered as true zero values, or, if the dichotomous choice method is used, as if they were below the minimum bid. Obviously, if the unwillingness to pay reflects only a protest and not a low or null valuation of the good, this procedure results in downward biased estimates of the wtp measure. It is of paramount importance that the questionnaire contains a follow up question for individuals that refuse payment, to investigate about their motivations, and interpret the responses. Alternatively, observations with protest votes are simply cut off the sample, and only the subsample with positive reservation prices is considered in the analysis. This procedure will no...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the impacts of Bolivia’s non-contributory pension, the Renta Dignidad, on the wellbeing of older peasants and their families. Literature on social protection has {{had a tendency to}} propose social protection policies as contributing to a broad range of objectives, and non-contributory pensions are no exception. Studies have found them to contribute not only to ‘obvious’ needs such as increased consumption and income security but also to investments in productivity, social relationships, health, increased access to credit and savings, while it has become common to claim that they contribute to intangible goals such as dignity and citizenship. Moreover, because they do not impose conditionalities on recipients and are often relatively broader in their coverage than other social protection policies, social pensions have generally avoided critiques that have been aimed at conditional cash transfers and public works programmes. The danger of this literature is that it assumes that wellbeing is heavily responsive to monetary wealth, rather than other areas. To study this, an ethnographic methodology, based on participant observation and semi-structured interviews was employed in two rural communities located in the La Paz department in the highland Altiplano region of Bolivia close to Lake Titicaca. My analysis shows that older persons’ wellbeing depends heavily on a combination of elements, going beyond material wellbeing into areas such as their relationships with their spouses, children, grandchildren, and the other people in the rural communities in which they live, their ability to contribute their labour and maintain their daily (agricultural) work, to participate in collective social political and religious activities, and to maintain <b>good</b> health. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> older <b>people</b> work hard <b>for</b> as late in life as possible largely because it is meaningful for them to work the land and produce food. This means that health problems, which are often exacerbated by hard work, are particularly damaging to wellbeing because they inhibit older persons’ ability to do this. Meanwhile, ideas and values about how older people should live are continually being negotiated and contested between older people and with their younger family members, often leading to disputes. These are not driven solely by material interests, but concern the ways in which people should live and seek cultural, social and spiritual fulfilment. This is not due to a particular conception of wellbeing held by these people because they are indigenous, as might be inferred through the romantic lens of the vivir bien concept, but because human wellbeing more generally needs to be understood in relational terms, rather than exclusively in terms of peoples’ capacity to satisfy their basic needs. While the Renta Dignidad increases older persons’ ability to consume, maintain livelihood security, and in some case to participate in exchanges of food and gifts with other family members, it does not respond significantly to these other areas of wellbeing, contributing little to healthcare <b>for</b> <b>example.</b> The policy implications of this are that a more integral approach needs to be adopted to older persons’ wellbeing, going beyond cash transfers to greater efforts to bring healthcare services to older people in remote rural areas...|$|R
