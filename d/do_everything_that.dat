25|$|After 'having {{gotten the}} Jews of Palestine and of {{elsewhere}} to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> they could, personally and financially, to help Yishuv,' Ben-Gurion's second greatest achievement was his having successfully transformed Haganah {{from being a}} clandestine paramilitary organization into a true army. Ben-Gurion appointed Israel Galili {{to the position of}} head of the High Command counsel of Haganah and divided Haganah into 6 infantry brigades, numbered 1 to 6, allotting a precise theatre of operation to each one. Yaakov Dori was named Chief of Staff, but it was Yigael Yadin who assumed the responsibility on the ground as chief of Operations. Palmach, commanded by Yigal Allon, was divided into 3 elite brigades, numbered 10–12, and constituted the mobile force of Haganah. Ben-Gurion's attempts to retain personal control over the newly formed IDF lead later in July to The Generals' Revolt.|$|E
25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E
500|$|Charles I {{became the}} English monarch in 1625, and the {{situation}} grew worse for Puritans; an increased number of them moved to the Netherlands. [...] Charles tended to be inflexible, {{but he would not}} compromise with his rivals. [...] This resulted in Parliament becoming dominated by Puritans, followed by civil war in the 1640s. [...] Under Charles, the Anglican church reverted to more ceremonial worship, approaching that of Catholicism, and there was increased hostility towards the Calvinism that Cotton followed. [...] Cotton's colleagues were being summoned to the High Court for their Puritan practices, but he continued to thrive because of his supportive aldermen and sympathetic superiors, as well as his conciliatory demeanor. [...] Minister Samuel Ward of Ipswich remarked, [...] "Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton, of Boston, most; for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> way, and cannot enjoy mine." ...|$|E

In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard.

2500|$|Dogs used in law {{enforcement}} are trained to either be either [...] "single purpose" [...] or [...] "dual purpose". Single purpose dogs are used primarily for backup, personal protection, and tracking. Dual purpose dogs, however, are more commonly trained. Dual purpose dogs <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> single purpose dogs do, and also detect either explosives or narcotics, however, they cannot be trained to detect both. Dogs can only be trained for {{one or the other}} because the dog cannot communicate to the officer if it found explosives or narcotics. When a narcotics dog in the United States indicates to the officer that it found something, the officer has reasonable suspicion to search whatever the dog alerted on (i.e. bag or vehicle) without a warrant.|$|E

[...] When you’ve been doing what I have been doing for 5 decades plus, yes you’re gonna get critics. [...] People said, [...] "He’s going to fade away." [...] Well, how about fifty-two years.

2500|$|In December1941, Puyi {{followed}} Japan in declaring {{war on the}} United States and Great Britain, but as neither {{nation had}} recognized Manchukuo there were no reciprocal declarations of war in return. During the war, Puyi was an example and role model {{for at least some}} in Asia who believed in the Japanese Pan-Asian propaganda. U Saw, the Prime Minister of Burma, was secretly in communication with the Japanese, declaring that as an Asian his sympathies were completely with Japan against the West. USaw further added that he hoped that when Japan won the war that he would enjoy exactly the same status in Burma that Puyi enjoyed in Manchukuo as part of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, saying that as an Asian it was his fondest wish that Japan would <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> it had done in Manchukuo in Burma. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg sarcastically wrote that USaw and the rest of Barmar nationalists who saw the Japanese as liberators from the British were not endowed with [...] "great intelligence" [...] as USaw enjoyed far more power as Prime Minister under the British than Puyi did as Emperor under the Japanese, but they got their wish to have what was done to people of Manchukuo done to their own people, observing: [...] "The use of military and civilian prisoners for bayonet practice and assorted other cruelties provided the people of Southeast Asia with a dramatic lesson on the new meaning of Bushido, the code of the Japanese warrior." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over. We had 3,000 cows, 25,000 acres of the Spade and all I had to wonder was could I ever pay for it. Ed Brass was a great teacher and cowman. I tried to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> way he taught me, and I owe him a lot." [...] Bixby said. By 1940 Bixby {{had been able to}} regain 40 square miles (100 km2) of original Spade Ranch range, including the home valley headquarters.|$|E
