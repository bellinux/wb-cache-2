The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system.

5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection,</b> electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E

40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT Urban {{transport}} {{problems have}} plagued many governments. Traffic congestion, road safety, traffic noise and pollution and infrastructure funding {{are some of}} the issues that have forced governments to employ different measures. The South African government took a position to install <b>electronic</b> <b>tolling</b> <b>collection</b> systems in urban centres to address some of the issues. This study uses the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT 2) to investigate factors that influence the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>tolling</b> tags, a critical component of the entire system. Opinions were gathered through online surveys from South African drivers. Results of the quantitative structured equation model reveal that social influence, effort expectancy, price value, performance expectancy and hedonic motivation are the key factors that influence adoption. Different strategies could be employed by traffic officials to encourage adoption including making the <b>electronic</b> <b>tolling</b> tag compatible in all concessions; and, applying differential pricing tariffs to discourage use of roads during peak periods...|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1989, the tollway {{authority}} had discussed implementing automatic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> {{across the entire}} system to relieve congestion caused by traffic stopping at mainline toll barriers. The tollway authority began testing I-Pass, the tollway system's electronic payment method, on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September 1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-Pass. By 1998, the tollway authority had installed dedicated I-Pass lanes (lanes specifically set aside for <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collections)</b> at both mainline toll barriers. In 1999, I-355 became the first tollway to receive I-Pass Express Lanes (also known as open road tolling, or ORT). With {{the installation of the}} express lanes, vehicles with I-Pass could be tolled at highway speeds of 55 mph. In 2005, the tollway authority widened the express lanes from two lanes to three lanes in each direction. This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway.|$|R

40|$|Freeways and expressways are {{considered}} {{an important part}} of any successful transportation system. These facilities carry the majority of daily trips on the transportation network. Although expressways (Toll Roads) offer high level of service, and {{are considered}} the safest among other types of roads, traditional toll plazas may have both safety and operational challenges. The traditional toll facilities still experience many crashes, many of which are severe. Therefore, the main focus {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the effect of tollbooths’ number and types (i. e. cashier lanes, coin lanes and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Toll</b> <b>Collections</b> (ETC) lanes) on safety performance at traditional toll plazas. The literature showed that about 30 to 40 percent of the total crashes on expressways occur at these facilities. An extensive data collection was conducted that included 42 traditional mainline toll plazas located on approximately 750 miles of expressways in Florida, and multiple analytical techniques were used. Based on the finding in this paper, choosing locations for the toll plazas that have safe distances from the interchanges, installing flashing lights at night time, and finding ways to improve signage and road marking are potential means of reducing lane changes before tollbooths. More research is needed and researchers may build on the results of this study...|$|R
