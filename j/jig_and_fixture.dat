The nature of <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturer as small manufacturer enterprise (SME) with relatively less resource less focus on the importance of factors that affecting project management. Therefore, this research aims to identify the important factors that affect <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> project management and to assess the degree of project management performance in a <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturer, with the focus on South Johor region. In addition, the research also aims to obtain the correlation between factors affecting project management and project management performance, as well as to develop a prediction model for project management performance. In line with this, a quantitative approach was chosen with the population consisted of all <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers in South Johor, Malaysia. Simple random probability sampling was used to include 53 <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers. Data were collected through self administered questionnaires. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis was used. Findings from the study revealed that factor that perceived as important by respondents are human factor, followed by financial, organizational, technological supply chain relationship and physical factor. In term correlation, all factors were positively correlated with project management performance except human factor where regression model suggested that two strongest predictor are technological and supply chain relationship factor. Finding from the study suggested that factor that perceived as the most important is not correlated with project management performance, and the two strong predictors were perceived at medium important level. As such, further study could be conducted to study the implementation of those factors to identify the top of importance level, the effectiveness of the implementation, the focus level of the implementation and at once analyze the challenges and problem thus obtains the remedial strategies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{successful}} {{running of}} any mass production {{depends upon the}} interchangeability to facilitate easy assembly and reduction of unit cost. Mass production methods demand a fast and easy method of positioning work for accurate operations on it. <b>Jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> are production tools used to accurately manufacture duplicate <b>and</b> interchangeable parts. <b>Jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> are specially designed so {{that large numbers of}} components can be machined or assembled identically, and to ensure interchangeability of components. The activity which we are considering is the “Stirrup Manufacturing”. Stirrups are the rectangular or square shaped frame which bounds the rods in the foundation pillars and beams. Traditionally stirrups are manufactured on a wooden platform provided with pins with respect to which the rod is bent with the help of lever. The force is applied in the form of torque and the pin works as a fulcrum point for the torque. So a special platform is being designed with <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> to improve the production rate, accuracy and comfort of the activity...|$|R
40|$|Tool {{selection}} is {{perhaps one of}} the most important functions in a process planning system because the selection of a tool affects the selection of machining parameters, <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> selection, production rate, cost of the product, and the resulting accuracy. Therefore computer-aided tool selection (CATS) is an essential element within a computer-aided process planning (CAPP) system (C. Koulamas, Tool requirements in multi-level machining systems, International Journal of Production Research, 29 (2) (1991) 417 - 437.), and in turn in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) environment. This paper proposes an object-oriented methodology for selecting the tooling parameters for parts in a CIM environment. As this system can be incorporated into both static and dynamic process planning systems, it is termed as Incorporated Tool Selection Systems (ITSS). The steps of the methodology are discussed in detail, together with an example. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demands for {{higher and higher}} accuracy on modern CNC equipment, the manufacturing processes for machining and assembling the structural components are an increasingly important factor in establishing a geometrically correct machine tool. Specifically, flatness, perpendicularity, parallelism, and straightness of interfacing surfaces determine whether the machine tool's basic accuracy. Exhibiting less geometric error allows other errors such as thermal growth, ballscrew pitch error, and control error to be isolated and more easily corrected. The geometric errors are predominately a factor of the machine tool machining and assembly process. Multiple orientations during fixturing in both assembly and machining result in significant distortions to the final assembled product. These {{are a result of}} cutting forces, fixturing deformations, gravity deformations, and bolt force deformation. By analyzing each process in detail using virtual simulation techniques, a high-fidelity model of the corresponding error at each manufacturing step can be achieved that is not physically measurable due to constraints of measurement equipment. Using simulated data as offset data in the machining process {{as well as in the}} <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design ensures a geometrically accurate final product...|$|E
40|$|A jigs and {{fixtures}} {{system is}} a critical device in manufacturing. It provides guidance for tooling and keeps the workpiece at the desired position and orientation in machining processes. It is important to ensure a product satisfying design requirement and to stabilize the product quality. <b>Jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design is a complex activity that needs extensive information and deep understanding about design, manufacturing, assembly and inspection. With the development of manufacturing technology, more and more flexible manufacturing systems and computer numerical controlled machine centers are used in industry. This causes a strong demand in computer-aided fixture design to shorten manufacturing cycle time and reduce cost. This thesis presents an object-oriented concurrent engineering system using an integrated semantic feature-based approach for automated <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design. A user may interactively design or modify a part model using the design-by-feature technique to specify all engineering properties such as material, hardness, dimension, dimensioning, tolerancing and surface finishing. A process plan will be generated for the part and it includes process details such as the machining methods, machining parameters and machining sequence arrangement. For each machining setup, a feature-based workpiece is generated from the process plan. A set of fixtures for the machining setup will be constructed based on the workpiece model and the derived cutter path. The cutter path is translated to G-code for manufacturing. The feature-based concurrent engineering system covers most application domains in production, i. e., design domain, manufacturing domain, assembly domain and inspection domain. To represent various information involved, a hierarchical structure with semantic feature definition is proposed. Semantic feature {{is defined as a}} group of abstract data with attributes not necessarily inclusive of geometric information. As sub-classes of feature, design_feature, manufacturing_feature, assembly_feature and inspection_feature are constructed to represent information in corresponding domains. Five operators used in feature transformation, namely [italic]equality, [italic]grouping, [italic]comparison, [italic]reference and [italic]reasoning, are identified and their operations within the system framework are defined. These feature classes and operators contain the vocabulary of the semantic feature-based language for information description. The concept of feature transformation is introduced. Rules for representing feature transformation in the semantic feature-based language, as the grammar of the language, are defined. The information manipulations within and across different application domains are described by feature transformations. The applications in generative process planning and automated fixture design for prismatic and cylindrical workpiece are developed. The validity of the system is verified by both simulating the cutting path on a workstation and machining the actual part on a CNC machine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper gave a {{detailed}} definition of jigs and fixtures, and also identified the numerous advantages {{that are associated}} with the use of jigs and fixtures in manufacturing to include: production increase, cost reduction, interchangeability and high accuracy of parts, reduction of the need for inspection and quality control expenses, reduction of accident as safety is improved, automation of machine tool to an appreciable extent, easy machining of complex and heavy components, as well as low variability in dimension which leads to consistent quality of manufactured products. The work also explained that since the design is dependent on numerous factors which are analyzed to achieve an optimum output, that jigs and fixtures should be made of rigid light materials to facilitate easy handling. For adequate strength and rigidity, a mild steel with 16 millimeters diameter was chosen for the design of a sample <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture.</b> Mild steel which contain about 0. 29 % of carbon are very cheap, and because of their easy availability are often the choicest material for the making of jigs of fixtures. With 1. 5 as the material factor ‘k ’ for mild steel, a feed rate of 0. 17 millimeter per revolution, and a drill diameter of 16 millimeters, the Thrust/Drilling force was calculated as 3094. 2 N. The Force acting on each of the lips was calculated as 1700 N, the Torque (M) was gotten as 1360 N-mm, while the value of the Clamping Force was also calculated as 4080 N. The calculated values confirmed that a 16 millimeter diameter mild will lead to the construction of a rigid and strong jigs and fixtures that will guarantee high machinin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a concept that shows a way to {{automatically}} create a point-based tolerance analysis model out of existing development data. Nowadays solutions for an automated tolerance simulation model creation are using a static approach for the model build-up. For this purpose product-/ production- development data are automatically mapped on preexisting models (e. g. skeleton models). If chances during development process occur, the tolerance simulation models have to be reworked. Today only simple changes in the model can be automated (e. g. change of distribution, tolerance range etc.). A complete new tolerance simulation model build-up process for dynamically changing product-/ production- development information is not possible. To give an application example, tolerance simulation models for sheet metal parts in automotive industry are based on different development data. Before the first simulation model is created (to secure the tolerance concepts etc.), all necessary information have already been developed, e. g. in the automotive industry's development process: part geometry, tolerance information, assembly graph, <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> concept, joining location and measurement points. Thus the automated simulation generation should be possible. First step is to describe an interface for a dynamic model creation in tolerance simulation systems. In a second step preprocessing of development data is necessary to map them into tolerance simulation software restrictions. This delivers a solution {{to fill the gap}} between the PDM-/ CAD and the CAT-system. The considered approach for automated tolerance simulation model creation provides the opportunity to build-up the tolerance analysis models highly efficient and almost automatically. Tolerance analysis can then be used to rapidly calculate several options. This offers the possibility to increase the product maturity level at a very early stage of the development process...|$|E
