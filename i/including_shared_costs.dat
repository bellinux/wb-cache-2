40|$|Background & objectives: India′s Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{programmes}} in the world in terms of quantities of vaccines administered, number of beneficiaries, number of immunization sessions, and geographical extent and diversity of areas covered. Strategic planning for the Programme requires credible information on the cost of achieving the objectives and the financial resources needed at national, State, and district levels. We present here expenditures on immunization services in India in 2012 (baseline) and projected costs for five years (2013 - 2017). Methods: Data were collected from the Immunization Division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and immunization partners, such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The cost components were immunization personnel, vaccines and injection supplies, transportation, trainings, social mobilization, advocacy and communication activities, disease surveillance, Programme management, maintenance of cold chain and other equipment, and capital costs. Results: Total baseline expenditure was ₹ 3, 446 crore [1 crore = 10 million] (US$ 718 million), <b>including</b> <b>shared</b> personnel <b>costs.</b> In 2012, the government paid for 90 per cent of the Programme. Total resource requirements for 2013 - 2017 are ₹ 34, 336 crore (US$ 5, 282 million). Allocations for vaccines increase from ₹ 511 crore in 2013 to ₹ 3, 587 crore in 2017 as new vaccines are assumed to be introduced in the Programme. Interpretation & conclusions: The projections show that the government immunization budget will be double in 2017 as compared to 2013. It will increase from ₹ 4, 570 crore in 2013 to ₹ 9, 451 crore in 2017...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{sophistication of}} {{component}} technologies {{and the rising}} costs and uncertainties of developing and launching new products require firms to collaborate {{in the development of}} new products. However, the management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms presents a new set of challenges in <b>sharing</b> the <b>costs</b> and benefits of innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint development of products involving two firms with differing development capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond sharing of revenues to <b>include</b> <b>sharing</b> of development <b>cost</b> and work. We term these approaches that involve sharing of the development <b>cost</b> and <b>sharing</b> of the development work investment sharing and innovation <b>sharing,</b> respectively. These <b>cost</b> and effort <b>sharing</b> mechanisms have subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty, innovation sharing {{plays an important role in}} environments where projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in their capabilities, and the costs of integration of work across firms can be controlled. Our key contribution involves the modeling of joint work and decision making between collaborating firms and unearthing the complementary role of revenue, cost, and innovative effort sharing mechanisms for new product development. We translate our analytical findings into a managerial framework and illustrate the results with examples from the life-sciences and electronics industries. codevelopment, project alliances, product and supply chain innovation, technology uncertainty...|$|R
