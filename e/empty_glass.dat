5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, <b>Empty</b> <b>Glass</b> (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1978, the Inland Revenue {{informed}} Marriott that {{he still}} owed £100,000 in back tax from his Humble Pie days; he thought manager Dee Anthony had made all the necessary payments. O'Leary, Marriott's manager, advised him to leave Britain or go to prison. He sold the house in Golders Green and moved to California. Marriott, Pam and son Toby were staying with friends in Santa Cruz and Marriott formed a new band called The Firm, with Jim Leverton and (most notably) former Mountain guitarist Leslie West. But after Leverton {{had to leave the}} US due to visa problems, and disputes over potential royalties, the band broke up. Marriott was by now completely broke and forced to collect <b>empty</b> <b>glass</b> bottles to redeem them for small change. According to Leslie West, Steve needed the money and accepted a lucrative offer to reform Humble Pie.|$|E

[...] Referring to the agreed-to date between Jim and Pam, Flannery said, [...] "The point is that the elephant in the room has not only been addressed but asked to dinner. Makes Season 4 seem filled with possibilities – like an <b>empty</b> <b>glass</b> in front of a full bar." [...] In an article written around the time of actor Steve Carell's last performance on The Office in 2011, IGN's Cindy White listed Michael's quote about Jan's [...] "breast enhancement" [...] as among the best of the series. Dan Philipps, another writer for IGN, ranked Jim's date proposal among the best moments for the couple, stating that [...] "after toying with fans' expectations for two whole seasons, the series' writers finally allowed fans to breathe a sigh of relief. For many, the moment was well worth the wait." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1980: Pretenders by The Pretenders; <b>Empty</b> <b>Glass</b> by Pete Townshend ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song [...] "Rough Boys" [...] on his 1980 album, <b>Empty</b> <b>Glass.</b> He called the song a [...] "coming out, {{an acknowledgment of}} the fact that I'd had a gay life, and that I understood what gay sex was about." [...] However, in a 1994 interview for Playboy, he said, [...] "I did an interview about it, saying that [...] "Rough Boys" [...] was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my [...] "gay life," [...] which—I meant—was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all." [...] Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he at one point felt as if he was [...] "probably bisexual". Townshend also stated jokingly that he once felt sexually attracted to The Rolling Stones lead singer, Mick Jagger.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his work with the Who, Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend, along with other devotees to Meher Baba, recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings: Happy Birthday, I Am, and With Love. In response to bootlegging of these, he compiled his personal highlights (and [...] "Evolution", a collaboration with Ronnie Lane), and released his first major-label solo title, 1972's Who Came First. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs {{as well as a}} showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with The Faces' bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album (1977's Rough Mix). Townshend's solo breakthrough, following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon, was the 1980 release <b>Empty</b> <b>Glass,</b> which included a top-10 single, [...] "Let My Love Open the Door" [...] and [...] "Rough Boys". This release was followed in 1982 by All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, which included the popular radio track [...] "Slit Skirts". While not a huge commercial success, noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as [...] "Townshend's most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia." [...] Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats, releasing several story-based albums including [...] (1985), [...] (1989), and Psychoderelict (1993).|$|E

60|$|I {{did not go}} upon deck {{immediately}} after Mr. Longways had left the cabin, but sat there concerned with a great multitude of thoughts, and gazing absently at the box that held the treasure, and at the <b>empty</b> <b>glasses</b> with the dregs of the wine in the bottom.|$|R

60|$|Here I entered, bent on {{tasks as}} sincere {{as the ones}} just finished, but displeasing, because I had to mix with a low, profane set, to {{cultivate}} them, to drink occasionally despite my deftness at <b>emptying</b> <b>glasses</b> on the floor, to gamble with them and strangers, always playing {{the part of a}} flush and flashy cowboy, half drunk, ready to laugh or fight.|$|R
50|$|Predictive Drawing assesses clients' {{grasp of}} the {{concepts}} of sequential order, horizontality and verticality. In this test, there are three separate tests. One, which measures sequential order, shows an ice cream float in a clear <b>glass</b> and six <b>empty</b> <b>glasses.</b> The client is directed to draw lines in the <b>empty</b> <b>glasses</b> {{to show how the}} glasses would appear if the float were drunk with a straw. The next one, which measures horizontality, shows two empty bottles. One is upright, and the other tilted to the side. The client draws lines in the bottles to show where water would be with the bottles filled up halfway. The last test, which measures verticality, presents the clients with a drawing of a house sitting on top of a mountain. Clients draw the way the house would look if it moved to the spot marked with an “X” on the slope. Once these are finished, the assessment is complete.|$|R
