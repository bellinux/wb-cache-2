50|$|A sex bolt is a mating {{fastener}} combining a <b>fastener</b> (<b>nut)</b> with {{a fastener}} (screw). The sex bolt {{consists of a}} female (internally) threaded barrel (nut) and a male (externally) threaded screw. Both the barrel and screw have heads designed to clamp (bind) material between {{the head of the}} barrel {{and the head of the}} screw, or to bridge the gap between two parts.|$|E
50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} <b>fastener</b> (<b>nut)</b> which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|E

50|$|Steel {{has much}} higher {{strength}} than wrought iron and allowed long span bridges, high rise buildings, automobiles and other items. Steel also made superior threaded <b>fasteners</b> (screws, <b>nuts,</b> bolts), nails, wire and other hardware items. Steel rails lasted over 10 {{times longer than}} wrought iron rails.|$|R
5000|$|A parts washer is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used to remove contaminants or debris, such as dirt, grime, carbon, oil, grease, metal chips, cutting fluids, mold release agents, ink, paint, and corrosion from workpieces. Parts washers are used in new manufacturing and remanufacturing processes; they are designed to clean, degrease and dry bulk loads of small or large parts in preparation for assembly, inspection, surface treatment, packaging and distribution. Parts washers may be as simple as the manual [...] "sink-on-a-drum" [...] common to many auto repair shops, or they may be very complex, multi-stage units with pass-through parts handling systems. Parts washers are essential in maintenance, repair and remanufacturing operations as well, from cleaning <b>fasteners,</b> <b>nuts,</b> bolts and screws to diesel engine blocks and related parts, rail bearings, wind turbine gears boxes and automotive assemblies.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} also specifies what {{nuts are}} recommended {{for use with}} the defined <b>fasteners.</b> Note that <b>nuts</b> of a greater strength can also be used.|$|R
50|$|The bolt or axle has one or {{two holes}} drilled through its {{threaded}} end. The nut is torqued properly and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} <b>fastener,</b> the <b>nut</b> is rotated forward to the nearest slot. The nut is then secured with a split pin/cotter pin, R-clip or safety wire. It is a positive locking device.|$|R
50|$|An {{adjustable}} spanner (UK, {{and most other}} English-speaking countries) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada) is an open-end wrench with a movable jaw, allowing it {{to be used with}} different sizes of <b>fastener</b> head (<b>nut,</b> bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner. Several other names are in use, including the US trademark crescent wrench.|$|R
50|$|A wrench (or spanner {{outside of}} North America) {{is a tool}} used to provide grip and {{mechanical}} advantage in applying torque to turn objects—usually rotary <b>fasteners,</b> such as <b>nuts</b> and bolts—or keep them from turning.|$|R
50|$|A lug nut or wheel <b>nut</b> is a <b>fastener,</b> {{specifically}} a <b>nut,</b> used {{to secure}} a wheel on a vehicle. Typically, lug nuts are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} a hard {{metrication}} changeover was the threaded <b>fastener</b> industry (<b>nuts</b> and bolts) where 21 [...] "first choice" [...] BSW, BSF and BA series thread in the range 0BA to 1inch plus another 20 UNC and UNF fasteners were replaced by just seven metric sizes. This resulted in considerable cost savings, not only due to the reduction in inventories, but also the numbers of taps, dies, tapping and clearance drills that workshops held.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{fasteners}} {{are known}} by many different names: sex bolt, binding posts, Chicago screws, interscrews, barrel bolts, barrel nut, partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel fasteners, architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display <b>fasteners,</b> screw <b>nuts,</b> connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of fasteners {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, panic bars, and many other products.|$|R
25|$|A socket wrench, more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and <b>fasteners,</b> most commonly <b>nuts</b> and bolts. The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|R
50|$|A {{square nut}} is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} hex nuts, square nuts {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. Square nuts are typically mated with square-headed bolts. Square nuts are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the <b>fastener.</b> Square <b>nuts</b> can have standard, fine or coarse threading with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others. Most can meet either the ASTM A194, ASTM A563, or ASTM F594 standard.|$|R
50|$|These kits {{were based}} on {{original}} plans from the manufacturer. Two features present on some models were spoked wire wheels that were assembled spoke by spoke, and engines with working crankshaft and piston assemblies. Assembly was mostly accomplished with threaded <b>fasteners</b> (screws, bolts, <b>nuts)</b> and very little glue. This created finished products that could theoretically be disassembled and repaired or modified. Kits came molded in color and ready painted. Finished preassembled versions were also sold.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or <b>nut</b> <b>fastener.</b> The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} testing <b>fasteners</b> such as <b>nuts</b> and bolts is {{described}} {{which consists of}} a fixed base plate having a number of threaded and unthreaded holes of varying size for receiving the fasteners to be tested, a torque marking paper taped on top the fixed base plate for marking torque-angle indicia, a torque wrench for applying torque to the fasteners being tested, and an indicator for showing the torque applied to the fastener. These elements provide a low cost, nondestructive device for verifying the strength of bolts and nuts...|$|R
50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} fastener (also {{called an}} explosive bolt, or pyro, within context) is a <b>fastener,</b> usually a <b>nut</b> or bolt, that incorporates a pyrotechnic charge {{that can be}} initiated remotely. One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces. The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur. Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches.|$|R
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw <b>fasteners</b> such as <b>nuts</b> and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|Prevailing {{torque nuts}} are an {{extremely}} popular method of providing resistance to vibration-induced self-loosening of <b>fasteners.</b> Such <b>nuts</b> have a self-contained prevailing torque feature {{that provides a}} degree of resistance to rotation. Although such nuts are frequently used, it is not widely realized that they can occasionally come completely detached from bolts. The mechanism by which this can occur has hitherto been unidentified since {{it has not been}} possible to replicate detachment under laboratory testing. This article identifies a general condition that can result in the complete loosening and detachment of prevailing torque type nuts. This mechanism involves the application of an axial load when transverse joint slip is occurring. This article describes a modified Junker test machine that allows the application of axial loading to a joint while experiencing transverse displacement. Tests have been completed using an intermittent as well as a constant axial load. Loading in both modes has been demonstrated to result in the complete detachment of this nut type. Based on this investigation, if the magnitude of the axial loading exceeds the residual preload in the bolt retained from sustaining transverse movement alone, the all-metal type of prevailing torque nut can completely detach. Applications that involve shear and axial loading being simultaneously applied to a joint are numerous in engineering...|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of <b>fastener</b> engagement. The <b>nut</b> has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are internally threaded, spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has detents on opposite sides which force the nut segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of the nut when moved out. When the nut is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} detents presses the nut segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the detents depressed to indicate positive locking engagement of the nut. On removal, counterclockwise rotation of the nut relieves the endwise pressure on the detents, permitting internal springs to force the detents outward and allowing the nut segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R

40|$|At {{present the}} {{automotive}} industry is due to an EU directive, replacing hexavalent chrome on vehicles. This is an extensive job as hexavalent chrome is used all over the vehicle and to large extent on <b>fasteners</b> (screws, <b>nuts,</b> rivets etc.). Chrome (VI) {{is used as a}} passivating layer on mainly zinc-iron. When replacing the hexavalent chrome with a chrome (VI) free product, the passivating properties are reduced. One of the alternatives is to replace the zinc-iron coating with a zinc-nickel coating. This coating shows great promise from the corrosion resistance point of view. Zinc-nickel is a cathodically protecting coating, and will in principle dissolve to protect the substrate from corrosion. It is therefore important to understand how, and at what rates nickel is released from zinc-nickel coatings when exposed to a chloride-rich automotive environment. The potential environmental impact of nickel needs to be evaluated before Scania can introduce this alternative as corrosion protection. Tests by Scania have previously shown that contact allergy is not an issue for zinc-nickel coatings with Cr (III) passivation. Nickel release rates corresponding to 0, 12 mg m- 2 yr- 1 for zinc- 15 % nickel coatings at a pH of 4, 2 were determined from an accelerated corrosion test. Based on these values, less than 1 kg of nickel per year would be released from the Scania rolling stock if Scania were to introduce zinc-nickel coatings preferably on fasteners. This value is low compared to other sources of nickel release. In order to evaluate the toxicity of the released nickel, information about the chemical speciation, i. e. chemical forms, is needed. Total or dissolved metal are not good predictors of ecotoxicity of metals. Chemical speciation and bioavailability must be incorporated in toxicity testing. Total or dissolved metal may be used as a worst case approximation...|$|R
50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special <b>fasteners</b> like alloys, <b>nuts,</b> bolts, washers, studs, tapping, self drilling screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R
