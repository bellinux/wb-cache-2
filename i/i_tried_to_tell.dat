2500|$|Although Shilts was applauded for {{bringing}} public attention {{to bear on}} gay civil-rights issues and the AIDS crisis, he was also harshly criticized (and spat upon on Castro Street) by some in the gay community for calling for the closure of gay bathhouses in San Francisco to slow the spread of AIDS. Shilts maintained his sense of integrity in spite of being called [...] "a traitor to his own kind" [...] by a fellow Bay Area journalist. In a note included in The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, Shilts expressed his view of a reporter's duty to rise above criticism: I can only answer that <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth and, if not be objective, at least be fair; history is not served when reporters prize trepidation and propriety over the robust journalistic duty to tell the whole story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, it is," [...] said Tom, {{his voice}} {{cut short by}} gasps, {{the remains of the}} sobs. [...] "They would not hear me! <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them how you told them not, and sent them home. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about Ballhatchet--but--but they wouldn't--they said if it had been Harry, they would have attended--but they would not believe me. Oh! if Harry was but here!" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> myself {{it is good}} nature, but I know it is vanity {{that makes}} me write.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a thing I {{shall never}} tell plainly; and perhaps if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you in riddles {{you will not}} care to guess them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must give}} me time," [...] said MacIan, quite patiently, [...] "for <b>I</b> am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the whole truth. <b>I</b> am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{more of it}} than I know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Captain Brunot {{something}} of the astonishment with which this filled me, and {{for a little while}} he did not answer.|$|E
60|$|Because {{he was so}} dear, so good, so admirable. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him what}} I thought of him, but I could not {{articulate}} a word.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} that <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, when I came home, what a debt of gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt towards you?' ...|$|E
60|$|I looked round. There {{was only}} Maria in the lonely hall. Shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what my sensations were? It may sound strangely, {{but it is}} true--I felt like a sleeper, who has half-awakened from a dream.|$|R
60|$|In {{the stories}} that follow <b>I</b> am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{something}} about those people.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the whole}} tale over again {{exactly as it}} then struck me.|$|R
60|$|I {{attempted}} to reassure her. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her what {{was indeed the}} truth--that I had only been thinking of the ordinary chances and changes of life, when I spoke.|$|E
6000|$|The girl shivered. [...] "It {{is not my}} fault--I didn't {{know what}} they wanted until the Sheriff came. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him, but Joe saw me. Go right now, and send him away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply seething with excitement," [...] she answered. [...] "But I should {{hardly know}} where to begin if <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] she added. [...] "It seems such an age since I saw you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Perry, {{the child}} in the crib, has spoken about the {{problems}} he faced growing up. [...] "All the way through school I was a bully because I wanted people to hurt as bad as I did. I hated everything and everybody," [...] he said. [...] "I'm sorry about that now. When I see those people today, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that, but they just don't understand." ...|$|R
60|$|BABBALANJA--In a measure, true, your Highness. But pray you, listen; and <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the way {{in which}} Lombardo {{produced}} his great Kortanza.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is alive}} and well, I hope," [...] he {{answered}} gravely. [...] "My story will be longer, but <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>to</b> you clearly." ...|$|R
60|$|Between us {{we picked}} them up and {{replaced}} them in the broken bag, which he now held carefully {{in the hollow of}} his arm. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} {{understand}} if <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. I {{can only say}} it is a lovely place where we go when we die, and the angels don't puzzle over us at all, but love us and are glad to see us come," [...] said Nelly, soberly.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty laughed outright. [...] "Larry? Why, as <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, he {{has always}} been just like a cousin or a brother to me, and doesn't want {{anything}} but his horses and cattle and his books on political economy. Larry's quite happy with his ranching, and his dreams of the new America. Of course, they'll never come to anything; but when you can start him talking they're quite nice to listen to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very {{difficult}} to impart, sir. It is very, {{very difficult}} to speak of. If ever you make me another visit, <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mehldau {{explained}} that [...] "the order of songs is not arbitrary, and <b>I</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{a story from}} beginning to end in the way I've sequenced it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] {{said the}} girl sharply, [...] "I, at least, know what I feel myself, and <b>I</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that you must not expect too much from me." ...|$|R
60|$|Like it! Oh! {{how long}} was this mockery to go on! How long before I could find {{strength}} {{to tell him the}} truth--that this thing could never be! <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him then, but the words died away upon my lips. I would give myself one more day. After that there must be action of some sort or other. My uncle's reply would have come, and I should know exactly what lay before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw it all! I saw how {{she sold}} {{everything}} {{that would bring}} money and paid her little debts to the utmost penny; how she set her poor room {{in order for the}} last time; how she tenderly bade the doves good-by, and lay down on her bed to die. At nine o'clock last night as my bell rang over the city, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{what was going on in}} the garret where the light was dying out so fast. I cried to them with all my strength.-- ...|$|E
6000|$|They were profoundly {{impressed}} by our tent and gun, {{and sat on}} their haunches clicking their tongues {{again and again in}} admiration, saying of the tent, [...] "All the same lilly (little) house." [...] <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them of the great world to the south, and asked them a great many questions to discover how much they knew of the people or the mountains. They knew nothing of the plains Indians, but one of them had heard of Vancouver and Seattle. They had not the dignity and thinking power of the plains people, but they seemed amiable and rather jovial.|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} recent {{speculation}} {{as to the}} status of David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge with the band, Delonge confirmed during an interview with Rock Sound on November 11 that both members were still involved with Angels & Airwaves, though he did not specify to what extent, claiming [...] "I think people are just confused. I get it, but <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people <b>to</b> look at the whole project, not at any one piece. This isn’t just a band, it’s {{a little bit of a}} moving target and a much bigger project.".|$|R
60|$|So I {{come back}} to the main point of this foreword, in which <b>I</b> am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> why and how I came to write the story of a feud notorious in Arizona as the Pleasant Valley War.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah;--that I can't <b>tell.</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him some}} day, but I know that I never shall. It was because--. But, Lady Albury, I cannot tell it. Did you ever picture {{anything}} to {{yourself in a}} waking dream?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the moment}} when she spoke to me I knew what had happened. The old Indian wound (irritated, doubtless, by the violent {{exertion}} that I had imposed on myself) had opened again. I struggled against the sudden sense of faintness that seized on me; <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the people of the}} inn what to do. It was useless. I dropped to my knees; my head sunk on the bosom of the woman stretched senseless upon the low couch beneath me. The death-in-life that had got her had got me. Lost to the world about us, we lay, with my blood flowing on her, united in our deathly trance.|$|E
60|$|I had {{suspended}} my packing {{in order}} to sit on my bed and brood. I was utterly depressed. There are crises in a man's life when Reason fails to bring the slightest consolation. In vain <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> myself that what had happened was, in essence, precisely what, twenty-four hours ago, I was so eager to bring about. It amounted to this, that now, at last, Audrey had definitely gone out of my life. From now on I could have no relations with her of any sort. Was not this exactly what, twenty-four hours ago, I had wished? Twenty-four hours ago had I not said to myself that I would go away and never see her again? Undoubtedly. Nevertheless, I sat there and groaned in spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} tell them, and my father gave me my first {{thrashing}} for telling lies. When afterwards <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my aunt, she punished me again for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was forbidden to listen to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairy tale books were taken away from me for a time--because I was 'too imaginative.' Eh? Yes, they did that! My father belonged to the old school [...] . [...] . And my story was driven back upon myself. I whispered it to my pillow--my pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears. And I added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request: 'Please God I may dream of the garden. Oh! {{take me back to}} my garden! Take me back to my garden!' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{soon they}} gained courage {{to look more}} closely at the Peculiar Person. As he was a type of all the {{inhabitants}} of this extraordinary land whom they afterward met, <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what he looked like.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2012, Michael C. Hall, {{who plays}} Dexter Morgan on Dexter, {{was interviewed by}} Jian Ghomeshi on the Canadian radio show Q. Hall {{said he does not}} think Dexter {{supports}} the lifestyle of serial killers. [...] "I would hope that people's appreciation was more than some sort of fetishization with the kill scenes," [...] he said. Ghomeshi brought up Twitchell and Hall said, [...] "I wouldn't stop making Dexter because someone was fascinated by it only in that way. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> myself that their fixated nature would have done it one way or the other, but it seems that Dexter {{had something to do with}} it. It's horrifying." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pallas and the Madonna were {{supposed}} to be all the world's Pallas, and all the world's Madonna. They could teach all men, and they could comfort all men. But, look strictly into the nature of the power of your Goddess of Getting-on; and you will find she is the Goddess--not of everybody's getting on--but only of somebody's getting on. This is a vital, or rather deathful, distinction. Examine it in your own ideal of the state of national life which this Goddess is to evoke and maintain. I asked you what it was, when I was last here;[5]--you have never told me. Now, shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you? ...|$|R
