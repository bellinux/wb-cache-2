The following week it rose to number 39, and on March 16 of the same year, it reached the top position. It became Streisand's second number one and seventh top five album, with the other number-one being People (1964). The Way We Were spent two weeks at the highest position before falling to number four on March 30. It continued <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> the charts but managed {{to stay within the}} top 10 of the list for a total of six weeks. The Recording Industry Association of America changed its certification status to Platinum for shipments upwards of 1,000,000 sales, and again on September 23, 1998, The Way We Were was certified for selling over 2,000,000 copies. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number 49 in May 1974, and was certified Silver for shifting 60,000 physical copies.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply {{in the nature of the}} instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E

The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of the}} first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an {{instrumental}} track, [...] "The Urban Theme", which {{begins with the}} sound of a stylus <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> a vinyl record. The track's prominent funk sound is reminiscent of the music of the Brand New Heavies. [...] "Welcome" [...] features the album's prominent sexual vibe, and contains a quiet storm sound and saxophone. The two opening tracks both contain prominent funk influence. Roni Sarig wrote that their [...] "early '80s full-band R and jazz pop grooves are reminiscent of Maze's brightest days and Steely Dan's coolest nights." [...] The funk-influenced [...] "Sumthin' Sumthin'", which was co-written by Leon Ware, contains a strong, rhythmically tight groove created by the implementation of the [...] "pocket" [...] bass technique. Co-written by songwriter Itaal Shur, [...] "Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)" [...] opens with a funky groove and bass line, and features a forceful rhythm and rough funk sound. The song contains strong gospel overtones with references to God in the lyrics. The song has been covered by gospel artists such as Londa Larmond and LaShun Pace.|$|E

500|$|... "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of a stylus <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> a vinyl record. The line [...] "Hey, pretty lady" [...] is {{declared}} by a deep voice, and Timberlake sings [...] "This goes out to you!". ABC News reporter Allan Raible wrote that [...] "such a move seems engineered to make gullible teen girls in the audience scream". The lyrics feature daft double-entendres and are complemented by spoken-word background vocals. MusicOMH's David Meller wrote that the song's transition into [...] "’70s funk-cum-porno keyboards" [...] is likable, but may seem ridiculous to many listeners. The string loops and the record scratches on the song complete [...] "the faux-vintage" [...] vibe of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum". Raible concluded that it attempts to sound like Michael Jackson's 2002 song [...] "Butterflies" [...] because of its delicate tone. According to Clyde Erwin Barretto of Prefix Mag, [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] takes its R style in a more avant-garde direction, but its second half is more classic-sounding. Craig Manning of the Western Herald said that the first half of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] draws from Frank Ocean's psychedelic style of R, while the outro is more comparable to the music of 'NSYNC, Timberlake's former group. Jason Lipshutz called the outro [...] "sashaying" [...] and [...] "pleasant".|$|E
500|$|A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was {{launched}} on several websites in early November 2010.

Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see...

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave Beyoncé critical acclaim, favoring performances of [...] "underdog tracks" [...] such as [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Love On Top". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone also complimented Beyoncé's performance of the song, commending how she turned [...] "the groovy 'Love on Top' into a vintage soul showcase, <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> bended knee to unleash melismas at the top of her vocal range." [...] Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal commented that [...] "the focus was on her voice [...] 'Love on Top' [...] she changes key four times — impressive on the album but even more so in person." [...] Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine stated that the fact that Beyoncé goes through four key changes is [...] "quite a feat for any singer."

500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get a sense of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs <b>dropping</b> <b>on</b> us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E
