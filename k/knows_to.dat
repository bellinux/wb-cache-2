5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> be of the prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately <b>knows,</b> <b>to</b> draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use uberrima fides), it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E
500|$|Dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{was first}} described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. Galileo realized that simple velocity addition {{demands that the}} concept of an [...] "absolute rest frame" [...] did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a [...] "natural state" [...] of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls {{at the foot of the}} mast, as if the cannonball <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 10, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with Will Allen, a country lad, who is unhappy at home, owing {{to the fact that}} he is a studious little chap and prefers his books to farm work, which incurs the displeasure and enmity of his stepfather, a rough and surly farmer, to whom book learning does not appeal. Will runs away from home, and although his mother keeps a light in the window, hoping to guide her boy home, he never returns. Twenty years later, when the boy has made a place for himself in the world as a successful lawyer, he goes back to the farm, only to find that his little mother, who has been left a widow, has gone away, whither, no one knows. The mother, in the meantime, being left alone in the world, goes to the city and there supports herself by dressmaking. While shopping in a department store she is unjustly accused of shoplifting. The only person who believes in her innocence is a salesgirl, who is discharged for her presumption and daring to correct her superiors. The girl, in her efforts to help the friendless old lady, enlists the aid of Will, whom she <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> be a lawyer of great ability. Will is about to refuse the case, as the dry goods company is a client of his, when the girl describes the lonely old lady, and begs him for the sake of his mother to befriend her. Will consents. Will's clear statement of the case to the judge, together with May's testimony, frees the mother. When her counsel approaches to offer his congratulations, mutual recognition results." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66, based on 10 reviews. Al Shipley of the Baltimore City Paper gave the album a positive review, saying [...] "Stay Trippy winds up {{as something of}} a triumph, one of the year's most thoroughly enjoyable major label albums." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Fans will need four or five hands to count all the other laugh-out-loud punch lines, and even if this album is redundant and overstuffed with hedonism and recklessness, that's just Juicy being Juicy." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect stated, [...] "Stay Trippy is as wild as modern hip-hop gets. It's a slick, seductive, and stone romp through a hazy synth boom, strip club-ready beats, and some of Juicy J's tightest rapping to date." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying [...] "Despite the wild assortment of flows and flavors, Juicy J manages to avoid being eclipsed on his own project. Their presence only amplifies the quality of his offering, a hypothesis that is reinforced by three of the album's standout pieces." [...] B.J. Steiner of XXL said, [...] "Stay Trippy is a record that <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> stay within the lane that it's carved for itself. Big-budget stripper rap has rarely sounded so fresh." [...] Nick Henderson of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "On Stay Trippy, Juicy J sounds as energized, self-assured, and dangerous as ever." [...] Patrick Taylor of RapReviews.com stated, [...] "Even if Juicy J's brand of explicit hip-hop isn't your cup of syrup, you have to admire the man for staying relevant and good as he nears his third decade in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Hebel's second famous work is his {{calendar}} stories, {{which he}} wrote from 1803 on for the Badische Landkalender and especially from 1807 for its successor, the Rheinländischer Hausfreund. This old Lutheran calendar was selling poorly in the early 19th century, and Hebel {{was a member of}} the commission appointed to suggest improvements. After several discussions, Hebel finally became editor of the new calendar, which was first released in 1807. One of the biggest improvements was to have more text, featuring [...] "instructive news and funny stories". Hebel wrote about 30 of these stories each year, and they were highly successful. The Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreundes was issued in 1811 as a collection of the most interesting of these stories. Further editions followed in 1816 and 1827. The calendar stories included news, short stories, anecdotes, comical stories and modified fairy tales. They were intended both to entertain and to provide moral education. The best-known of Hebel's calendar stories are [...] "Unverhofftes Wiedersehen" [...] (unexpected reunion) and [...] "Kannitverstan" [...] (I cannot understand). The philosopher Ernst Bloch called the first [...] "the most beautiful story of the world". There was a dispute in 1815, as Hebel's calendar story [...] "Der fromme Rat" [...] (pious advice), issued in 1814, was partially criticised by Catholics as being offensive, leading to its removal from the calendar. There he portrays a Catholic who prays to heaven instead of to the cross-bearing priest; the change can be viewed as a conversion of the Catholic to Protestantism. Hebel rounded off his story with the words: [...] "The family friend <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> praise and venerate that, although he has never prayed to a rosary, else he would not write to the Lutheran calendar." [...] Subsequently, Hebel resigned as editor and wrote far fewer calendar stories, except in 1819, when he wrote more than ever to make that year's issue of the Rheinländischer Hausfreund possible.|$|E
500|$|J.R. {{explains}} to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is doing fine, leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E
