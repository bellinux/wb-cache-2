This final project report tries to describe the English teaching and learning process of VII grade students of SMP Negeri 1 Gatak especially in teaching writing procedure text, {{the problems in the}} process of teaching and learning writing to VII grade students of SMP Negeri 1 Gatak and the solutions for those problems. The methods used in collecting data in the final project report were observation and interview. The writer observed directly the condition of both school and classes. The writer also interviewed some school staffs including teachers, administration staffs and students. The writer encountered some problems during the process of teaching writing procedure genre for the VII grade students of SMP Negeri 1 Gatak. The problems from the students on their writing are the misuse of <b>imperative</b> <b>words,</b> adjective and prepositions. The problems faced by students are the misspelling and mispronouncing English words and limited vocabulary, while the problems faced by teachers are less-motivated and uncooperative students. The writer also suggested some solutions to overcome those problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} an attempt to use the so-called "analytical syntheticfunctional" method to describe the formation of the synthetic <b>imperative</b> <b>word</b> forms in Russian. This method was initially developed to describe the inflection of Russian verbs in the preterit and present tenses (Lehfeldt, 1978 a; Lehfeldt, 1978 b) and was later also utilized in studies analyzing the formation of the present tense in Serbo-Croatian (Kempgen and Lehfeldt, 1978), Macedonian (Kempgen, 1979), Slovak (Lehfeldt, 1979), Czech (Berger, 1981) and Bulgarian (Kaltwasser and Kempgen, 1981). In this study we will furnish only {{a brief description of the}} "analyticalsynthetic- functional" method; for additional information the reader is advised to refer to Lehfeldt (1978 a), which discusses the method's basics as well as the Steps involved in its application. The method itself is divided into three principal parts. In the first, the "analytical" section, the various means of expression which a language uses to construct particular word forms are described and analyzed. In the second, "synthetic" part, the relationships between the various means of expression are examined; that is, the theoretically possible combinations of the means of expression are compared with the combinations actually occurring in reality. This comparison in turn makes possible an initial numerical characterization of particular Subsystems by means of the socalled "measure of combination". Furthermore, the relationships between the above-mentioned means of expression and the carriers of the nongrammatical meaning of the word-forms, the so-called "basic forms", are analyzed. In this manner we obtain a further numerical characterization of the given Subsystem, the "measure of predictability". In the final, "functional" part of the method, we are primarily concerned with the actual functional load of the individual means of expression and their various combinations. Before we begin with the description of word-form formation in the imperative, it is necessary to separately discuss a problem which we have designated the "delimitation of synthetic word forms", a problem which in contrast to the present or preterit tenses - has not been satisfactorily solved for the imperative...|$|R

Providing support, services through intervention programs at the school site can address a world of circumstances that might otherwise go unnoticed. Furthermore, by acknowledging, identifying and providing supports, students can far exceed expectations on an academic and personal level. Data for this qualitative study were collected and analyzed. One-on-one interviews, involving 22 questions, were conducted with five high school administrators at sites that oversee the intervention programs at their respective sites. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, and then coded and analyzed with Dedoose web-based qualitative data analysis software. The findings focused on six major areas: support programs, referral process, academic setting, academics, discipline and attendance. Analysis of the qualitative interview data showed that in many identified themes and subthemes, administrators revealed that the support and services delivered through intervention programs positively impact student academics, behavior and attendance. The administrators??? perceptions link the positive impact and the need for intervention programs to support students??? academic and personal needs...|$|R

All the states are faced with the challenge of reconciling the need to control and reduce public spending with greater financial autonomy in local government; they are accordingly seeking ways of achieving an equitable distribution of financial resources among the different levels of government in a context of budgetary cutbacks at every level of public administration. If strengthening democracy means strengthening local self-government, this in turn means establishing systems of financing for local authorities which are at once efficient, fair and consistent with the state's economic <b>imperatives.</b> In other <b>words,</b> the principle of subsidiary, decentralization and local finances are all interdependent. In Romania this process started in 1990 and it is on the move even today.

However, they are not capable ofdealing with cognitive uncertainties like vagueness and ambiguity <b>imperative</b> to real <b>word</b> decision makingsituations. Fuzzy Classification Rules (FCRs) based on fuzzy logic provide a framework for a flexiblehuman like reasoning involving linguistic variables. Moreover, a classification system consisting of simple‘If-Then’ rules is not competent in handling exceptional circumstances. In this paper, we propose aGenetic Algorithm approach to discover Fuzzy Censored Classification Rules (FCCRs). A FCCR is aFuzzy Classification Rule (FCRs) augmented with censors. Here, censors are exceptional conditions inwhich the behaviour of a rule gets modified. The proposed algorithm works in two phases. In the firstphase, the Genetic Algorithm discovers Fuzzy Classification Rules. Subsequently, these FuzzyClassification Rules are mutated to produce FCCRs in the second phase. The appropriate encodingscheme, fitness function and genetic operators are designed for the discovery of FCCRs. The proposedapproach for discovering FCCRs is then illustrated on a synthetic dataset...|$|R
40|$|Čestica že jedna je od najučestalijih riječi u hrvatskoglagoljskim tekstovima pisanima hrvatskim crkvenoslavenskim jezikom. Budući da je izraziti crkvenoslavenizam, ona je ujedno dobar razlikovni element u prepoznavanju ovih tekstova. Najčešće služi kao adjunktivna čestica ili kao parataktički veznik. Također je često i navezak drugim riječima uz koje je prvotno stajala kao pojačajna čestica. U ovom radu ispituje se status takvoga, izvorno pojačajnoga že, kao samostalne riječi u hrvatskome crkvenoslavenskome. The {{particle}} že {{is among}} the most frequent words in Croatian Glagolitic texts written in Croatian Church Slavonic Language. Furthermore, as a distinct Church Slavonic word it is a good distinctive feature for the identification of such texts. It is often used as an adjunctive particle or a coordinating conjunction. We can also frequently find it in the function of a simple affix to different words with which it initially stood enhancing their meaning. This paper examines the status of that kind of že, the emphatic one, as an independent word in Croatian Church Slavonic. It is shown that the particle že – already only sporadically confirmed in its emphatic role in Old Church Slavonic with <b>imperatives,</b> question <b>words</b> or other words that carry emphasis – in the Croatian Glagolitic texts appears as a distinct archaism that, through various editorial interventions, was usually disposed of from the system. This might be attributed {{to the fact that the}} original Glagolitic texts were either adapted to Latin or created according to the Latin template, and that the Latin language did not have a corresponding particle. But its disappearance is more likely due to the fact that the Church Slavonic texts emerged in the area where the (Čakavian) Croatian language was spoken, in which že had probably already disappeared long since and functioned only as a phonetically changed affix -re...|$|R

This study aims to design the control system of an internal combustion engine test unit. In the study, the performance parameters of an available internal combustion engine have been transferred to computer in real time. A data acquisition (DAQ) card has been used to transfer the experimental data to the computer. Also, a user interface has been developed for performing the necessary procedures by using LabVIEW. The dynamometer load, the fuel consumption, and the desired speed can easily be adjusted precisely by using DAQ card and the user interface during the engine test. Load, fuel consumption, and temperature values (the engine inlet-outlet, exhaust inlet-outlet, oil, and environment) can be seen on the interface and also these values can be recorded to the computer. It is expected that developed system will contribute both to the education of students and to the researchers’ studies and so it will eliminate a major lack...|$|R

This is a qualitative study as it investigates a special case of online shopping in Semarang. The data were collected from online shopping broadcasts in the writer’s Blackberry Messenger and Facebook. Based on the data from the broadcast of ten online shops the writer found that sellers used intra-sentential code switching (79. 45 percent) more frequently than inter-sentential codeswitching (20. 54 percent). Further analysis of the intra-sentential code switching revealed out of 141 English words, nouns are the most common parts of speech (43. 97 percent), noun phrases (19. 86 percent), adjectives (14. 89 percent) and verbs (12. 06 percent). Besides, it is found that the use of English words can be classified into three: Borrowed words, online shopping jargons, and other random words commonly used in online interaction. In this research, the writer found 15 inter-sentential code switching and most of the sentences are <b>imperative.</b> In other <b>words,</b> the advertisers code switched to give instructions to the readers or customers. Among the words used in online shopping, the words order and sold are used more often than other words. This {{is due to the fact}} that the words are very essential in trading or business...|$|R
50|$|The next {{predominant}} {{school of}} thought in normative ethics is consequentialism. While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral <b>imperative</b> (in other <b>words,</b> {{the emphasis is on}} obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome. Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects. The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable. The Greatest Happiness Principle of John Stuart Mill {{is one of the most}} commonly adopted criteria. Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness. He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts. For a more complete outline of the niceties of Mill's classification system see the page on utilitarianism or read Mill's works Utilitarianism, Defense of Utilitarianism, and On Liberty. Examining the meta-ethical theories of naturalism, upon which many consequentialist theories rely, may provide further clarification. Having looked at the other two normative ethical theories we come at last to virtue ethics.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Communicable disease crises can {{endanger the}} health care system and often require special {{guidelines}}. Understanding reasons for nonadherence to crisis guidelines is needed to improve crisis management. We identified and measured barriers and conditions for optimal adherence as perceived by 4 categories of health care professionals. METHODS: In-depth interviews were performed (n = 26) to develop a questionnaire for a cross-sectional survey of microbiologists (100 % response), infection preventionists (74 % response), public health physicians (96 % response), and public health nurses (82 % response). The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5 -point Likert scale. When at least 33 % of the participants responded "strongly agree," "agree," or "rather agree than disagree," a barrier was defined as "often experienced. " The common ("generic") barriers were included in a univariate and multivariate model. Barriers specific to the various groups were studied as well. RESULTS: Crisis guidelines were found to have 4 generic barriers to adherence: (1) lack of <b>imperative</b> or precise <b>wording,</b> (2) lack of easily identifiable instructions specific to each profession, (3) lack of concrete performance targets, and (4) lack of timely and adequate guidance on personal protective equipment and other safety measures. The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. CONCLUSION: To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent. Profession-specific barriers require profession-specific strategies to change attitudes, ensure organizational facilities, and provide an adequate setting for crisis management...|$|R

40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{here is a}} brief {{excerpt of}} the content: In a recent attempt to update the 1948 World Health Organization {{definition}} of health as a state of complete well-being and absence of disease, {{it has now been}} proposed to change its emphasis to the ability to adapt and self manage in the face of social, physical and emotional challenges (Huber et al., 2011). The question how we should conceptualize such self-management, however, is rarely raised and its theoretical foundations remain largely unexplained. Still, to an increasing extent, scholars, health professionals, researchers, caretakers and policy makers emphasize the great potential of self-management strategies in somatic as well as mental healthcare. Patients, so the argument runs, should not be treated merely as objects of diagnosis and treatment, but as "expert clients", actively involved in the management of their own care. The advantages of this approach are considered twofold: it holds the prospect of more efficient and (cost) effective preventive and care strategies to promote mental health and well-being, and converges with recent research findings which acknowledge that incorporating the patients' subjective perspectives is beneficial to treatment progress. At the same time, it is clear that self-management in the context of mental healthcare poses profoundly challenging problems (Van Geelen, 2013; Van Geelen, 2014), as we need to take into account that it is often "the self" that {{is part and parcel of}} the problem in psychiatric and psychosomatic conditions (Kyrios et al., 2015; Santhouse, 2008; Sadler, 2007). In the context of mental healthcare, then, self-management confronts us with fundamental questions: what is our understanding of this self in psychosomatic and psychiatric settings, and how does that understanding, directly or indirectly, affect diagnoses, treatment plans and nosology in the fields of psychopathology and psychosomatic medicine? Answering such questions will also be of vital importance to a theoretically sound and practically relevant, implementable notion of self-management. Given the complexity of this subject matter, addressing such [End Page 179] problems requires an interdisciplinary approach, as we have argued in the introduction (Van Geelen & Franssen, 2017). A conceptual framework for self-management should integrate insights from a variety of disciplines, as it needs to acknowledge the multifaceted character of self-experience – with all its embodied, affective, cognitive, moral and social complexities. It is <b>imperative,</b> in other <b>words,</b> that insights in the structure and characteristics of self and self-experience as developed in humanities traditions – i. e., phenomenology, philosophy of mind and action, ethics, narrative theory – are brought into a dialogue with results obtained in psychiatric and psychosomatic research and practice...|$|R
