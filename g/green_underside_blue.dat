5000|$|... 'Green Goddess' has green {{stripes on}} the spathes which allow the flowers to last {{much longer than}} the {{original}} white form.

The first generation hybrid of 'Green Goddess' and the original white form have a light <b>green</b> <b>underside</b> on the spathe, allowing the flower to last longer than the original white form, but no green stripes on the top side. The New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord proscribes the cultivation, sale, and distribution of 'Green Goddess'.|$|R

50|$|Trithrinax campestris is a monocot {{flowering}} palm {{of relative}} low height (up to 6 m tall) and 20-25 cm wide stems usually covered by remains of earlier foliage {{that act as}} a thick protective coat. Caranday leaves are about 1 m long, palmate, rounded, with a very rigid and spiny petiole. The leaflet segments are rigid, dark green to a more blue hue, with light <b>green</b> <b>undersides.</b> These are possibly the toughest leaves among arecaceae.

Flowers compose highly branched inflorescences located {{at the base of}} the lower living leaves. These contain up to 100 white hermaphrodite flowers 10 to 12 mm wide. This palm flowers in autumn. Fruits ripen towards the end of the next summer. They consist of subspherical yellow brownish drupes, 1 to 2 cm wide, with a thin fleshy mesocarp and a fibrous endocarp.
