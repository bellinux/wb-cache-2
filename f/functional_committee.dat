50|$|Laws {{most often}} {{originate}} at the Ministries, which {{are responsible for}} both drafting laws and amending new laws. Once the Minister approves the draft law, it {{is sent to the}} Prime Ministers Office and Office of Legal Support Services. OLSS is responsible for coordination and review of all draft laws drafted by the government. Once the OLSS reviews the law, a request is submitted to the Permanent Secretary of the PMO to establish a working group at the government level. After the government working group completes its review the, law is sent to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) and Ministry for European Integration (MEI), before it will make its final rounds at the Assembly. The MOEF reviews the financial and budgetary implications of the law, while the MEI evaluates if the law is compatible with the EU legislation. Upon their approval of the law, the draft is sent to the PS of the PMO to be included on the agenda of the Government Coordinating Group for a final review. This is also the final step in the legal drafting process within the Government. Draft law is then forwarded to the Kosovo Assembly for their review.The law is afterwards registered with the Table Office at the Assembly.

5000|$|In the 1973, {{around the}} time the Caribbean Free Trade Association was being {{transformed}} into CARICOM, Suriname was granted Liaison Status/Observer Status in the Association. This followed on from a decision of the Conference of Commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government in 1972 to study the possibility of extending the integration movement to include all the Caribbean islands and Suriname. On 14 April 1974, Suriname (along with Haiti) signified its desire to join CARICOM at the ceremony in St. Lucia marking {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Chaguaramas by the LDCs. Talks of regional cooperation between Suriname and CARICOM were undertaken in the early 1970s, but integration was not further pursued, in part due to the perceived difficulties of integrating Suriname's very different legal system with that of the Commonwealth Caribbean countries. Suriname continued to be an observer with regards to CARICOM after it came into existence, participating in a number of meetings of <b>functional</b> <b>committees</b> since the 1970s. In the 1980s, Suriname expressed renewed interest in CARICOM with initiatives to seek closer ties with the Community being welcomed in January 1982 by then Secretary-General Dr. Kurleigh King on a visit to the country and the Surinamese application for closer relations with the Community being considered at the November 1982 Conference of the Heads of Government. However, opposition by the member states to fuller Surinamese participation in CARICOM developed after the December 1990 [...] "telephone coup" [...] in Suriname, although Suriname retained observer status. After democracy and civilian control was restored through the 1991 elections, Suriname began taking concrete steps to open its economy, emerge from isolation, and forge a new regional identity. As a result, the ties between Suriname and the Community deepened and a Coordinating Unit for CARICOM Affairs was established and located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Suriname. The CARICOM Coordinating Unit in Suriname had a core of three officers and was assisted in its task by CARICOM focal point officers representing the various other ministries with a supportive role being played by the Embassy of Guyana.|$|R

40|$|The present code PD 5500, {{formerly}} BS 5500 [1] evolved {{partly from}} the well-known BS 1500 [2] in the 1950 's and BS 1515 [3] {{first published in}} 1965; the latter permitted higher level allowable stresses and more advanced rules. In 1969, following {{a report from the}} Committee of Enquiry into the Pressure Vessel Industry, the British Standards Institution brought all the pressure vessel interests together under one general committee in order to rationalise the activity. This became PVE/ and presides over a large committee structure. There are a series of functional sub-committees who deal with specific aspects and a large number of technical committees as well as many additional sub committees and working groups. Most of these meet regularly. The technical committee PVE/ 1, Pressure Vessels, has overall responsibility for BS 5500. The <b>functional</b> <b>committee</b> PVE/ 1 / 15 Design Methods has an overall responsibility relating to 'Design' with particular reference to the design section of BS 5500 (Section 3). The first edition of BS 5500 was issued in 1976. The actual issue was delayed for some time because, in the early 1970 's, there was an attempt in Europe to produce an international pressure vessel standard. A draft of the international standard appeared as ISO DIS 2694 [4] in 1973 but it was not generally accepted and the attempt was abandoned in the mid 70 's. It was decided to use some of the material from 2694 within BS 5500 so that although the Standard was long delayed it benefited to some extent from the international efforts. Initially, committee PVE/l set out the concept of a "master" pressure vessel standard which could readily be applied to any vessel in either ferrous or non-ferrous materials and for highly specialised application with the minimum of supplementary requirements. The layout of BS 5500 is consistent with this concept and although the Standard has perhaps not fulfilled this high ideal, it has certainly been employed widely in many industries including non pressure vessel type applications. When issued it had a number of distinctive features compared with other pressure codes viz; weld joint factors were removed, the present three categories of construction were introduced, there was a new novel external pressure section, it has a loose leaf format and an annual updating was introduced. Further editions of BS 5500 have been issued every three years since 1982...|$|E

The election of the State Labor government in early 1983 saw to the build up of a political agenda for system level change in education. The expectation of the Government was that public schools would raise their standards of achievement, be more responsive and be more accountable. Following a comprehensive review of educational policy and practice (Beazley 1984) it was announced that a <b>Functional</b> Review <b>Committee</b> would investigate the structure and operation of the educational bureaucracy. In January 1987 the newly established Ministry of Education (Western Australia) released 2 ̆ 7 Better Schools in Western Australia: A Programme for Improvement. 2 ̆ 7 The document is a blue print for a new style of school operations. The determination of the Ministry of Education to commence implementation of the proposals according to a timeline brought criticism from the teachers 2 ̆ 7 union and the principals 2 ̆ 7 associations. The main contentious issue was the speed at which the proposals would be implemented. In the period of political brinkmanship which followed side issues emerged concerning the rights of groups to be consulted as well as concerns about staffing, workloads and career structures.

40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to determine the impact of the affiliation concept in fulfilling the legislative intent for the reorganization of school districts as adopted by the Nebraska Legislature in 1988. Affiliation is defined as an ongoing association of a Class I School District with one or more grade K– 12 school districts for the purpose of providing instruction for high school students residing in a Class I School District and providing a common tax base to finance the program. ^ The population for this study consisted of 75 grade K– 12 school districts in the State of Nebraska that had been identified in the 2000 / 01 Nebraska Educational Directory as the primary high school district for at least one Class I School District. Superintendents were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding seven concepts included in the affiliation process: curriculum coordination, cooperative programs, student services, bond elections, student transportation, special taxing funds, and advisory committees. ^ Of the grade K– 12 school districts included in the study, fewer than one-half participated in any curriculum coordination activities, nearly three-fourths participated in at least one cooperative program, about one-half provided at least one service, and fewer than one-third provided daily transportation to high school students. More than one-half of the grade K– 12 school districts that had an unsuccessful bond election prior to affiliation experienced a successful bond election after affiliation. Three-fourths of the grade K– 12 school districts did not have any special taxing funds for the improvement of high school facilities and less than one-half had a <b>functional</b> advisory <b>committee.</b> ^ A review of Nebraska Department of Education records indicated that one-third of the Class I School Districts dissolved and merged with another school district since the inception of affiliation. An analysis of the financial support for an affiliated school system indicated that the property taxes increased dramatically for the Class I School Districts, while the property taxes for the grade K– 12 school districts increased only slightly. ...|$|R
