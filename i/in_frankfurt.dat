5|$|The 1980s were a {{difficult}} time financially, with less foreign work coming through; though they headed the consortium that built the Mosul Dam in Iraq from 1981-84. There was domestic growth, highlighted by the architecturally radical Messe Torhaus <b>in</b> <b>Frankfurt,</b> completed in 1984. It was later involved {{in the construction of}} the Messeturm in the same city; once completed in 1991 it was Europe's tallest building. In the mid-1990s, Hochtief was involved in yet another major skyscraper development <b>in</b> <b>Frankfurt,</b> the Commerzbank Tower, which overtook the Messeturm to become Europe's tallest building, losing the record to Triumph-Palace in Moscow in 2003.|$|E
5|$|After Bethe {{received}} his doctorate, Erwin Madelung offered him an assistantship <b>in</b> <b>Frankfurt,</b> and in September 1928 Bethe {{moved in with}} his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934. Bethe did not find the work <b>in</b> <b>Frankfurt</b> very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie ("The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter"). Starting from Max Born's interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula. He submitted this paper for his habilitation in 1930.|$|E
