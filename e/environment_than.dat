5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. Staffer Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the player in {{a portion of a}} Halo 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described one advantage of the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tweedy was {{preoccupied with}} trying to {{establish}} Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist. Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan {{also contributed to the}} album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett. Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one ("It's Just That Simple") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album.|$|E

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

25|$|Excluding {{contained}} {{waste and}} unintentional releases from nuclear plants, coal-plants carry more radioactive wastes into the <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> nuclear plants {{per unit of}} produced energy.

This comparison does not consider {{the rest of the}} fuel cycle, i.e., coal and uranium mining and refining and waste disposal. The operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E

25|$|The {{plant has}} a {{branching}} root system with one primary root that reaches {{deeply into the}} moist soil. Buckwheat has triangular seeds and produces a flower that is usually white, although can also be pink or yellow. Buckwheat branches freely, as opposed to tillering or producing suckers, causing a more complete adaption to its <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> other cereal crops. The seed hull density is {{less than that of}} water, making the hull easy to remove.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{interactive}} {{models have}} been developed that respond to actions taken by a student or physician.

These Svobodniki (Russian: free people) generally refused {{to send their children}} to government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school.|$|E

25|$|It {{follows from}} the second law of {{thermodynamics}} that the entropy {{of a system that}} is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper tests two {{competing}} explanations {{of differences in}} returns to cultural capital across schooling environments: Cultural reproduction (cultural capital yields a higher returns in high-achieving <b>environments</b> <b>than</b> in low-achieving ones) and cultural mobility (cultural capital yields higher returns in low-achieving environments). Using multilevel mixture models, empirical results from analyses based on PISA data from three countries (Canada, Germany, and Sweden) show that returns to cultural capital tend to be higher in low-achieving schooling <b>environments</b> <b>than</b> in high-achieving ones. These results principally support the cultural mobility explanation and suggest that research should pay explicit attention to the institutional contexts in which cultural capital is converted into educational success...|$|R
40|$|Velar stops, and velar fricatives {{may become}} palatalized before front vowels in the dialects of Chile and Mexico, and palatalized before /a/, {{which has been}} fronted, in Castilian Spanish. These sound changes are fairly common in the world's languages, but {{research}} proves {{that it is not}} certain under which circumstances these sound changes take place and to what extent in each dialect. Acoustic data is provided in support of the hypothesis that Chilean Spanish palatalizes in more <b>environments</b> <b>than</b> the other two dialects, although Castilian may palatalize in different <b>environments</b> <b>than</b> the other two dialects due to a historical shift in the Gallo-romance languages (before front vowels and /a/) ...|$|R

25|$|Males who {{under some}} {{circumstances}} used force {{may have had}} greater reproductive success in the ancestral <b>environment</b> <b>than</b> males who did not employ force. Sociobiological theories of rape are theories that explore to what degree, if any, evolutionary adaptations influence the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, {{political as well as}} scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures. There is extensive research on the forced sex among non-human animals.|$|E
