The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how I am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it.

500|$|From 1955 to 1958, Mugabe {{lived in}} {{neighbouring}} Northern Rhodesia, {{where he worked}} at Chalimbana Teacher Training College in Lusaka. There he continued his education by working on a second degree by correspondence, this time a Bachelor of Administration from the University of London. In 1958 he moved to Ghana to work at St Mary's Teacher Training College in Takoradi. According to Mugabe, [...] "I went [...] as an adventurist. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{what it would be}} like in an independent African state". Ghana had been the first African state to gain independence from European colonial powers and under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah underwent a range of African nationalist reforms; Mugabe revelled in this environment. In tandem with his teaching, Mugabe attended the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute in Winneba. Mugabe later claimed that it was in Ghana that he finally embraced Marxism. He also began a relationship with a Ghanaian woman, Sally Hayfron, who worked at the college and shared his political interests.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Steph was {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer and underwent a hysterectomy. The plot was said to echo {{the true story of}} former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, who died of cervical cancer in 2009. It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer. He chose to continue with it, deciding that {{it would be interesting to}} give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers [...] "know and love [...] going through a really hard time." [...] In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way. Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: [...] "Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it fresh through her eyes". She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline, and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign.|$|E

500|$|Zero has {{received}} a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she [...] "related to [...] as the game progressed, which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into [...] "a jet-black comedy", comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort: while both unlikable characters, there was [...] "something magnetic about their horribleness". Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying [...] " [...] was drawn into [...] world and its cast of characters, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Zero's journey through from start to finish." [...] This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed.|$|E
500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E

Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here.
