40|$|Florida has {{recently}} developed a new, more efficient process for conducting environmental reviews of transportation projects. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool, an interactive database and mapping application {{available on the}} Internet, is fundamental {{to the success of}} the new process. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool integrates resource and project data from multiple sources into one standard format, provides quick and standardized analysis of the effects of the proposed projects on the human and natural environment, and supports effective communication of results among all stakeholders, including the public. Because an innovative technology solution was fundamental {{to the success of the}} new process, application development occurred in conjunction with process refinements. This created a very flexible environment in which the process could be refined to take advantage of technology, and the technology could be easily adjusted, as process details were defined. As the ETDM process was refined, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool was developed using the following general steps: 1. Determine general system requirements for the conceptual process 2. Lay the database foundation 3. Design and develop the user interface in modules 4. Update and add tools within the modules as the process details are refined Version 1. 0 of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool has been tested and statewide training completed in the summer of 2003. Participant feedback on the utility of the application has been very positive. Additional enhancements will most likely continue through the first year of implementation, as the new process is refined. Requests for enhancements have been compiled and will be incorporated into version 2 of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool in the fall of 2003. The tool integrates Internet mapping technology, relational database management system and GIS. This integration was implemented using industry-standard platform-independent development tools such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Java Script, Java Server Pages (JSP) and Extensible Markup Language (XML). The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool was deployed at the University of Florida in conjunction with the Florida Geographic Data Library (FGDL), a repository of Geographic Information System data gathered from federal, state, and local governments. Users access the application from their desktop computer by connecting to a secure website using Internet Explorer. The application was jointly developed by URS and the University of Florida under contract with the Florida Department of Transportation, Environmental Management Office, with funding from the State of Florida and the Federal Highway Administration. The cost of developing the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool, Version 1, was approximately $ 1, 255, 000.

40|$|Anticancer drugs {{routinely}} used in chemotherapy enter wastewater {{through the}} excretion of the non-metabolised drug following administration to patients. This study considers the consumption and subsequent behaviour and occurrence of these chemicals in aquatic systems, {{with the aim}} of prioritising a selection of these drugs which are likely to persist in the environment and hence be considered for <b>environmental</b> <b>screening</b> programmes. Accurate consumption data were compiled from a hospital survey in NW England and combined with urinary excretion rates derived from clinical studies. Physical–chemical property data were compiled along with likely chemical fate and persistence during and after wastewater treatment. A shortlist of 15 chemicals (from 65) was prioritised based on their consumption, persistency and likelihood of occurrence in surface waters and supported by observational studies where possible. The ecological impact of these ‘prioritised’ chemicals is uncertain as the measured concentrations in surface waters generally fall below standard toxicity thresholds. Nonetheless, this prioritised sub-list should prove useful for developing <b>environmental</b> <b>screening</b> programmes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of two-dimensional (2 D) semiconductors can be signicantly altered by screening effects, either from free charge carriers {{in the material}} itself, or by <b>environmental</b> <b>screening</b> from the surrounding medium. The physical properties of 2 D semiconductors placed in a heterostructure with other 2 D materials are therefore governed by a complex interplay of both intra- and inter-layer interactions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission, {{we are able to}} isolate both the layer-resolved band structure and, more importantly, the transient band structure evolution of a model 2 D heterostructure formed of a single layer of MoS 2 on graphene. Our results reveal a pronounced renormalization of the quasiparticle gap of the MoS 2 layer. Following optical excitation, the band gap is reduced by up to ∼ 400 meV on femtosecond timescales due to a persistence of strong electronic interactions despite the <b>environmental</b> <b>screening</b> by the n-doped graphene. This points to a large degree of tuneability of both the {{electronic structure}} and electron dynamics for 2 D semiconductors embedded in a van der Waals-bonded heterostructure.

40|$|Effects of {{environmental}} dielectric materials on cross-polarized excitons of semiconducting carbon nanotubes are theoretically studied in an effective-mass scheme. When a nanotube {{is surrounded by}} a medium, the bright exciton, shifted to the high-energy side by depolarization effect, becomes weaker and disappears with the increase of the dielectric constant. When a nanotube contains a medium inside, the bright exciton becomes more eminent. The dark exciton, brightened due to electron-hole asymmetry, is enhanced with the increase of the dielectric constant both for outside and inside materials. Consequently, the relative intensity of the brightened dark exciton normalized by the bright exciton is strongly enhanced by <b>environmental</b> <b>screening,</b> in particular, for outside materials...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{positive}} {{outcome of the}} recent randomized trial of computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer, substantial implementation challenges remain, including the clear reporting of relative risk and suggested workup of screen-detected nodules. Based on current literature, we propose a 6 -level Lung-Reporting and Data System (LU-RADS) that classifies screening CTs by the nodule with the highest malignancy risk. As the LU-RADS level increases, the risk of malignancy increases. The LU-RADS level is linked directly to suggested follow-up pathways. Compared with current narrative reporting, this structure should improve communication with patients and clinicians, and provide a data collection framework to facilitate screening program evaluation and radiologist training. In overview, category 1 includes CTs with no nodules and returns the subject to routine <b>screening.</b> <b>Category</b> 2 scans harbor minimal risk, including < 5 mm, perifissural, or long-term stable nodules that require no further workup before the next routine <b>screening</b> CT. <b>Category</b> 3 scans contain indeterminate nodules and require CT follow up with the interval dependent on nodule size (small [5 - 9 mm] or large [≥ 10 mm] and possibly transient). Category 4 scans are suspicious and are subdivided into 4 A, low risk of malignancy; 4 B, likely low-grade adenocarcinoma; and 4 C, likely malignant. The 4 B and 4 C nodules have a high likelihood of neoplasm simply based on screening CT features, even if positron emission tomography, needle biopsy, and/or bronchoscopy are negative. Category 5 nodules demonstrate frankly malignant behavior on <b>screening</b> CT, and <b>category</b> 6 scans contain tissue-proven malignancies...|$|R

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{analytical system}} for the separation and detection of organic peroxides, based on a microchip capillary electrophoresis device with an integrated amperometric detector, was developed. The new microsystem relies on the reductive detection of both organic acid peroxides and hydroperoxides at - 700 mV (vs. Ag wire/AgCl). Factors influencing the separation and detection processes were examined and optimized. The integrated microsystem offers rapid measurements (within 130 s) of these organic-peroxide compounds, down to micromolar levels. A highly stable response for repetitive injections (RSD 0. 35 - 3. 12 %; n = 12) reflects the negligible electrode passivation. Such a "lab-on-a-chip" device should be attractive for on-site analysis of organic peroxides, as desired for <b>environmental</b> <b>screening</b> and industrial monitoring...|$|R
