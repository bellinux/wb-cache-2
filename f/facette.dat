40|$|Optical {{memory and}} optical data storage {{will play a}} leading role in future {{multimedia}} applications. One component of the optical disk system is the optical pick-up. The aim of this project was the development of the basic technology for the fabrication of a new ultralight optical pick-up system based on integrated components on silicon. Using both microelectronic and optoelectronic components, the projected pick-up should meet the criteria of the industrial mass production. In order to guarantee an easily adjustable outcoupling of the laser light, our alternative pick-up concept uses micromechanically etched silicon <b>facettes.</b> A complete process technology for anisotropic wet etching of silicon <b>facettes</b> was developed. The design of the silicon motherboard was proposed. A set of different photomasks was fabricated. Within the project, the lithography and the pattern-transfer part were optimized down to lateral dimensions of 25 nm using modified multilayer-resist systems. The developed technology will be used for the fabrication of optical grids and holograms. Additionally, molds for imprinting of nanostructures can be performed by the developed techniques. For characterization of optical components a home made measurement technique was builted-up. According to the BMBF order dated from 0. 1. 04. 1997 this research project was stopped, because the cooperation agreement of the industrial partner company was withdrawn.

Its dimension is (n − 1) 2, it has n! vertices, and has n 2 facets (each facet is made up of all doubly stochastic matrices with a 0 in a specified entry) [9]. Many analogous polytopes have been studied which are subsets of Bn. In contrast, the alternating sign matrix polytope ASMn is formed by taking the convex hull of n-by-n alternating sign matrices, which is a set of matrices containing the permutations. Thus Bn is contained in ASMn. Definition 1. 1. Alternating sign matrices (ASMs) are square matrices with the following properties [7]...|$|R

The primary targets of interest groups are members of Congress (especially members of the HR & Senate powerful committees) accused of being bought by gifts and PAC contributions. But the methods (expertise, grassroots mobilization, media campaigns, gifts, campaign contributions and legal action) are also used by the President, public-interest groups and foreign firms and governments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A recent {{decrease}} in the George River caribou herd ecruitment was caused both by an increasing calf winter mortality since 1977 {{and an increase in}} their summer mortality since 1984. A reduction in pregnancy rate could also be partly responsible for a decline in gross recruitment. Evaluation of net recruitment shows that the rate of increase of the herd has been negative since 1984. The probable causes of the decline involve the negative effects and interrelation of various factors: decline of the physical condition of females, habitat deterioration on the current calving grounds (former summer range), increase in energy expendituI'es related to more extensive movements, delayed birth dates, increase in density within their range and especially on calving rounds, increase in wolf populations and exceptionally high snow accumulation during the 1980 - 81 winter.
