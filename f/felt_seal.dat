40|$|Based on the {{environment}} requirements in seaside there exists static and dynamic seal designing for the photoelectric Theodolite. Static seal designing emphatically includes the designing of o-ring size and mechanical property analysis of o-ring seal, which is difficult to adopt conventional dynamic seal to meet the requirements. According to practical application, {{the combination of the}} radial labyrinth seal and high quality <b>felt</b> <b>seal</b> are designed. The combination seal which better solves the seal problem of narrow radial size is a good way of dynamic seal. At the same time, there is engineering practice needing to proof the radial labyrinth seal. Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Optics and Electronics (IOE); Chinese Optical Society (COS...|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, {{where it is}} used as the glue or binder mixed with {{aggregate}} particles to create asphalt concrete. Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of roofing <b>felt</b> and for <b>sealing</b> flat roofs.|$|R
50|$|In {{managing}} M. rotundata for pollination, such methods as dichlorvos pest {{strips and}} ultraviolet lamps placed above liquid traps {{are effective in}} killing parasitoids but not harming M. rotundata. Other methods of preventing parasitoid invasion include physical barriers. For example, the presence of thick artificial cavities separating the exterior from the nest and application of a <b>felt</b> cloth <b>sealing</b> {{to the back of}} the nesting board prevents parasitoid access to the nest. Another way that pest are controlled is by opening up the nesting material and cleaning the cocoons.|$|R

Allan, who contributed {{to the war effort}} by “manufacturing <b>felt</b> gaskets for <b>sealing</b> tank components”, was {{inspired}} to create the toy after observing how much enjoyment children had taking the discarded and misshaped pieces of felt and sticking them to the backs of table mats.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, The Brain Train {{formed and}} was managed by Sunset Strip hipster Bud Mathis. They {{recorded}} one single [...] - [...] "Black Roses", written by Wolfe Dios [...] - [...] before changing their name to Clear Light and signing to Elektra Records. Guitarist Bob <b>Seal</b> <b>felt</b> the name {{should be changed}} {{to coincide with the}} single. Clear Light shared its name with a potent form of LSD, although Seal states the name came from his studies of Eastern philosophy. The Doors' producer Paul A. Rothchild took over management of the band.|$|R
5000|$|Greg Evans of Deadline.com {{described}} The Passion {{as being}} [...] "equal parts sermon and Super Bowl halftime show", and [...] "overstuffed with sincerity, good intentions and hammy musical performances, all melting {{into a big}} batch of goo faster than a chocolate bunny in the sun." [...] He noted that the production frequently switched between dramatic segments that were [...] "ruthlessly condensed and fully reliant on Perry's stagebound exposition", Trisha Yearwood [...] "ostensibly playing Mary" [...] by singing songs from the main stage, and coverage and interviews from the procession. Evans <b>felt</b> that <b>Seal's</b> performance of [...] "Mad World" [...] was the [...] "best musical moment" [...] of the special, and also noted that unlike many Passion productions, the crucifixion of Jesus was not visually depicted, and that it [...] "entirely avoided the Passion pitfalls of history, handing the 'give us Barabbas!' cries to the crowd rather than any scapegoated minority. It was the evening’s rare moment of restraint, and rather inspired." ...|$|R

Seal did not present it to {{producer}} Trevor Horn until the recording sessions for Seal II. In 2015, Seal said of the song: [...] "To be honest, I was never really that proud of it, though I like what Trevor did with the recording. He turned that tape from my corner into another 8 million record sales and my name became a household name." ...|$|R
50|$|The Sega Seal of Quality was an icon {{placed on}} the {{packaging}} of all video games that had Sega's official approval to be played on a Sega console system. Similarly to the Nintendo Seal of Quality, the intention was to avoid the mistakes {{that led to the}} North American video game crash of 1983 by ensuring games were compatible with the intended console system and to censor content <b>felt</b> inappropriate. The <b>seal</b> appeared on a video game's box and marketing as a means of informing the consumer that Sega had previewed the game before its release and had met a certain level of quality standard (including graphics, sound, challenge, and content appropriateness).|$|R
