50|$|At 18:39, the {{aircraft}} touched {{down on the}} runway at Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport but an electrical power failure at the airport {{at that very moment}} forced the crew to initiate a missed approach. Twenty-two seconds after the lights went off, the emergency generator jumped in and restored the runway lights. The pilot elected to remain VFR under an altitude of 240 m. At 18:43, the crew asked for permission to land while positioning for another approach. However, because another aircraft, a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747, was about to take off, air traffic control ordered the crew of Flight 345 to fly an <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> When, at 18:53, air traffic control attempted to establish contact with flight 345, it received no answer.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, {{aircraft}} at uncontrolled airports usually {{cross the}} airport at midfield at pattern altitude from the upwind side, turning onto the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> Although joining straight in downwind {{is also a}} possibility. [...] At controlled airports, the tower typically directs aircraft to join the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> base leg, or straight into the final leg.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{aircraft}} usually {{join the}} pattern at a 45° {{angle to the}} <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> and abeam midfield. Although aircraft may legally join the pattern at any point, the AIM clearly states that the only approved pattern entry is the 45.|$|R
50|$|Formula boards have {{excellent}} upwind and downwind ability, {{but are not}} as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and <b>downwind</b> <b>legs,</b> or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> A long {{level flight}} path {{parallel}} to {{but in the}} opposite direction of the landing runway. (Some consider it to have [...] "sub-legs" [...] of early, mid and late. Certainly a plane giving a position report of [...] "mid-downwind" [...] can be visually located easily.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Windglider used a 6.5 m2 sail but {{the use of}} {{a harness}} was not permitted. The {{daggerboard}} weighed around 4 kg and was carried over the sailor's shoulder during the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs.</b> The 1984 Olympic course of nine nautical miles put a premium on the competitors strength and fitness.|$|R
50|$|A {{technique}} {{used to make}} these boats ultra-light is balsa wood cored hulls. A criticism is that the boats need to be reefed in relatively lower winds, when heading to the wind. Proponents argue that the Santa Cruz more than makes up for this deficiency in the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> of a race.|$|R
50|$|This kind of race is most {{commonly}} run over {{one or more}} laps of a triangular course marked {{by a number of}} buoys. The course starts from an imaginary line drawn from a 'committee boat' to the designated 'starting' buoy or 'pin'. A number of warning signals are given telling the crews exactly how long until the race starts. The aim of each crew is to cross the start line at full speed exactly as the race starts. A course generally involves tacking upwind to a 'windward' marker or buoy. Then bearing away onto a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> to a second jibe marker. Next another jibe on a second <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> to the last mark which is called the 'downwind mark' (or 'leeward mark'). At this mark the boats turn into wind once again to tack to the finish line.|$|R
5000|$|Fast aircraft, {{for example}} {{military}} jets, may enter the pattern with a run-and-break (in the US, overhead maneuver or overhead break). The aircraft flies at speed along the final leg, {{and makes a}} sharp, high-G turn above midfield to lose speed and arrive on the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> at pattern altitude and in landing configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} circuit {{begins with a}} roll on the runway until the aircraft rotates (nose pitches up), a climb to 500 feet above runway/field elevation (AGL), a right or left climbing turn (depending on making either right hand or left hand circuits) to a course perpendicular to the runway, continuing to gain altitude to TPA (traffic pattern altitude) (typically 1000 feet AGL), followed by another right or left turn for a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> parallel to the runway, maintaining TPA. During the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> the pilot performs pre-landing checks, contacts the control tower requesting a full-stop landing, a touch-and-go, [...] "stop-and-go", or [...] "the option", and when cleared to land, descends to 800 feet AGL. After seeing {{the threshold of the}} runway at 45 degrees behind him/her, the pilot makes another descending left or right turn to 500 feet AGL. The pilot then turns on the last leg, the final approach at which time clearance to land or for a touch-and-go must be received.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found that the visual flight in weather conditions below minimums. Flight 150 was in a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> as the aircraft was on approach to the airport in fog. It is unknown why the air traffic controller {{did not tell the}} pilots of flight 150 to execute a missed approach or why the pilots themselves didn't execute a missed approach.|$|R
50|$|This {{change in}} {{technique}} for downwind racing has changed most dinghy racing {{to be much}} more competitive on the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> and resulted in a change of the international course shape from a traditional triangle to a trapezoid giving greater opportunity for increased upwind and straight downwind legs.In addition, downwind laser sailing can very easily result in a death roll where the boat rocks, flips and capsizes to windward.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the second episode, scientists and local government officials on April 9, 2008 ordered hundreds of people to evacuate from the Park and nearby villages because the sulfur dioxide concentration levels had reached a critical level and a hazardous vog plume <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> from the crater. The evacuation lasted two days.|$|R
25|$|Race six {{followed}} a familiar refrain, with Oracle {{ahead at the}} start and holding {{that lead to the}} bottom of the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> After rounding the mark 12 seconds behind, Team New Zealand once again took over sailing into the wind. The highest number of tacks seen thus far was unable to prevent the Kiwis from gaining 55 seconds during the third leg, and the 44 second lead at the top mark was extended to 47 seconds at the finish.|$|R
50|$|Investigators interviewed Captain Wu. Captain Wu Xinlu {{stated that}} as he {{observed}} {{the lights on the}} final approach course to Runway 36L, he saw neither the runway approach lights on the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> nor the circling guidance lights during the circling approach were on. According to the record of the automatic aeronautical light switching system, and the testimony from the Gimhae Tower duty chief, the runway, approach lights and circling guidance lights were on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|R

50|$|Unlike during launch, where {{coordination}} between multiple pilots is straightforward, landing involves more planning, because {{more than one}} pilot might have to land at the same time. Therefore, a specific traffic pattern has been established. Pilots line up into a position above the airfield and {{to the side of}} the landing area, which is dependent on the wind direction, where they can lose height (if necessary) by flying circles. From this position, they follow the legs of a flightpath in a rectangular pattern to the landing zone: <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> base leg, and final approach. This allows for synchronization between multiple pilots and reduces the risk of collisions, because a pilot can anticipate what other pilots around him are going to do next.|$|R
2500|$|Team New Zealand had port entry advantage, {{and were}} able to convert this into the leeward {{position}} at the start line and a lead around the reach mark. Oracle had a moment where both bows dipped into the water, slowing them to open some separation between the two boats. The first <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> saw both boats foiling at around , at times well within [...] of each other. Team New Zealand took the lead into the upwind third leg, but were unable to hold it.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was operating a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Wattay International Airport, Vientiane to Pakse International Airport, Pakse, Laos. The flight departed from Vientiane at 14:45 local time (07:45 UTC) {{and crashed into}} the Mekong River at 15:55 local time (08:55 UTC) while approaching Pakse for the second time, less than 6 km from the airport. The aircraft had already gone around once due to poor weather {{and was in the}} <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> for another approach when the aircraft impacted the nearby river.|$|R
25|$|Team New Zealand led off {{the line}} for race fifteen, but the leeward {{position}} of the Oracle Team USA boat allowed them to round the reach mark first. A huge <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> from the American boat saw them round the leeward gate 1 minute ahead of the Kiwis. They did not give up, {{and were able to}} cut Oracle's lead in half by the windward gate, but were unable to make {{up the rest of the}} gap. Oracle had their best day on the water yet, winning both races to bring the score to 5-8.|$|R
50|$|The {{measured}} {{wind velocity}} is taken at near sea level, {{and does not}} account for effects of wind gradient with reported true wind speed of 15 kn at mast head height of over 60 m. The measured sea-level wind direction shifted away from 180 degrees between the time of setting of the course and commencement of sailing of the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> by which time wind direction was reported to be at around 160 degrees. As such the ratio between downwind velocity made good and wind speed is an approximation only.|$|R
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|R
50|$|At 19:57, Funchal {{cleared the}} crew to descend to 3500 ft and {{informed}} them that the QNH was 1014.0 mb. Apparently, during the landing checklist, the crew forgot to set the altimeter to that value, and proceeded to the final 180° turn to the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> well below the correct altitude, losing sight of the runway lights. Relying only on instruments, the pilot descended below the 720 ft required during circling and reached the base leg below 200 ft, impacting the sea soon after that. At the time of impact, the altimeter was reading 500 ft. The aircraft had its landing gear down and the flaps were extended at 20 degrees.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight was}} being {{operated}} under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach, and landing at Wamena, {{because there was}} no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena. There was low cloud on the final approach track to Runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft was observed conducting a low altitude go-around over the runway: it then climbed to a low height along the extended centre-line to the south east, before making a right turn onto the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> of the circuit. As it began its second approach it hit Pikei Hill in Tengah Mountain at 07:43 local time (10:43 UTC). All on board were killed instantly.|$|R
50|$|The 822 ft tall hilllies between Interstate 5 to {{the east}} and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is mostly within the {{community}} of La Jolla where the northern and eastern slopes form a sharp escarpment along the Rose Canyon fault. The community of Pacific Beach is on the gentler southern slope. There are several radio and television transmitters located on the summit including KFMB-TV and KGTV, the CBS and ABC affiliates respectively. Commercial aircraft approaching San Diego from the direction of Los Angeles often use Mount Soledad as their point to start the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> of their approach to San Diego International Airport.|$|R
50|$|The A-Class {{design has}} over time converged {{to a single}} sail rig using a {{lightweight}} carbon mast of about 9 meters length and using lightweight pentex or Kevlar sailcloth. The hulls and beams are often made out of carbon fibre as well. This single sail rig (just a mainsail) allows these boats to truly excel when sailing upwind. Their lightweight and time tested sailing techniques make these boats very fast on reaches and <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> as well. They were often unbeatable on the race course and only {{with the introduction of}} the asymmetic spinnaker on other catamarans have they lost this position a little bit.|$|R
5000|$|On August 29, 1982, a Cessna 172 {{carrying}} a flight instructor and student pilot {{collided with a}} Cessna 150 flown by a student pilot. The control tower {{did not have a}} radar system installed at the time and had instructed the Cessna 172 to fly an overhead entry to the traffic pattern while the Cessna 150 was on its <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> The resulting collision sheared a wing off of the Cessna 172 and the ensuing crash resulted in the death of both occupants. The pilot of the other aircraft made a forced landing at the airport and skidded off the runway with the plane coming to rest on its nose.|$|R
50|$|Sailing off the wind, {{weather helm}} {{may be caused}} by the {{imbalance}} due to fore-and-aft sails all being sheeted out on the same (leeward) side of the boat. Raising a spinnaker or poling out a headsail to windward with a whisker pole can help. Yachts making ocean trade wind crossings have rigged 'twins' - double headsails poled out to opposite sides from the same forestay for <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> passages without a mainsail. Square rigged sails also provide relatively symmetric drive off the wind.|$|R
50|$|By tight coverage, {{the lead}} boat {{will attempt to}} stay as close as {{possible}} to its opponent while staying in front. For example, if on a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> the losing boat gybes towards the right side of the course the winning boat will gybe towards the right side of the course as well even though the left side of the course appears to be favored. That way the winning boat is insured against losing the lead due to a wind shift that favors the right side of the course. In fleet racing there will often be boats on both sides of the course, requiring the lead boat to sail on the side that it considers to be fastest.|$|R
25|$|Race three {{initially}} {{looked good}} for Oracle as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead {{for the first}} <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the upwind third leg. The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on port tack within three boat lengths of the boundary. Oracle was forced to tack away due to the boundary rights, {{even though they were}} on starboard which would have otherwise have had right of way. The 29 second lead at the top mark was held by the Kiwis {{all the way to the}} finish, crossing 28 seconds ahead of the Americans to go 0–3 up.|$|R
