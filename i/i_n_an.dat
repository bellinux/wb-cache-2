It was not without difficulty that such valuable services were spared for the deadly purpose of penetrating into Eastern Africa. All obstacles, however, were removed by their ceaseless and energetic efforts, who had fostered the author's plans, and early in the autumn of 1854, Lieut.

Recurrent networks with internal or extemal feedback {{have proven to be}} very useful as models or controllcrs for dynamical systems. Our system implements a recurrent multi-layer perceptron (RMLP), which may be regarded as a combined generalization of a feedforward MLP and a one-layer fully recurrent network. The neuroprocessor design was implemented using a single Xilinx Virtex FPGA and made extensive use of a variety of techniques; including intra-layer parallelism, inter-layer multiplexing, and fixed-point bit-serial based computational techniques to achieve extreme design compactness. Flexibility of the design was achieved by allowing the architecture to be on-the-fly programmable from RAM. The intra-layer architecture of the neuroprocessor was organized in a SIMD configuration. While the overall goal is to develop an inexpensive and commercially viable ASIC based on the FPGA IP core, we describe here our FPGA design implementation and the two challenging applications, misfire detection and engine idle speed control, that had served a s the focus for this effort. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Suppose that N inputs to a linear, time-invariant channel are {{designed}} to maximize the minimum L, distance between channel outputs. It is assumed that all inputs are zero outside the finite time window [- T, TI and are constrained in energy. The jointly optimal inputs and channel frequency response H(f) for which the minimum distance is maximized is studied, subject to the constraint that the L, norm of H(f) is bounded. This leads to an ellipse packing problem in which N- 1 axis lengths, which define an ellipse in RN-', and N points inside the ellipse are to be chosen to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between points, subject to the constraint that {{the sum of the}} squared axis lengths is constant. An optimality condition is derived, and it is conjectured that the optimal ellipse in which the N points must lie is an n-dimensional sphere, where n <b>I</b> <b>N.</b> <b>An</b> approximate volume calculation suggests that n increases as O(log N).
