5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the <b>incinerator</b> <b>room</b> where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E

5000|$|... "Mr. Big" [...] is said {{to haunt}} the halls of Friley through means of strange sounds and cool drafts. It is {{said that he was}} chased {{throughout}} the building by guards wearing a cape and a top hat from 1 a.m. until the guards lost his trace and were tired. They then looked through a small hole in the brick of an old, closed off <b>incinerator</b> <b>room.</b> They saw an outline of the man of his size wearing a cape and a top hat {{on the wall of the}} isolated room, and on the wall next to him [...] "I am Big" [...] was written.|$|E
40|$|Over 10, 000 {{airborne}} microorganisms, {{isolated from}} various areas of two hospitals, were characterized according to colonial and microscopic morphology and certain physiological reactions, including penicillin resistance and hemolysis. On {{the basis of}} all isolates examined during a 15 -month period, 42. 6 % were gram-positive cocci, 19. 2 % were gram-positive rods, 14. 0 % were gram-negative rods, 17. 1 % were molds, 2. 2 % were actinomycetes, 1. 2 % were yeasts, and the remainder were assorted diphtheroids and coccobacillary types. The distribution of types varied according to hospital area, locations within a given area, and level of gross airborne contamination, but did not vary significantly with season of the year. There appeared to be some relationship between contaminant particle size and type of organism associated with the particle. Distribution of penicillin-resistant types differed markedly in different hospital areas, with proportions ranging from 21. 4 % in surgery areas to 4. 3 % in <b>incinerator</b> <b>rooms.</b> Of all gram-positive cocci isolated, 34. 9 % were hemolytic, and 16. 4 % were penicillin-resistant...|$|R
5000|$|After visiting an {{apartment}} complex in Queens where a series of people had become sick with unusual rashes, Pomerantz inspected the site and discovered the mites near the building's <b>incinerator</b> <b>rooms</b> and reported his findings to health officials. Visiting the stricken Kew Gardens, Queens complex with physician Robert Huebner, the two peeled back wallpaper to find the walls swarming with mites, {{so much so that}} tenants had described that [...] "the walls had movement". Huebner's investigations on the site led to the conclusion that tenants had been bitten by a mite identified as Allodermanyssus sanguineus, found on mice that infested the storerooms and incinerator areas in the buildings. Pomerantz was credited with identifying this as a zoonotic disease spread through mice and the mites that infested them. After culturing and isolating the organism in laboratory mice, the pathogen they named Rickettsia akari was identified as the ultimate cause of the disease now called rickettsialpox. The Department of Health announced a program to work with building owners to exterminate the mice that were the vector for the disease. Over 500 cases of the disease were diagnosed in New York City from 1947 to 1951.|$|R
40|$|At about 1100 on July 2, 1980, a {{temperature}} rise above normal was recorded on charts monitoring {{operation of the}} <b>incinerator</b> in <b>Room</b> 149, Building 771. The plenum overheat alarm sounded at 1215, emergency actions initiated, and the fire was extinguished and mop-up began at about 1300. Investigation determined that {{the fire in the}} plenum was caused by a heat rise in the system, a deteriorated bypass valve on the No. 3 heat exchanger (KOH scrubber), nitration of the urethane seal on the HEPA filter media to the filter frame, and accumulation of metallic fines on the filter media. It was concluded that the management system responded properly, except for the ring- down system to activate the Emergency Operations Center...|$|R
50|$|From May 13, 2013 to June 2, 2013, Seabourn Quest was drydocked for a refit at the T. Mariotti {{shipyard}} in Genoa, Italy. Work on {{the ship}} included 2 new additional cranes in outdoor spaces aft deck 6, 4 additional Zodiac cradles, rearrangement of <b>incinerator</b> <b>room</b> and increasing of retention capacity, installation of a new water ballast treatment system in engine room and minor mechanical and piping works in engine room and drydock. Additional work included the ship’s marina being refitted to accommodate the Zodiac inflatables {{that will be used}} in Seabourn’s upcoming Antarctica cruises along with general upgrades and additions to the crew area that have already been introduced on the Seabourn Odyssey and Seabourn Sojourn. This refit had no implications for the vessel's ice class. The refit involved only minor modifications to accommodate the Zodiacs.|$|E

[...] A hipped, cross gabled roof tops the building. Its exterior ornamentation {{is found in the}} round-arch doorway with stained glass sidelights and transom; lintels and bands created from carved stone; and gables trimmed in stone containing round-arch windows and brick corbelling near the roofline. The main floor of the interior features a chapel, waiting area and office space. The cremation retorts (<b>incinerators)</b> and holding <b>room</b> are in the basement.|$|R
50|$|An area of 35 acre was {{acquired}} from the City of Alameda in 1939 {{with an additional}} 17 acre purchased by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1942. The entire island of 67 acre was devoted to training center facilities. The first contract provided for five barracks, mess hall and galley, engineering and administration buildings, an infirmary, roadways, heating, plumbing, electrical and fire protection. The contract was awarded February 21, 1942 and completed June 30, 1942 {{at a cost of}} $1,680,082.94. Additional contracts for another half million dollars provided for additional barracks, clothing issue building, paving a drill field, band <b>room,</b> <b>incinerator,</b> anti-aircraft trainer building, and docks for small boats.|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} economy {{can be achieved}} only by assessing processes finalized to optimize the use of resources. Waste can be a relevant source of energy thanks to energy-from-waste processes. Concerns regarding the toxic fly ashes can be solved by transforming them into resource as recycled materials. The commitment to recycle {{is driven by the}} need to conserve natural resources, reduce imports of raw materials, save landfill space and reduce pollution. A new method to stabilize fly ash from Municipal Solid Waste <b>Incinerator</b> (MSWI) at <b>room</b> temperature has been developed thanks to COSMOS-RICE LIFE+ project (www. cosmos-rice. csmt. eu). This process is based on a chemical reaction that occurs properly mixing three waste fly ashes with rice husk ash, an agricultural by-product. COSMOS inert can replace critical raw materials (i. e. silica, fluorspar, clays, bentonite, antimony and alumina) as filler. Moreover the materials employed in the stabilization procedure may be not available in all areas. This paper investigates the possibility of substituting silica fume with corresponding condensed silica fume and to substitute flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) residues with low-cost calcium hydroxide powder. The removal of coal fly ash was also considered. The results will be presented and a possible substitution of the materials to stabilize fly ash will be discussed...|$|R
