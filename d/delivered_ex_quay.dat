40|$|AbstractObjectiveMore than 50 % of aortocoronary {{saphenous vein}} grafts are {{occluded}} 10 years after surgery. Intimal hyperplasia is an initial, critical {{step in the}} progression toward occlusion. To date, no clinically relevant large animal models of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia have been fully characterized. Gene therapy holds promise as a novel treatment for aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia. The 2 objectives {{of this study are}} to characterize a canine model of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia and to demonstrate that ex vivo gene delivery is possible in these grafts using adenoviral vectors. MethodsTen dogs underwent aortocoronary bypass grafting using saphenous veins. Six dogs underwent serial arteriograms to monitor graft patency. On postoperative day 90, the dogs were killed and their grafted and nongrafted saphenous veins were studied histologically. Four dogs underwent the same procedure, but their saphenous veins were treated with 1 × 1012 total viral particles of a replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus containing β-galactosidase (n = 2) or the β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus (n = 2). These animals were killed on postoperative day 7 for determination of transgene expression. ResultsAll grafts were demonstrated patent by arteriogram before the animals were killed. The mean intimal area of the saphenous vein grafts was increased when compared with that of the nongrafted saphenous veins (2. 83 mm 2 vs 0. 09 mm 2, P <. 0008). Adenoviral-treated saphenous vein grafts demonstrated positive transgene expression either by X-gal staining (β-galactosidase) or Northern analysis (β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus). ConclusionThis study characterizes a clinically relevant canine model of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, it demonstrates that adenoviral vectors can be <b>delivered</b> <b>ex</b> vivo to the saphenous vein graft vessel wall at subphysiologic distension pressures. This model may be used in future studies to manipulate molecular targets critical in aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates empirically the {{performance}} of six structural credit risk models by comparing the probabilities of default (PDs) they <b>deliver</b> to <b>ex</b> post default rates. In contrast to previous studies pursuing similar objectives, the paper employs firm-level data and finds that theory-based PDs tend to match closely the actual level of credit risk and to account for its time path. At the same time, nonmodelled macro variables from the financial and real sides of the economy help to substantially improve the forecasts of default rates. The finding suggests that theory-based PDs fail to fully reflect the dependence of credit risk on the business and credit cycles. Most of the upbeat conclusions regarding {{the performance}} of the PDs are due to models with endogenous default. For their part, frameworks that assume exogenous default tend to underpredict credit risk. Three borrower characteristics influence materially the predictions of the models: the leverage ratio; the default recovery rate; and the risk-free rate of return.

40|$|Lentiviral vectors (LVs) {{have emerged}} as potent and {{versatile}} vectors for ex vivo or in vivo gene transfer into dividing and nondividing cells. Robust phenotypic correction of diseases in mouse models has been achieved paving the way toward the first clinical trials. LVs can <b>deliver</b> genes <b>ex</b> vivo into bona fide stem cells, particularly hematopoietic stem cells, allowing for stable transgene expression upon hematopoietic reconstitution. They are also useful to generate induced pluripotent stem cells. LVs can be pseudotyped with distinct viral envelopes that influence vector tropism and transduction efficiency. Targetable LVs can be generated by incorporating specific ligands or antibodies into the vector envelope. Immune responses toward the transgene products and transduced cells can be repressed using microRNA-regulated vectors. Though there are safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis, their integration profile seems more favorable than that of γ-retroviral vectors (γ-RVs). Moreover, {{it is possible to}} minimize this risk by modifying the vector design or by employing integration-deficient LVs.

Assay of joint lavages confirmed the in vivo expression of biologically active human IRAP. With allografted cells, IRAP expression was lost by 12 days after transfer. In contrast, autografted synoviocytes continued to express IRAP for approximately 5 weeks. Knee joints expressing human IRAP were protected from the leukocytosis that otherwise follows the intraarticular injection of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta. Thus, we report the intraarticular expression and activity of a potentially therapeutic protein by gene-transfer technology; these experiments demonstrate the feasibility of treating arthritis and other joint disorders with gene therapy...|$|R

Exploiting the concept of extremal transfers allows us to obtain an exact characterization of the set of all implementable allocation rules (the set of transfers is non-empty) and the set of allocation rules satisfying Revenue Equivalence (the extremal transfers coincide). Furthermore, we show how the extremal transfers can be put to use in mechanism design problems where Revenue Equivalence does not hold. To this end we rst explore the role of extremal transfers when the agents with type dependent outside options are free to participate in the mechanism. Finally, we consider the question of budget balanced implementation.

40|$|In {{cases of}} craniosynostosis, {{defined as the}} {{premature}} fusion of the cranial sutures, {{there is a need}} to inhibit bone formation in small calvarial defects to avoid the occurrence of postoperative resynostosis. Similarly, reconstruction of bone in the craniofacial skeleton following injury or tumor resection necessitates controlled bone regeneration to avoid bone overgrowth. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent bone inducing growth factors that are expressed during normal bone healing. Noggin is an extracellular antagonist to BMPs. This work studied the use of Noggin to prevent postoperative resynostosis in a rabbit model of human nonsyndromic craniosynostosis via protein therapy. A mouse model of a healing suturectomy was also developed. This model was used to study the effects of Noggin ex vivo gene therapy on the inhibition of postoperative resynostosis. Finally, the ability of Noggin to inhibit bone overgrowth and improve BMP 4 -induced bone formation was tested. The work presented here demonstrates that a single dose of Noggin protein is capable of inhibiting resynostosis and improving craniofacial growth after surgery to correct craniosynostosis in rabbits. Noggin <b>delivered</b> through <b>ex</b> vivo gene therapy was able to inhibit bone formation in a novel mouse model. Also, the implantation of Noggin expressing cells along with BMP 4 expressing cells reduced ectopic bone formation and improved bone density.

Furthermore, by recreating naturally occurring expression patterns (for example, both Noggin and BMP 4), we may be able to control the size, shape and quality of bone formed by biologically-driven therapies...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traumatic {{articular}} cartilage injuries heal poorly and may predispose patients {{to the early}} onset of osteoarthritis. One current treatment relies on surgical delivery of autologous chondrocytes that are prepared, prior to implantation, through ex vivo cell expansion of cartilage biopsy cells. The requirement for cell expansion, however, is both complex and expensive and {{has proven to be}} amajor hurdle in achieving awidespread adoption of the treatment. This studypresents evidence that autologous chondrocyte implantation can be <b>delivered</b> without requiring <b>ex</b> vivo cell expansion. The proposed improvement relies on mechanical fragmentation of cartilage tissue sufficient to mobilize embedded chondrocytes via increased tissue surface area. Our outgrowth study,whichwasused todemonstrate chondrocytemigrationandgrowth, indicated that fragmented cartilage tissue is a rich source for chondrocyte redistribution. The chondrocytes outgrown into 3 -D scaffolds also formed cartilage-like tissue when implanted in SCID mice. Direct treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in goats using cartilage fragments on a resorbable scaffold produced hyaline-like repair tissue at 6 months. Thus, delivery of chondrocytes in the form of cartilage tissue fragments in conjunction with appropriate polymeric scaffolds provides a novel intraoperative approach for cell-based cartilage repair. 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Bidirectional {{trafficking}} {{of cells}} between {{the mother and}} the fetus is routine in pregnancy and a component of maternal-fetal tolerance. Changes in fetal-to-maternal cellular trafficking have been reported in prenatal complications, but maternal-to-fetal trafficking has never been studied in the context of fetal intervention. We hypothesized that patients undergoing open fetal surgery would have altered maternal-fetal cellular trafficking. Methods: Cellular trafficking was analyzed in patients with myelomeningocele (MMC) who underwent open fetal surgical repair (n = 5), patients with MMC who had routine postnatal repair (n = 6), and healthy control healthy patients (n = 9). As an additional control for the fetal operation, trafficking was also analyzed in patients who were <b>delivered</b> by an <b>ex</b> utero intrapartum treatment procedure (n = 6). Microchimerism in maternal and cord blood was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonshared alleles. Results: Maternal-to-fetal trafficking was significantly increased in patients who underwent open fetal surgery for MMC compared with healthy controls, patients who underwent postnatal MMC repair, and patients who underwent ex utero intrapartum treatment. There were no differences in fetal-to-maternal cell trafficking among groups. Conclusion: Patients undergoing open fetal surgery for MMC have elevated levels of maternal microchimerism. These results suggest altered trafficking and/or increased proliferation of maternal cells in fetal blood and may have important implications for preterm labor. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} {{suspended}} sediment (SS) pose risks to chemical and ecological water quality. Agricultural activities may accelerate erosional fluxes from bare, poached or compacted soils, and enhance connectivity through modified channels and artificial drainage networks. Storm-event fluxes dominate SS transport in agricultural catchments; therefore, high temporal-resolution monitoring approaches are required, {{but can be}} expensive and technically challenging. Here, the performance of in situ turbidity sensors, conventionally installed submerged at the river bankside, is compared with installations where river water is <b>delivered</b> to sensors <b>ex</b> situ, i. e. within instrument kiosks on the riverbank, at two experimental catchments (Grassland B and Arable B). The in situ and ex situ installations gave comparable results when calibrated against storm-period, depth-integrated SS data, with total loads at Grassland B estimated at 12 800 and 15 400 t, and 22 600 and 24 900 t at Arable B, respectively. The absence of spurious turbidity readings relating to bankside debris around the in situ sensor and its greater security make the ex situ sensor more robust. The ex situ approach was then used to characterise SS dynamics and fluxes in five intensively managed agricultural catchments in Ireland which feature a range of landscape characteristics and land use pressures. Average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was below the Freshwater Fish Directive (78 / 659 /EEC) guideline of 25 mg L − 1, and the continuous hourly record demonstrated that exceedance occurred less than 12 % of the observation year. Soil drainage class and proportion of arable land were key controls determining flux rates, but all catchments reported {{a high degree of}} inter-annual variability associated with variable precipitation patterns compared to the long-term average. Poorly drained soils had greater sensitivity to runoff and soil erosion, particularly in catchments with periods of bare soils. Well drained soils were less sensitive to erosion even on arable land; however, under extreme rainfall conditions, all bare soils remain a high sediment loss risk. Analysis of storm-period and seasonal dynamics (over the long term) using high-resolution monitoring would be beneficial to further explore the impact of landscape, climate and land use characteristics on SS export...|$|R
