5000|$|Laboratory animals (mammals, e.g. mice) {{are first}} {{exposed to the}} antigen that an {{antibody}} is to be generated against.

Once splenocytes are isolated from the mammal's spleen, the B cells are fused with immortalised myeloma cells. The fusion of the B cells with myeloma cells can be done using electrofusion. Electrofusion causes the B cells and myeloma cells to align and fuse with the application of an electric field. Alternatively, the B-cells and myelomas can be made to fuse by chemical protocols, most often using polyethylene glycol. The myeloma cells are selected beforehand to ensure they are not secreting antibody themselves and that they lack the <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) gene, making them sensitive to the HAT medium (see below).|$|E
50|$|The optic nerves of the eye, {{accessed}} {{through the}} eyelid, and olfactory nerves {{of the nose}} provide a direct pathway to {{the central nervous system}} for the neurotropic Cobra virus to spread along, where the virus takes root. Once present in brain matter, the virus begins to replicate exponentially faster. Infected brain cells experience growth of viral crystals in their nuclei, eventually leading to lysis of the cell. The brain stem, the area of the brain that controls the basic functions of life, is heavily affected by this growth. The Cobra virus also knocks out the gene for the enzyme <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), whose absence causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. As a result, patients experience both autocannibalistic urges, and increased aggression towards others. These neurological symptoms develop and progress incredibly quickly, going from neurologically asymptomatic to full blown within a matter of several hours, eventually resulting in death due to the severe damages to the brain stem. Cobra is so aggressive in its growth that autopsies reveal a brain almost liquified by the extensive cell lysis.|$|E

40|$|Chlamydiae {{have evolved}} a biphasic life cycle to {{facilitate}} their survival in two discontinuous habitats. The unique growth cycle {{is represented by}} two alternating forms of the organism, the elementary body and the reticulate body. Chlamydiae have an absolute nutritional dependency on the host cell to provide ribonucleoside triphosphates and other essential intermediates of metabolism. This report describes the pleiotropic effects of the purine antimetabolite 6 -thioguanine on chlamydial replication. In order to display cytotoxicity, 6 -thioguanine must first be converted to the nucleotide level by the host cell enzyme <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase. Our results show that 6 -thioguanine is an effective inhibitor of chlamydial growth with either wild-type or <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cell lines as the host. Interestingly, the mechanism of 6 -thioguanine-induced inhibition of chlamydial growth is different depending on which cell line is used. With wild-type cells as the host, the cytotoxic effects of 6 -thioguanine on chlamydial growth are relatively fast and irreversible. Under these circumstances, cytotoxicity likely results from the combined effect of starving chlamydiae for purine ribonucleotides and incorporation of host-derived 6 -thioguanine-containing nucleotides into chlamydial nucleic acids. With <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells as the host, 6 -thioguanine must be present {{at the start of}} the chlamydial infection cycle to be effective and the growth inhibition is reversible upon removal of the antimetabolite. These findings suggest that in <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells, the free base 6 -thioguanine may inhibit the differentiation of elementary bodies to reticulate bodies. With <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells as the host, 6 -thioguanine was used as a selective agent in culture to isolate a Chlamydia trachomatis isolate resistant to the effects of the drug. This drug resistant C. trachomatis isolate was completely resistant to 6 -thioguanine in <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells; however, it displayed wildtype sensitivity to 6 -thioguanine when cultured in wild-type host cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the basis for the}} recently reported, but unexplained deficiency of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase) in the erythrocytes of patients with genetic deficiencies of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase. We found that a hemolysate from a patient with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency had only 7 % of control AdoHcyase activity, conforming the original observation. Of the purine nucleosides known to accumulate in nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patients, inosine alone caused the phosphate-dependent, irreversible inactivation of purified human placental AdoHcyase, and of AdoHcyase in intact erythrocytes and cultured lymphoblastoid cells. Hypoxanthine did not inactivate purified AdoHcyase, but potentiated the effect of inosine in intact <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient human lymphoblastoid cells. This presumably resulted from the ability of hypoxanthine to shift the equilibrium of the nucleoside phosphorylase reaction, preventing inosine breakdown. This could account for the partial AdoHcyase deficiency reported in <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient patients. We have also demonstrated the AdoHycase-catalyzed synthesis of S-inosylhomocysteine from inosine and L-homocysteine, a reaction which may occur in nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of reduced purine salvage to the hyperuricemia associated with <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency {{was measured by}} the intravenous administration of tracer doses of [8 - 14 C]adenine to nine patients with normal enzyme activity, three patients with a partial deficiency of <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase, and six patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The mean cumulative excretion of radioactivity 7 d after the adenine administration is 5. 6 ± 2. 4, 12. 9 ± 0. 9, and 22. 3 ± 4. 7 % of infused radioactivity for control subjects, partial <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient subjects, and Lesch-Nyhan patients, respectively. To assess relative rates of nucleotide degradation in control and <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient patients two separate studies were employed. With [8 - 14 C]inosine administration, three control subjects excreted 3. 7 - 8. 5 % and two enzyme-deficient patients excreted 26. 5 - 48. 0 % of the injected radioactivity in 18 h. The capacity of the nucleotide catabolic pathway to accelerate in response to d-fructose was evaluated in control and enzyme-deficient patients. The normal metabolic response to intravenous fructose is a 7. 5 ± 4. 2 -mmol/g creatinine increase in total urinary purines during the 3 -h after the infusion. The partial <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient subjects and Lesch-Nyhan patients show increases of 18. 6 ± 10. 8 and 17. 3 ± 11. 8 mmol/g creatinine, respectively. Of the observed rise in purine exretion in control subjects, 40 % occurs from inosine excretion and 32 % occurs from oxypurine excretion. The rise in total purine excretion with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is almost entirely accounted for by an elevated uric acid excretion. Increases in urine radioactivity after fructose infusion are distributed in those purines that are excreted in elevated quantities...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutation}} {{in a young}} gouty male with a partial deficiency of <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase has been evaluated. The serum uric acid was 11. 8 mg/ 100 ml, and the urinary uric acid excretion was 1, 279 mg/ 24 h. Erythrocyte <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase was 34. 2 nmol/h/mg, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was 36. 5 nmol/h/mg and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate was 2. 6 muM. <b>Hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase from peripheral leukocytes and cultured diploid skin fibroblasts was within the normal range, but enzyme activity in rectal mucosa was below the normal range. Initial velocity studies of the normal enzyme and the mutant enzyme from erythrocytes with the substrates hypoxanthine, guanine, or phosphoribosylpyrophosphate showed that the Michaelis constants were similar. Product inhibition studies distinguished the mutant enzyme from the normal enzyme. Hyperbolic kinetics with increasing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate were converted to sigmoid kinetics by 0. 2 mM GMP with the mutant enzyme {{but not with the}} normal enzyme. The mutant erythrocyte <b>hypoxanthine-guanine</b> phosphoribosyltransferase was inactivated normally at 80 degrees C and had a normal half-life in the peripheral circulation. The mol wt of 48, 000 was similar to the normal enzyme mol wt of 47, 000. With isoelectric focusing, the mutant erythrocyte enzyme had two major peaks with isoelectric pH's of 5. 50 and 5. 70, in contrast to the isoelectric pH's of 5. 76, 5. 82, and 6. 02 of the normal isozymes. Isoelectric focusing of leukocyte extracts from the patient revealed the presence of the mutant enzyme. Cultured diploid fibroblasts from the propositus appeared to function normally, as shown by the inability to grow in 50 - 100 muM azaguanine and by the normal incorporation of [14 C]hypoxanthine into nucleic acid. In contrast, erythrocytes from the patient displayed abnormal properties, including the increased synthesis of phosphoribosylphyrophosphate and elevated functional activity of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylic decarboxylase.
