His character is named after Gotee Records co-founder Joey Elwood, a real-life music producer whose name Kubo thought fit Elwood's character design perfectly. Elwood has great talent with throwing knives, and is ingenious in combat, but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and measure up to the abilities of his superhuman partners. Smith and <b>Gamma</b> both see Elwood as a younger version of <b>Gamma,</b> which fills <b>Gamma</b> with hope and pride, but also the fear that Elwood may turn to evil.

Another Eggman robot, E-102 <b>Gamma,</b> orders Amy to give the bird to him; she refuses, asking him why he wants it.

40|$|For the in vivo range {{verification}} in proton therapy, it {{has been}} tried to measure the spatial distribution of the prompt <b>gammas</b> generated by the proton-induced interactions with the {{close relationship with the}} proton dose distribution. However, the high energy of the prompt <b>gammas</b> and background <b>gammas</b> are still problematic in measuring the distribution. In this study, we suggested a new method determining the in vivo range by utilizing the time structure of the prompt <b>gammas</b> formed with the rotation of a range modulation wheel (RMW) in the passive scattering proton therapy. To validate the Monte Carlo code simulating the proton beam nozzle, axial percent depth doses (PDDs) were compared with the measured PDDs with the varying beam range of 4. 73 - 24. 01 cm. And the relationship between the proton dose rate and the time structure of the prompt <b>gammas</b> was assessed and compared in the water phantom. The results of the PDD showed accurate agreement within the relative errors of 1. 1 % in the distal range and 2. 9 % in the modulation width. Average dose difference in the modulation was assessed as less than 1. 3 % by comparing with the measurement. The time structure of prompt <b>gammas</b> was well-matched within 0. 39 ms with the proton dose rate, and this could enable the accurate prediction of the in vivo range.
