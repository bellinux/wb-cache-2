5|$|In nearby West Bengal in India, the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> {{was largely}} disputed between {{government}} agencies and news agencies, with the former generally indicating lower figures. While the Kolkata Police Force initially reported 210deaths, various news agencies suggested that the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> was around 500. Ultimately, the official <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> in West Bengal reached 538. In addition to human casualties, the cyclone also killed 57,604 heads of cattle. The damage in West Bengal totaled US$13million.|$|E
5|$|The exact <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> was unknown, but {{believed}} to be several hundred. About {{two days after the}} storm, the official <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> was more than 80. By three days after the storm, the toll rose to 190, and by four days after it made landfall, the official total was 290deaths; officials estimated the toll could have exceeded 500. Due to downed communications, reports of storm fatalities were slow to spread, though news became more rapid as links were repaired. On November19, a week after the storm struck, the Mexican Army set the final <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> at 436deaths, with 300missing; the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> was later reported by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in 1993. Overall, Hurricane Tara was the deadliest disaster in 1961, as well as the third deadliest Mexico Pacific hurricane on record, after a hurricane in 1959 and Hurricane Liza in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two days}} after the storm, the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> rose to 18; the next day, the Associated Press {{reported}} 52deaths and 102injuries.

5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> reached 464. Ultimately, the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm. In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Europe {{had more}} than 40 million refugees, its economy had {{collapsed}} and 70 percent of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Between twelve and fourteen million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from east-central Europe to Germany. During the Cold War, the West German government estimated a <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> of 2.2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion of Germans and through forced labour in the Soviet Union. This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. In 2006, the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Ikuhiko Hata also {{examined}} the Japanese Army's documents and tallied up {{a total of}} 30,000 Chinese POWs massacred {{out of a total}} Chinese force of 100,000. Hata takes Smythe's figure of 12,000 civilians killed, but notes that perhaps only 8,000 were confirmed massacre victims. Hata discounts estimates of the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> which range into the hundreds of thousands on the basis that, according to Smythe, Nanking's civilian population was only between 200,000 and 250,000. In light of the 40,000 corpses which Hata believes were buried in and around Nanking, he estimates the total <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> at between 38,000 and 42,000 POWs and civilians.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} {{hours of the}} rioting, state media only {{reported}} that three people had been killed.

In the following days the <b>death</b> <b>toll</b> reported by various government sources (including Xinhua and party officials) gradually grew, with the last official update on 18 July placing the tally at 197 dead, 1,721 injured.

Estimates of the deaths in Mexico, where records are less complete, vary more widely.

Monetary damage figures are not available, but it is known that flooding from Alice caused considerable damage to crops, primarily cotton.|$|E
