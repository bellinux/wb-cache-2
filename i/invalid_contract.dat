40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo discorrer sobre as formas de manutenção e retirada dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Ao se partir da premissa de que um contrato administrativo, tal como qualquer outro ato jurídico, introduz normas jurídicas no sistema jurídico-positivo, será preciso antes de tudo saber quando uma norma existe para o ordenamento jurídico, bem como quando ela será considerada válida ou inválida. Além disso, será importante apontar o sentido do termo eficácia. Em seguida, indicar-se-á o conceito de contrato administrativo a ser adotado neste trabalho, procurando analisá-lo a partir dos elementos e pressupostos do ato administrativo, o que se revelará bastante útil ao se estudar a convalidação dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Depois de se apresentar o conceito de invalidade e suas espécies no direito brasileiro, abordar-se-á as hipóteses de manutenção, no direito positivo, dos contratos administrativos inválidos, quais sejam, a convalidação, a conversão e o saneamento.

A composition rule, inspired by the Compositon Theorem, is formulated in a semantics based on timed streams. A subset of the Specification and Decription Language (SDL) is defined and the SDL subset is formalized in the semantics. A simplification of the testing strategy was realized in an experimental prototype tool for testing of contract decompositions in SDL. In addition another prototype tool based on a conventional strategy was built as a reference tool.

Radi boljeg razumijevanja i snalaženja u zakonskoj normativi o ugovorima i posebno o otuđenju koje je posebna vrsta ugovora, autor je za svaki kanon dao posebni naslov. U kan. 1290. donesen je opći propis o ugovorima gdje se kaže da se o njima trebaju obdržavati građanski zakoni s istim učincima kao i kanonsko pravo, osim ako je u kanonskom pravu određeno što drugačije ili ako se ne protive božanskom pravu; u kan. 1291 - 1296. crkveni je zakonodavac donio posebnu crkvenu disciplinu o otuđenju crkvenih vremenitih dobara; kan. 1297. govori o davanju posebnog dopuštenja napismeno upraviteljima crkvenih pravnih osoba nakon što oni prije izvrše zakonski propisane predradnje kako bi uopće mogli crkvena dobra veće vrijednosti dati u zakup; posebni je propis kan. 1298. u kojemu se zabranjuje, bez napisanog dopuštenja mjerodavne vlasti, tj. bez napisanog dopuštenja mjerodavne vlasti: upraviteljima samima sebi kao i njihovim rođacima u krvnom i tazbinskom srodstvu do četvrtoga koljena (stupnja) uključivo nije dopušteno prodati ili davati u zakup crkvena vremenita dobra, osim ako se radi o stvarima vrlo male vrijednosti. Hrvatska biskupska konferencija kaže da dopuštenje davanja u zakup i prodaju nekretnina daje mjesni ordinarij. Tu se još ostalo na propisu iz CIC 1917. kan. 1540., dok je u važećem Zakoniku iz 1983. u kan. 1298. propisano da pisano dopuštenje daje za davanje u zakup i prodaju mjerodavna vlast, što u pojedinim slučajevima nije isto. In {{this work}} {{the author has}} treated Title III. Book V. of the Code from 1983. can. 1290 - 1298 “Contracts and A {{alienation}} Separately”; the work is founded on the sources and literature; in the treatment the author has applied legal-exegetic method, and he has also applied can. 17 of the Code from 1983. on understanding the church laws. Church legislator accepts the secular laws {{if they are in}} accordance with the divine law or unless something else is determined by the canon law; thus, at judicial proceedings and in contracts, argumentation by means of witnesses, under the lead of the judge (can. 1547), is allowed. At the abalienation of temporal church goods or temporal goods of public church corporations, particularities from can. 1291 - 1296 should be observed. Regular administrators of church corporations can, {{in the name of the}} corporation, alienate only those church goods for which permission of the competent church authority is not specified (working capital). When dealing with the basic property of a corporation, church laws require some legal formalities that differ from civil laws. In such cases, especially when legal formalities are required, written permission is needed by which the competent church authority permits the alienation of church goods, and it is condition for valid alienation, sale or lease. The aim of church laws is not to harm the property of the corporation. Because of the illegal procedure at alienation, sale or lease of temporal goods, the competent church authority is obliged to punish the offender by just punishment. If the contract on alienation, sale or lease of the church temporal goods was concluded by an incompetent person or if the subject of contract was forbidden or if the parties would not agree, or if there would be no reason for alienation, sale or lease, then such a contract would be invalid because some of the constitutive elements of the contract required by the canon law would be missing. In the cases when the validity of contract is accepted by the secular authorities but not by the church laws, the competent church authority should wisely decide, with help of experts, what to do without endangering the property of the church corporation. Anyway, church temporal goods have to be legally protected, and if the administrator of church temporal goods concluded illegal and <b>invalid</b> <b>contract</b> on alienation, sale or lease of church property, the church authority would be obliged to punish the offender by indefinite punishment...|$|E

Changes concern both defects and remedies. Along with traditional defects provided for by the civil code (i. e. incapacity, mistake, duress, and fraudolent misrepresentation), new rules have introduced protections to safeguard the weak contracting party’s carefulness, freedom and information. New duties to inform are placed on businesses in contracts negotiated away from business premises; distance selling, distance selling of financial services, and timeshare contracts; contracts for the purchase of package holidays; consumer credit, and electricity and gas supply contracts, {{as well as in the}} labelling of non-food products, and in the sale of dangerous products. New consent defects may be found in contracts concluded by the consumer in pending suits of violations to antitrust regulations. New bans on deceptive or aggressive commercial practices impose businesses to behave according to general principles of fair dealing and good faith from the very pre-contractual phase. The European contract law draftings confirm the extension of protections warranting the integrity of consent. In order to establish the nature and scope of the possible protection remedies, a coordination with the civil code rules applying to <b>invalid</b> <b>contracts</b> was needed.

50|$|The {{issue on}} appeal was whether a {{question}} of federal law {{was involved in the}} Minnesota Supreme Court's decision. Justice Sutherland, writing for a unanimous court, held that whether a federal question existed was irrelevant, because where there is an independent question of state law which is adequate to support the state court's judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. The severability of a contractual clause was an issue of state law, and the invalidity of the arbitration clause had already been determined by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Paramount case. The state court's determination of the non-severability of the unlawful clause was thus adequate to render the <b>contract</b> <b>invalid,</b> and was independent of any question of federal law.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are certain}} {{standards}} for proof {{that must be}} met in Islamic law for zina punishment to apply. In the Shafii, Hanbali, and Hanafi law schools Rajm (public stoning) or lashing is imposed for religiously prohibited sex only if the crime is proven, either by four male adults witnessing at first hand the actual sexual intercourse {{at the same time}} or by self-confession. For the establishment of adultery, four male Muslim witnesses must have seen the act in its most intimate details. Shia Islam allows substitution of one male Muslim with two female Muslims, but requires {{that at least one of}} the witnesses be a male. The Sunni Maliki school of law consider pregnancy in an unmarried woman as sufficient evidence of zina, unless there is evidence of rape or compulsion. However, the punishment can be averted by a number of legal [...] "semblances" [...] (shubuhat), such as existence of an <b>invalid</b> marriage <b>contract</b> or possibility that the conception predates a divorce. The majority Maliki opinion theoretically allowed for a pregnancy lasting up to seven years, indicating a concern of the jurists to shield women from the charge of zina and to protect children from the stigma of illegitimacy.

The fired Nucleus team goes to work for Endframe, and manage to set up a rival product to Pied Piper, which Gavin purchases for $250 million oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is hiring back the programmers he just fired. Big Head uses his $20 million to set up his own Incubator under-cutting Erlich, so Erlich partners with him and then exploits Big Heads's lack of business savvy to take control. However, because of Big Head and Erlich's spending habits (including a multimillion-dollar Luau on Alcatraz) they declare bankruptcy, and Erlich is forced to sell his stake in Pied Piper to repay the debts.
