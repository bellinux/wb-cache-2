40|$|Suretyship and {{financial}} guarantee - abstract As {{a topic of}} my Thesis I chose two civil and earlier also business law institutes Suretyship and Financial guarantee. I have analyzed the actual meaning of the <b>debt</b> <b>security</b> and its legal instruments in first part of my paper. There was {{a significant change in}} the Czech legal order since the new civil code came into power. Before the change, the institute of Suretyship was referred to in the "old" civil code Law no. 40 / 1960 Coll. for civil right purposes and in business code Law no. 513 / 1991 Coll. for business law purposes. After the recodification of private law, all legal obligations are now jointly in the "new" civil code Law no. 89 / 2012 Coll. The second part of my paper was dedicated to an analysis of this change and its impact. I went thru the effective legal treatment of the <b>debt</b> <b>security,</b> explained the effective <b>debt</b> <b>security</b> legal system in the civil code (analyzed the general provisions joint for all security institutes) in the next chapter. Furthemore, I dealt with the first of the security institutes being the topic - suretyship.

25|$|Critics {{maintain}} that this rating, outlooking, and watching of securities {{has not worked}} nearly as smoothly as agencies suggest.

These include the 1970 Penn Central bankruptcy, the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the 1994 Orange County default, the Asian and Russian financial crises, the 1998 collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, the 2001 Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies, and especially the 2007–8 subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

25|$|On 1 August 2012, France {{introduced}} a financial transaction tax in French tax regulation pursuant to Article 5 of the French Amended Finance Bill of 14 March 2012. Two other taxes applicable to financial transactions were also introduced, including {{a tax on}} high-frequency trading, (Article 235 ter ZD bis of the FTC); and a tax on naked sovereign credit default swaps (Article 235 ter ZD ter of the FTC). The FTT levies a 0.2% tax on stock purchases of French publicly traded companies with a market value over €1 billion. The scheme does not include <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> except convertible and exchangeable bonds, which are included but benefit from a dedicated exemption to the FTT. According to French president Francois Hollande the tax will generate €170 million in additional revenue for 2012 and another €500 million in 2013. France is the first European country to impose a transaction tax on share purchases. From 2 January 2017 settlement date the rate increased to 0.3%.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the real economy (producing goods and services) and the financial economy (trading assets). Some argue, like Marx did, that the tendency of the rate of profit to fall applies only to the sphere of the capitalist industrial production of commodities, not to the whole capitalist economy. Thus, it is argued, it is eminently possible that while industrial profitability stagnates, average profitability in activities external to the sphere of industrial production increases. In fact, Michael Hudson claims that in the United States, only about a quarter of workers' gross wages is spent on the purchase of actual goods and services. All the rest is spent on the payment of rents and mortgages, retirement schemes and insurance, loans and interest, and various taxes Costas Lapavitsas adds to this insight that not just household liabilities, but also household assets have to be looked at: the rich 20% of the world's workers have substantial deposits and savings invested with banks and retirement funds, so that, {{on both sides of the}} ledger, they become fully dependent on finance capital. Since labor incomes rose strongly in rich countries along with population growth in the second half of the 20th century, very large savings became available in retirement funds, representing an additional source of capital invested for profit worldwide and increasing the economic power of the finance industry. In 2008, the world's total tradeable financial assets (stocks, <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> and bank deposits) were estimated at $178 trillion, more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. In June 2017, the world's total public and private debt was estimated at US$217 trillion, again more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. If one assumes a grand-average net profit rate of 5% on this global debt, the profit made from global debt is roughly equal to the annual national income of China. This has created a world in industrialized countries that is very different from the orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist analysis of the commodity, where workers simply exchange their commodity labor power for a wage to buy a bundle of consumable commodities with.|$|E
