40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the optimum activation conditions for one- and two-bath pretreatments of <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> with α-amylase and pectinase, the weight loss was measured after treatments at different pH, temperature, soak time, and pectinase concentration. In addition, {{the surfaces of}} the enzyme- and alkali-pretreated hemp fabrics were studied, and the pectin content, tensile strength, moisture absorption rate, and whiteness index were analyzed and compared. In the two-bath pretreatment, the optimum pectinase activation conditions after desizing using α-amylase were pH 9, 50 oC, 120 min soak time, and a pectinase concentration of 30 %. In the one-bath pretreatment with a 1 % α-amylase addition and a pectinase concentration of 30 %, the optimum conditions were pH 8, 50 oC, and 80 min. The weight loss of the one-bath enzyme-pretreated <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> {{was similar to that}} of the alkali-pretreated fabric, and smaller than that of the two-bath enzyme-pretreated fabric.

40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘environmental awareness’ has {{recently}} had {{a major impact on}} the textile industry and on the fashion world as well. In this context, the use of natural fibres and the development of natural dyeing processes gradually became important goals of the textile industry. Of all natural textile fibres, hemp is considered {{to be one of the}} strongest and most durable. A wide range of natural extracts have been used for natural textile coloration and dyeing. Dyes deriving from natural sources have emerged as an important alternative to synthetic dyes. Ecofriendly, nontoxic, sustainable and renewable natural dyes and pigments have been used for colouring the food substrate, leather, wood, natural fibres and fabrics from the dawn of human history. The purpose of the research is to obtain ecologically coloured fabrics for textiles by using a method of dyeing that relies on natural ingredients extracted from red beet, onion leaves and black tea. The experiments are conducted on three different types of <b>hemp</b> <b>fabrics.</b> This paper presents the results of the studies regarding the dyeing process of <b>hemp</b> <b>fabrics</b> with natural extracts, the colours of the dyed samples inspected with reflectance spectra and the CIE L*a*b* colour space measurements...|$|R

The natural fibres as well as fabrics themselves are porous media. The porous media adsorbs water and content of moisture in fabrics have to be controlled. The metal-coated fabric characterization is an actual problem. Application of metal coatings for the functionalization of technical fibres and fabrics faced with influence of moisture on functional properties, e. g., the impedance of the metal coated K- glass and flax and <b>hemp</b> <b>fabrics</b> have strong dependence of content absorbed water or moisture. Presented studies are on the moisture content determination methodology based on thermogravimetric analyses and impedance spectroscopy. The leached K-glass fibres have three absorption sites with different kinetic and desorption heat. The flax has more complicated distribution of sorption/desorption sites. The water desorption heat 1, 3 kJ/g for both type of fabrics in temperature range 30 – 150 0 C {{is comparable to the}} water evaporation heat 2, 3 kJ/g at 100 0 C.

40|$|Until the 1900 s, hemp {{was one of}} four {{traditional}} {{textile fibers}} in Korea, the others being cotton, ramie, and silk. The production of hemp fabrics had traditionally been for family use, but since the 1950 s, that tradition has ceased to exist. The present status of hemp production is, therefore, extremely limited to the rural regions, and practiced by {{only a small number of}} the elderly (fig. 1). Of the approximately thirteen hemp cultivation regions (fig. 2), the city of Andong developed a different technique in hemp fiber-making from the rest of the regions and this paper will cover <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> production, concentrating on the traditional way of fiber making in Andong as well as how <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> was used in the past and being used presently in Korea.

40|$|Ramie and hemp fiber are {{two major}} fibers among the four {{traditional}} fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and ramie) of Korea. They have a very long history going back to {{as early as the}} first century AD Ramie fabric, as summer clothing, was enjoyed by upper class/royal families and scholars. On the other hand, <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> was worn by the lower class, such as people who worked in labor intensive fields. Hemp fabrics were also used for funerary costumes and shrouds; this tradition continues to the present time. After four years of on-site research, I presented two papers on two distinct types of Korean hemp fabrics (Andongpoh and Musam) at the TSA Biennial Symposia of 2006 and 2008. In the summer of 2009, I conducted another on-site research study on Korean ramie in Hansan County, which {{has a long history of}} ramie cultivation (dating to the 7 th century). For this research, I filmed and documented a ramie harvest and the complex steps of fabric production. As final products, there was little difference in quality between ramie and <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric.</b> However, different characteristics of these two fibers led to the development of different processing techniques in the two industries. The main focus of my presentation will be the morphological differences between ramie and hemp; the latter produced particularly in Andong County.

40|$|It is {{said that}} Korean hemp was already in use in BCE 2333 and that by the 7 th century it {{had become one of}} the primary fibers used. Today, Koreans {{manufacture}} hemp cloth for shrouds, funerary costumes, and everyday summer-wear. There are two types of Korean hemp cloth: Andongpoh (Seang-neang-ii), which is produced in Andong County and adjacent areas; and Musam (Ik-neang-ii), which is produced in eleven different regions throughout Korea. The majority of <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> production in Korea is Musam, and in Boseong County, in southern Korea, there is a particularly long history of Musam hemp cultivation. Twenty-five percent of all Korean hemp is cultivated in this region, and 50 % of market share in Korean <b>hemp</b> <b>fabric</b> is produced here. Adding further research that was conducted on Musam hemp production in Boseong County in 2007, to a presentation made in Toronto (in 2006) on this subject, this paper will focus on a step by step comparison of the two types of hemp production. The ultimate goal is to point out how the differences in production create the two different qualities of hemp cloth. In addition, the paper will address ways the market for the two types of hemp has changed in the present day. Both types of hemp are 35 cm (14 in) wide, but Andongpoh is much finer, as it is composed of 640 to 1200 warps. It is considered an exquisite fabric, and some historical references have been found in which it was presented as an inter-class gift by members of the lower/ middle class to members of the upper class. 2 Musam, on the other hand, which is coarse but very durable, was historically produced for clothing for the middle and lower classes and also for funerary garments.

40|$|In this paper, for {{the first}} time, {{inexpensive}} waterglass solutions are exploited as a new, simple and ecofriendly chemical approach for promoting {{the formation of a}} silica-based coating on <b>hemp</b> <b>fabrics,</b> able to act as a thermal shield and to protect the latter from heat sources. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis confirm the formation of -C-O-Si- covalent bonds between the coating and the cellulosic substrate. The proposed waterglass treatment, which is resistant to washing, seems to be very effective for improving the fire behavior of hemp fabric/epoxy composites, also in combination with ammonium polyphosphate. In particular, the exploitation of hemp surface treatment and Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) addition to epoxy favors a remarkable decrease of the Heat Release Rate (HRR), Total Heat Release (THR), Total Smoke Release (TSR) and Specific Extinction Area (SEA) (respectively by 83 %, 35 %, 45 % and 44 %) as compared to untreated hemp/epoxy composites, favoring the formation of a very stable char, as also assessed by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Because of the low interfacial adhesion between the fabrics and the epoxy matrix, the obtained composites show low strength and stiffness; however, the energy absorbed by the material is higher when using treated hemp. The presence of APP in the epoxy matrix does not affect the mechanical behavior of the composite...|$|R
