40|$|This {{thesis is}} solving issues {{concerning}} deburring of hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>blocks</b> with industrial robot. Thesis {{is focused on}} deburring of inside space of hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>blocks,</b> although deburring of outer edges is marginally mentioned due to determining of approximate deburring time of all edges on the <b>valve</b> <b>block.</b> Search of deburring methods and tools suitable for deburring of inside and outside edges is {{made on the basis}} of valve blocks´ analysis. Paths of tools chosen for deburring of <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> B 1 are programmed in CAM program. CAD program ProEngineer is used to create simplified model of robotic workplace and its layout. According to customer´s requirements, deburring method, which allows creating universal robotic workplace for deburring of hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>blocks,</b> was chosen. Approximate deburring time of all edges on B 1 block was set on the basis of tools´ paths and these were checked in the simplified model of robotic workplace in PowerMill Robot Interface. Deburring procedure, estimating of approximate deburring time of B 1 block and layout of robotic workplace are main results of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{sought to}} compare the {{long-term}} clinical outcomes of patients who underwent <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement with single-disc and bileaflet mechanical heart valves. MethodsFrom May 1975 through October 2001, 590 single-disc valves (7 models) were used for <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, and from November 1980 through July 2002, 1283 bileaflet valves (10 models) were used for <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. Detailed follow-up was performed {{to a maximum of}} 27. 4 and 21. 9 years with a total of 6872 and 5811 patient-years for single-disc valves and bileaflet valves, respectively. Survival and valve-related events were analyzed. ResultsSingle-disc valves were mainly implanted from 1975 through 1995, whereas bileaflet valves were mainly implanted from 1987 through 2002; thus the years of concurrent use were 1987 through 1995. The bileaflet valve had a significantly lower explantation rate, whereas the single-disc valve had a significantly lower thromboembolism rate. No significant differences were detected in early mortality, long-term survival, and other valve-related complications. When limiting the comparison to the concurrent period of 1987 through 1995, no significant difference was detected in survival or in any valve-related complication. ConclusionSingle-disc and bileaflet valves provide similar clinical performance. The predominant use of bileaflet valves is not based on clinical outcomes...|$|R
50|$|Tree {{complexity}} {{has increased}} {{over the last few}} decades. They are frequently manufactured from blocks of steel containing multiple valves rather than being assembled from individual flanged components.

50|$|The main <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> {{is usually}} a stack of off the shelf {{directional}} control valves chosen by flow capacity and performance.

50|$|Medical gas {{cylinders}} in the UK {{and some other}} countries have a fusible plug of Wood's metal in the <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> between the <b>valve</b> seat and the cylinder.

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain <b>valves,</b> <b>block</b> <b>valves,</b> pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} develop {{national}} benchmarks for valve replacement surgery by developing statistical risk models of operative mortality. BACKGROUNDNational risk models for {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG) have gained widespread acceptance, but there are no similar models for valve replacement surgery. METHODSThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database was used to identify risk factors associated with valve surgery from 1994 through 1997. The population was drawn from 49, 073 patients undergoing <b>isolated</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) and from 43, 463 patients undergoing CABG combined with AVR or MVR. Two multivariable risk models were developed: one for isolated AVR or MVR and one for CABG plus AVR or CABG plus MVR. RESULTSOperative mortality rates for AVR, MVR, combined CABG/AVR and combined CABG/MVR were 4. 00 %, 6. 04 %, 6. 80 % and 13. 29 %, respectively. The strongest independent risk factors were emergency/salvage procedures, recent infarction, reoperations and renal failure. The c-indexes were 0. 77 and 0. 74 for the <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement and combined CABG/valve replacement models, respectively. These models retained their predictive accuracy when applied to a prospective patient population undergoing operation from 1998 to 1999. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was 10. 6 (p = 0. 225) for the <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement model and 12. 2 (p = 0. 141) for the CABG/valve replacement model. CONCLUSIONSStatistical models have been developed to accurately predict operative mortality after valve replacement surgery. These models can be used to enhance quality by providing a national benchmark for valve replacement surgery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{examined}} {{the incidence of}} pulmonary embolism after cardiac surgery. Background. Because venous thromboembolism {{is considered to be}} an uncommon complication after cardiac surgery, its incidence was documented in a consecutive series of 1, 033 patients who underwent cardiac surgery over a 5 -year period. Methods. Parallel cohorts of patients in a tertiary referral center were evaluated and the incidence of pulmonary embolism was compared in subgroups of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, valve surgery and combined procedures. Results. Pulmonary embolism developed in 33 (3. 2 %) of the 1, 033 cardiac surgical patients, within 2 weeks of a coronary bypass operation in most; it did not develop in any patient who had <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement surgery (p < 0. 05). The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by pulmonary angiography in 24 patients, ventilation/perfusion lung scan in 3, postmortem examination in 5 and clinical examination in 1 patient. Important risk factors for pulmonary embolism included prolonged postoperative recovery, obesity and hyperlipidemia. The mortality rate was 18. 7 % in patients with in contrast to 3. 3 % in those without pulmonary embolism (p < 0. 01). Conclusions. Although pulmonary embolism is rare after <b>isolated</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, it is not an uncommon complication after coronary bypass surgery...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement hydraulic motors. This concept leads to com-plex <b>valve</b> <b>blocks,</b> attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed control, positioning and pressure maintaining functionality. The concept of secondary controlled hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, pressure maintaining function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power Control Units using secondary controlled hydraulic motors is presented. Theoretical, simulated and experimental results show typical operation sequences under load and a comparison of power requirement to conventional systems.
