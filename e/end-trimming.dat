30|$|After {{editing and}} <b>end-trimming</b> of the DNA traces, a portion (385  bp) of the {{mitochondrial}} COI gene {{was used for}} the genetic analyses. Each colony used for the morphological study was sequenced to measure levels of variation in COI. COI sequences of the other Caribbean species were added to the data set, for a total of 36 sequences (10 [*]M. complanata, 10 [*]M. alcicornis branched, 10 [*]M. alcicornis encrusted, 4 [*]M. striata, and 2 [*]M. squarrosa).|$|E
40|$|Virtually all {{large-scale}} sequencing projects use automatic sequence-assembly {{programs to}} aid in the determination of DNA sequences. The computer-generated assemblies require substantial hand-editing to transform them into submissions for GenBank. As the size of sequencing projects increases, it becomes essential {{to improve the quality of}} the automated assemblies so that this timeconsuming hand-editing may be reduced. Current ABI sequencing technology uses base calls made from fluorescently-labeled DNA fragments run on gels. We present a new representation for the fluorescent trace data associated with individual base calls. This representation can be used before, during, and after fragment assembly to improve the quality of assemblies. We demonstrate one such use – <b>end-trimming</b> of sub-optimal data – that results in a significant improvement in the quality of subsequent assemblies...|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} new, {{accurate}} and efficient tool for mapping short reads {{obtained from the}} Illumina Genome Analyzer following sodium bisulfite conversion. Our tool, BRAT, supports single and paired-end reads and handles input files containing reads and mates of different lengths. BRAT is faster, maps more unique paired-end reads and has higher accuracy than existing programs. The software package includes tools to <b>end-trim</b> low quality bases of the reads and to report nucleotide counts for mapped reads on the reference genome.

50|$|An I-joist has {{two main}} parts, {{the web and}} flange. The web is {{sandwiched}} between a top and bottom flange, creating the “I” shape. The flange {{can be made from}} laminated veneer lumber or solid wood finger-jointed together for ultimate strength. It is grooved on one side to receive the web. The web is typically made from plywood, laminated veneer lumber, or oriented strand board. After sizing the webs and flanges, they are assembled with water-resistant glue by pressing the web into the top and bottom flange. After assembly, the I-joist is <b>end-trimmed</b> and heat-cured or left at room temperature to reach approximately equilibrium moisture content. Sizes vary according to the I-joist's intended load and span. Depths can range from 9.25 to 24 in and reach up to 80 ft in length, although 40 to 42 ft is more common. The intended use for an I-joist is for floor and roof joists, wall studs and roof rafters in both residential and commercial construction.|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, PTA 1, that affects pre-tRNA processing. PTA 1 was initially {{defined by a}} UV-induced mutation, pta 1 - 1, that causes the accumulation of all 10 <b>end-trimmed,</b> intron-containing pre-tRNAs and temperature-sensitive but osmotic-remedial growth. pta 1 - 1 {{does not appear to}} be an allele of any other known gene affecting pre-tRNA processing. Extracts prepared from pta 1 - 1 strains had normal pre-tRNA splicing endonuclease activity. pta 1 - 1 was suppressed by the ochre suppressor tRNA gene SUP 11, indicating that the pta 1 - 1 mutation creates a termination codon within a protein reading frame. The PTA 1 gene was isolated from a genomic library by complementation of the pta 1 - 1 growth defect. Episome-borne PTA 1 directs recombination to the pta 1 - 1 locus. PTA 1 has been mapped to the left arm of chromosome I near CDC 24; the gene was sequenced and could encode a protein of 785 amino acids with a molecular weight of 88, 417. No other protein sequences similar to that of the predicted PTA 1 gene product have been identified within the EMBL or GenBank data base. Disruption of PTA 1 near the carboxy terminus of the putative open reading frame was lethal. Possible functions of the PTA 1 gene product are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} it is of the utmost importance to determine the value of a hydrocarbon accumulation. Key to this process is the prediction of reservoir flow and performance. Measurements on core are the main source of information that underpin this crucial prediction; however core is not always available and it is necessary to find another means to estimate the required flow properties.;Inspection of core data often reveals the presence of a simple relationship between the core porosity and the permeability to gas. Where this is the case, it is common practice to establish a relationship and then use estimates of porosity from wireline logs to predict permeability. However, for the reservoir examined in this thesis, like many others, this porosity-permeability relationship is neither linear, nor straight-forward.;A plug porosity-permeability relationship for this reservoir was derived from the analysis of 199 sandstone plugs. In addition 63 of these plugs have image analysis data; the <b>end-trims</b> of these plugs were impregnated, sectioned and polished. Back-scattered electron microscope images at both high (x 150) and low (x 30) magnifications were taken, captured as 256 grey scales and numerically analysed. This analysis enabled the pore geometry to be quantified.;The images data led to an improved understanding of the controls on permeability and porosity. This understanding was achieved by the demonstration that micro-porosity is an ineffective porosity in terms of fluid flow. Micro-porosity is identified as pores < 13 m 2 and mostly occurs within the clay (defined as the grey scale range 50 - 170 on the SEM images). Image porosity was calculated and observed to be less than plug porosity and has a stronger linear relationship with permeability; this is a result of micro-porosity being included in the measurement of plug porosity but not in the image porosity calculation. A non-linear relationship between gas permeability and mean pressure in the calculation of Klinkenberg permeability is present; a possible explanation for this observation is given...|$|R
