25|$|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5)– {{a crooked}} strip mall lawyer who {{represents}} Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I do Saul.|$|E
2500|$|A {{traditional}} {{art form}} of the Cahuilla people, basketry {{is not only a}} community, but a family tradition for Clarke. While his artworks do not utilize the same materials as seen in traditional basket making, he sees his creation process as similar to theirs: [...] "Cahuilla basket makers go out and gather materials, and they put them together to produce something that is both functional and aesthetic. I kind of do my work the same way. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I gather these things. I combine them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So?' thought Hilary. 'Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{warn the}} fellow to clear off, or shall I {{wait to see}} what happens when she goes away?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caught {{that boy}} and shook him until his {{freckles}} rattled.|$|R
5000|$|... “After breakfast <b>I</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{started to}} contact with my various {{financial}} holder women”.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{shut the}} door behind me, and stood and thanked God {{from the bottom of my}} heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "The swine {{think it}} is a great joke," [...] growled Obergatz, [...] "that the {{afternoon}} before I die <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hunt meat for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think there's {{nothing to}} be said--the thing must be faced somehow. I feel rather badly hit; you won't mind if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> walk about a little?" ...|$|E
60|$|FOOL. That {{they may}} catch {{the feet of}} the angels. But every morning, just before the dawn, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> cut the nets with my shears, and the angels fly away.|$|E
60|$|Jolnes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> up {{the street}} toward the corner, where we were to catch a surface car.|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes had}} lost their angry flash before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> {{something}} in his change of tone revealed the hard bargain-maker's inner self.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} myself," [...] explained Joey, the host, with a grim smile, [...] "it was about time that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> drowned myself. The canal is handy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It don't matter," [...] he said. [...] "Busted I {{came into}} the world, busted <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> I've been busted {{most of the time}} since I arrived. Come on; let's waltz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What queer boats!" [...] {{continued}} Rollo, {{looking out}} again upon the river. [...] "And {{there is a}} long bridge leading over to the other side. May <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> walk over on that bridge after breakfast?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{spread them}} out on the hills that they may catch the feet of the angels; but every morning just before the dawn, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> cut the nets with the shears and the angels fly away.|$|E
60|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the room felt close <b>and</b> heavy. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> walked to and fro--now in the shadow, and now in the moonlight--under the trees before the cottage door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Half a minute," [...] I said; [...] "I {{want to go}} and {{see what}} time it is." [...] <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> looked at the clock in the hall. I came back.|$|R
6000|$|... “I may as {{well tell}} you I’ve a letter from Lady Demesne,” his visitor went on. “It came to me just before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have it in my pocket.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I {{think they}} are right; that is, if they can afford time. I can't afford time. I'm here every day till five, Mr Gresham; then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> dine in Fleet Street, {{and then back to}} work till nine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll go {{anywhere}} {{so long as}} I {{can get out of}} this beastly country,' he answered wearily. 'I feel people are looking at me in the street when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> they're saying to one another: there's the son of that swindling rotter who was sentenced to seven years.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} madness. Look here;--lie down till Clara comes or till I return. Do not go beyond this room and your own. If she cannot come this evening I will return. Good-by now. I {{will see the}} {{servants}} as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> tell them {{what ought to be}} told." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{procured}} {{the easiest}} coach I could find, and {{inside of it}} we placed Mr. Stillwell, with the physician beside him, and Gus on the seat with the driver.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next evening}} Solly {{was to go}} to Coney Island with me at seven. At eight o'clock he hadn't showed up. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> found a cab. I felt sure there was {{something}} wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you knew}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> did you?" [...] asked the senator's son, {{in a voice}} that showed he was vexed. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> came back without your knowing it. I thought you were still in your berth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She said to me, 'I jump down, I jump {{down from}} my {{place on the}} snow,'" [...] cried Kotuko, with hollow eyes, leaning forward in the half-lighted hut. [...] "She said, 'I will be a guide.' She said, 'I will guide you to the good seal-holes.' To-morrow <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the tornaq will guide me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do we live here?' I said. 'Is it true we're {{going to}} the country? Wasn't that {{policeman}} a good sort? Don't you like policemen? I knew lots of policemen at the public-house. Are there any other dogs here? What is there for dinner? What's in that cupboard? When {{are you going to}} take me out for another run? May <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> see if I can find a cat?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I {{must leave}} you here while <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> get you lodgings for the present,' Ronald said, quietly; 'you won't object to my doing that, of course: {{you can easily}} pay me back from your salary {{as soon as we}} succeed in finding you some {{suitable}} occupation. Let me see, where can I put you for the next fortnight? Naturally you wouldn't like to live with religious people, would you?' ...|$|E
60|$|Wishing {{them every}} {{happiness}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> left them. <b>I</b> was occupied two hours over some badly needed repairs to the granary, {{and then for}} a long time I stood under the stars thinking of Grace.|$|R
2500|$|... "I also {{listened to}} Mahalia Jackson, {{all the great}} gospel singers. But the most {{important}} music to me was those hip-shakin’ boys: Wilson Pickett and Elvis Presley. I just loved Elvis Presley. Whatever he got, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> bought." ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{spoke to}} Mavovo, {{telling him to}} keep a good watch and {{to be sure that}} every man had his gun ready, as I thought that these people were slave-traders and might attack us in the night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so {{sensitive}} as a reformed floor-knocker. You {{will come up}} or let me come down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only {{thing for you to}} do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down and see if there's anything I can do to help.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is as pale as you are, monsieur, {{but not so}} thin. She {{does nothing}} but sit quiet all day with her eyes wide open--she who was always so bright and active and had a smile for every one. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> cry often after going into her room. She has just gone into the parlor. You will find her alone there," [...] she added, for Margot had always had her ideas as {{to the cause of}} Cuthbert's visits.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I find I can philosophize the {{situation}} {{about as well}} from the papers, and that's what I really want to do, I suppose. Besides, I'm solemnly pledged by Mrs. March not to go near any sort of crowd, under penalty of having her bring the children and go with me. Her theory is that we must all die together; the children haven't been at school since the strike began. There's no precaution that Mrs. March hasn't used. She watches me whenever <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> sees that I start straight for this office." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door. Monsieur Bartot turned towards me. I am {{convinced}} {{that he was about}} to offer me his hand and to call for that bottle of wine. I felt, however, that flight was safest. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> closed the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mum, I {{am sorry}} to say as it be. A chap came in early this morning and told me as summat had happened, so <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> {{half a mile from}} the town I finds it just as he says." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to reply when Dave, the ground-keeper, called me to the door, saying {{there was a man}} to see me. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> there stood Morrisey, manager of the Chicago American League team. We knew each other well and {{exchanged}} greetings.|$|R
