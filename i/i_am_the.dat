5|$|Commit This to Memory is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was {{released}} on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, formed in 1997, had first found success with their debut album, <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Movie (2002). The band toured in the interim years, creating positive word-of-mouth. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 {{on the road for}} a string of shows, which led to their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his first producing effort.|$|E
5|$|Music critics {{gave the}} record mixed reviews, praising the harmony of its {{material}} but also criticizing it for being repetitive. Commercially, <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Club Rocker experienced success in selected countries, peaking at number eight in Mexico {{and within the}} top 30 in Czech Republic, Belgium and France. It was certified Gold by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV) for selling 10,000 copies in Poland, and was also {{named one of the}} best albums of 2011 by Inna's label Roton, alongside Wounded Rhymes (2011) by Lykke Li and Christmas (2011) by Michael Bublé.|$|E

5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1997 by Cain and Pierre, and it took several years to form a stable lineup. The band signed to Epitaph in 2003, which {{released}} the band's debut album, <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Movie. Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth album, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group {{and was replaced by}} Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band.|$|E

Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2000s, the band {{continued}} to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members—bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton—to join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together $6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with the Get Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album in ten days, which was stressful, and Rose would frustrate the band with insults in order to record better. Initial copies of the band's debut, <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Movie, were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold {{out of the back of}} their tour van for a year.|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E
