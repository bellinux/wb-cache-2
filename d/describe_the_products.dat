50|$|At first, {{it seemed}} as though the new {{radiation}} was similar to the then recently discovered X-rays. Further research by Becquerel, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Villard, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and others showed that this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Rutherford was the first to realize that all such elements decay in accordance with the same mathematical exponential formula. Rutherford and his student Frederick Soddy were the first to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one element to another. Subsequently, the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was formulated to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of alpha and beta decay.|$|E

Using a DEX description and the raw image file, evidence can be reproduced by other tools with the same functionality. Additionally, DEX descriptions can identify differences between two separate investigations of the same raw evidence. Fi-nally, as a standard product of tools, DEX can allow quick fabrication of tool chains either as best of breed amalgams or for tool testing.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} current state of AI {{middleware}} for games. The main focus is on pathfinding in three dimensional worlds, and the prestudy contains a description of two common approaches to this task. Other topics, including decision-making, are also mentioned. The core of the thesis concerns the evaluation of five middleware products. The evaluation is intended to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> ’ features, and to rank them according to specified evaluation criteria. A prototype implementation is developed using the most highly ranked product. This is intended to further evaluate the selected product, and also to show how to integrate the middleware in a complete application. Results from prototype development shows that many common AI tasks can be solved successfully using middleware products. The evaluated products differ vastly in scope and focus, and it is recognised that the choice of middleware product is highly dependent on the exact requirements for a given project. 2 Prefac...|$|E
40|$|We <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of the {{reaction}} of the hydroperoxy radical (HO_ 2) with the alkylperoxy radical formed following addition of the nitrate radical (NO_ 3) and O_ 2 to isoprene. NO_ 3 adds preferentially to the C_ 1 position of isoprene (> 6 times more favorably than addition to C_ 4), followed by the addition of O_ 2 to produce a suite of nitrooxy alkylperoxy radicals (RO_ 2). At an RO_ 2 lifetime of ∼ 30 s, δ-nitrooxy and β-nitrooxy alkylperoxy radicals are present in similar amounts. Gas-phase product yields from the RO_ 2 + HO_ 2 pathway are identified as 0. 75 – 0. 78 isoprene nitrooxy hydroperoxide (INP), 0. 22 methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) + formaldehyde (CH_ 2 O) + hydroxyl radical (OH) + nitrogen dioxide (NO_ 2), and 0 – 0. 03 methacrolein (MACR) + CH_ 2 O + OH + NO_ 2. We further examined the photochemistry of INP and identified propanone nitrate (PROPNN) and isoprene nitrooxy hydroxyepoxide (INHE) as the main products. INHE undergoes similar heterogeneous chemistry as isoprene dihydroxy epoxide (IEPOX), likely contributing to atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation...|$|E

40|$|A {{business}} subject {{who wishes}} to enter an established technological market is required to accurately analyse {{the features of the}} products of the different competitors. Such features are normally accessible through natural language (NL) brochures, or NL Web pages, which <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> to potential customers. Building a feature model that hierarchically summarises the different features available in competing products can bring relevant benefits in market analysis. A company can easily visualise existing features, and reason about aspects that are not covered by the available solutions. However, designing a feature model starting from publicly available documents of existing products is a time consuming and error-prone task. In this paper, we present two tools, namely Commonality Mining Tool (CMT) and Feature Diagram Editor (FDE), which can jointly support the feature model definition process. CMT allows mining common and variant features from NL descriptions of existing products, by leveraging a natural language processing (NLP) approach based on contrastive analysis, which allows identifying domain-relevant terms from NL documents. FDE takes the commonalities and variabilities extracted by CMT, and renders them in a visual form. Moreover, FDE allows the graphical design and refinement of the final feature model, by means of an intuitive GU...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of pyrimidines of DNA to {{ionizing}} radiation under aerobic conditions or oxidizing agents results in {{attack on the}} 5, 6 double bond of the pyrimidine ring or on the exocyclic 5 -methyl group. The primary product of oxidation of the 5, 6 double bond of thymine is thymine glycol, while oxidation of the 5 -methyl group yields 5 -hydroxymethyluracil. Oxidation of the 5, 6 double bond of cytosine yields cytosine glycol, which decomposes to 5 -hydroxycytosine, 5 -hydroxyuracil and uracil glycol, {{all of which are}} repaired in DNA by Escherichia coli endonuclease III. We now <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of oxidation of 5 -methylcytosine in DNA. Poly(dG-[3 H]dmC) was gamma-irradiated or oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Fe 3 + and ascorbic acid. The oxidized co-polymer was incubated with endonuclease III or 5 -hydroxymethyluracil-DNA glycosylase, to determine whether repairable products were formed, or digested to 2 '-deoxyribonucleosides, to determine the total complement of oxidative products. Oxidative attack on 5 -methylcytosine resulted primarily in formation of thymine glycol. The radiogenic yield of thymine glycol in poly(dG-dmC) was the same as that in poly(dA-dT), demonstrating that 5 -methylcytosine residues in DNA were equally susceptible to radiation-induced oxidation as were thymine residues...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{investigation}} and {{a discussion of}} hybridity and related terms as used in linguistic studies of genre. The theoretical points that are made are illustrated with data from empirical research done by others and with the authors’ own data. The focus is on written texts but hybridity in spoken interaction is also discussed. The article defines the notion of genre and discusses (proto) typicality in relation to genre and hybridity. Recontextualization is also discussed. This {{is followed by a}} discussion of terms that have been used to talk about the processes of hybridity, firstly, as used in research that has mainly been done on spoken interaction. The focus then turns to terms that have mainly been used in research on written texts: sequential intertextuality, genre embedding, genre appropriation, genre blending, as well as terms referring to pervasive trends such as commodification. Terms that take a product-like perspective on hybridity are then discussed. First there is a discussion of terms, such as “macrogenre,” which are used to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of hybridization. This is followed by a discussion of genre chains and superordinate categories, such as “genre colonies,” grouped together because of the hybridizing forces that permeate them...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the texture of a set of processed cheeses by consumers taking diversity in perception, handling the product and vocabulary into account. Hence, a free-text comment methodology using a personal approach was investigated to answer the following questions: Which are the terms frequently generated by consumers? Which are the main characteristics of products based on consumer descriptions? Are we able to identify the texture specificities of a product or a group of products? A set of 20 products representing the texture diversity in the processed cheese market were studied. The term frequencies were studied for the entire product set. In total, 550 different terms were generated, among which, 9 terms Sticky, Shiny, Yellow, Smooth, Compact, Hard, Spreadable, Creamy and Easy to spread were the most frequently elicited by the consumers. In addition, the product profiles were obtained on the basis of the products' main characteristics. Specific terms and differences in frequencies were then studied for each product. This approach made it possible to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> by means of the terms given by consumers.
