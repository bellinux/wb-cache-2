Peach flavor {{is a very}} sweet and delightful fruity flavor {{which can be used}} in many products. Therefore, developing a peach flavor is of significant interests. This article deals with developing a <b>fresh</b> <b>peach</b> flavor. According to the odor peach fruit, the notes of peach were identified. Proper chemical ingredients were selected to imitate the odor of peach and to create a peach flavor. A <b>fresh</b> <b>peach</b> flavor formula was obtained. The functions and the odors of raw materials in the peach flavor were discussed. The peach flavor obtained is of fresh harmonious peach odor and is very similar to the odor of natural peach fruit...|$|E

Furthermore, kaolin {{has been found}} to positively affect fruit external and internal quality with various fruit species. We investigated the effect of kaolin particle film application on fresh and canned clingstone peach fruit quality and inorganic element composition. Kaolin was applied periodically from early July to early August 2010 on 'Andross' peach trees. <b>Fresh</b> <b>peach</b> fruit treated with kaolin and harvested at commercial maturity (middle of August) had increased flesh firmness (FF), soluble solids content (SSC) and acidity and lower water content (WC) compared to control fruit. Kaolin presence on <b>fresh</b> <b>peach</b> fruit skin did not affect L∗, but decreased a∗ compared to control fruit even after kaolin removal with water. In addition, kaolintreated <b>fresh</b> <b>peach</b> fruit had similar P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, Cd, and Ni and slightly lower Pb contents compared to control peach fruit, while Co and Cr were not detected. Canned peach fruit had modified quality compared to fresh fruit, but most of the differences in quality attributes between kaolin-treated and control fruit remained after canning. Peach fruit color was similar in the two treatments after peeling and canning. Finally, the processed peach fruit treated with kaolin had decreased P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni and similar Ca, Na, Cd, Pb contents compared to processed control fruit, while Co and Cr were not detected. It seemed that certain nutrients leaked from the kaolin-treated processed peach fruit to the syrup resulting in decreased SSC and inorganic element content in the processed peach halves compared to the fresh kaolintreated fruit. © 2015 ISHS...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} agricultural commodity markets {{is the extent}} to which those markets respond to price changes in related markets. Given a competitive market structure, the Law of One Price (LOP) postulates that spatial price relationships are determined by transfer cost 1 among regions and that spatial arbitrage restores market equilibrium (Tomek and Robinson, 2003). Spatial price relationships are of particular relevance to farmers in designing market strategies. Measurements of spatial price relationships provide insights about the dynamics of price movements, thus increasing understanding of likely behavior of supply or demand areas in the market (Jordan and Van Sickle, 1998). For example, knowledge of which regions lead prices, the degree to which market shocks are transmitted via prices among regions, and the regional market reaction time can all be useful in designing market strategy. This study analyzes spatial wholesale price relationships for fresh U. S. peaches using vector autoregressive analysis (VAR) on weekly prices from the primary wholesale markets of four U. S. regions. Primary objectives of the study are: (1) to determine the degree of market segmentation as well as the direction and magnitude of market integration among regions, and (2) to evaluate the sensitivity of U.

Twenty castrated, crossbred Santa Ines lambs, with average age of 150 days and body weight of 22. 4 ± 3. 4 kg, were distributed in a completely randomized design with four experimental diets composed of the following: fresh by-product of peach palm enriched with urea + ammonia sulfate (FU); <b>fresh</b> <b>peach</b> palm by-product + concentrate (FP); silage of peach palm by-product + concentrate (SP); and silage of peach palm by-product enriched with 15 % of cornmeal + concentrate (SPC). Intake was recorded daily, and the digestibility coefficients were estimated with the internal marker indigestible acid detergent fiber (iADF). Diet FU resulted in the lowest intake and digestibility of the nutrients evaluated. Animals receiving diet FP showed higher intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total digestible nutrients (TDN), and digestible energy (DE) in relation to animals fed diets SP and SPC.

A sensory trained panel using the sensory texture descriptors 'hardness, 'crispness, 'crunchiness, 'melting, and 'juiciness' determined the sensory profile of each variety. Penetration tests, texture profile analysis (TPA), and mechanical acoustic analysis profile tests were performed using a TA-XT Plus texture meter. Principal component analysis defined the most influential rheological variables of each test. We also performed regression analysis by partial least squares (RPLS); as regressor variables we used the set of the rheological variables and the sensory attributes as dependent variables. The RPLS model explained 62 % of the relationship between rheological and sensory variables. The strongest relationships were between 'hardness' and the TPA variables, and 'melting' and quantity of juice and the TPA variables.
