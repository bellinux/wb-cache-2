40|$|We {{argue that}} a primary focus on energy {{efficiency}} may {{not be sufficient to}} slow (and ultimately reverse) the growth in total energy consumption and carbon emissions. Instead, policy makers need to return to an earlier emphasis on "conservation," with energy efficiency seen as a means rather than an end in itself. We briefly review the concept of "intensive" versus "extensive" variables (i. e., energy efficiency versus energy consumption), and why attention to both consumption and efficiency is essential for effective policy in a carbon- and oil-constrained world with increasingly brittle energy markets. To start, energy indicators and policy evaluation metrics need to reflect energy consumption as well as efficiency. We introduce the concept of "progressive efficiency," with the expected or required level of efficiency varying as a function of house size, appliance capacity, or more generally, the scale of energy services. We propose introducing progressive efficiency criteria first in consumer information programs (including appliance labeling categories) and then in voluntary rating and recognition programs such as ENERGY STAR. As acceptance grows, the concept could be extended to utility rebates, tax incentives, and ultimately to mandatory codes and standards. For these and other programs, incorporating criteria for consumption as well as efficiency offers a path for energy experts, policy-makers, and the public to begin building consensus on energy policies that recognize the limits of resources and global carrying-capacity. Ultimately, it is both necessary and, we believe, possible to manage energy consumption, not just efficiency in order to achieve a sustainable energy balance. Along the way, we may find it possible to shift <b>expectations</b> <b>away</b> from perpetual growth and toward satisfaction with sufficiency...|$|E
40|$|According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it {{is clear}} that the {{buildings}} sector presents the biggest potential for deep and fast [CO. sup. 2] emission reductions on a cost-effective basis. Interestingly, this assessment was premised exclusively on technical (engineering) measures, but ignored completely the behavioural and lifestyle dimensions of energy consumption in the buildings sector. Behavioural change in buildings, however, can deliver even faster and zero-cost improvements in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission reductions. With this in mind, designers are beginning to shift their attention to how they can widen the range of opportunities available in a building to provide comfort for the occupants, both in new-build and retrofit contexts. This in turn has re-awakened an interest in the role of natural ventilation in the provision of comfort. This discussion about adaptive comfort raises several questions, including the following: How can we shift occupants' comfort <b>expectations</b> <b>away</b> from the static indoor climates of the past towards the more variable thermal regimes found in naturally ventilated buildings? Are building occupants 'addicted' to static environments, i. e. air-conditioning (AC) ? If so, how tolerant or compliant will they be when the thermally constant conditions provided by AC are replaced by the thermally variable conditions that characterize naturally ventilated spaces? Does the frequency of prior exposure to AC bias building occupants' thermal expectations and, if so, what are the implications of this bias for their acceptance of naturally ventilated indoor climates? Does prior exposure to AC lead building occupants to actually prefer AC over natural ventilation? This article addresses these questions in the context of a large field study of building occupants in a hot and humid climate zone in Brazil (Maceio). The temperature preferences registered on 975 questionnaires in naturally ventilated buildings are statistically analysed in relation to occupants' prior exposure to AC in their workplaces. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Rational {{expectations}} models fail {{to explain}} the disconnect between the exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals. In line with survey evidence on the behaviour of foreign exchange traders, we introduce model misspecification and learning into a standard monetary model. Agents use simple forecasting rules based on a restricted information set. They learn about the parameters and performance of different models and can switch between forecasting rules. We compute the implied post-Bretton Woods US dollar-pound sterling exchange rate and show that the excess volatility of the exchange rate return can be reproduced with low values of the learning gain. Both assumptions, misspecification and learning, are necessary to generate this result. However, the implied correlations with the fundamentals are {{higher than in the}} data.

To address these problems, a new approach that combines ray tracing and programming has been used in a junior level elective course Intro. to Computing with Geometry with great success. With ray tracing, we are able to cover the camera metaphor, basic shapes, geometric modeling, coefficients of an illumination model, light sources, textures, surface tessellation, smooth and non-smooth triangles, and algebraic surfaces.

40|$|We study {{very light}} dilaton, arising from a scale-invariant {{ultraviolet}} {{theory of the}} Higgs sector in the standard model of particle physics. Imposing the scale symmetry below the ultraviolet scale of the Higgs sector, we alleviate the fine-tuning problem associated with the Higgs mass. When the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken radiatively à la Coleman-Weinberg, the dilaton develops a vacuum <b>expectation</b> value <b>away</b> from the origin to give an extra contribution to the Higgs potential so that the Higgs mass becomes naturally around the electroweak scale. The ultraviolet scale of the Higgs sector can be therefore {{much higher than the}} electroweak scale, as the dilaton drives the Higgs mass to the electroweak scale. We also show that the light dilaton in this scenario is a good candidate for dark matter of mass m_D∼ 1 eV- 10 keV, if the ultraviolet scale is about 10 - 100 TeV. Finally we propose a dilaton-assisted composite Higgs model to realize our scenario. In addition to the light dilaton the model predicts a heavy U(1) axial vector boson and two massive, oppositely charged, pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which might be accessible at LHC.

40|$|Quantum Chromo - Dynamics (QCD) is {{the part}} of the Standard Model which {{describes}} the interaction of the strong nuclear force with matter. QCD is asymptotically free, so at high energies perturbation expansions in the coupling can be used to calculate <b>expectation</b> values. <b>Away</b> from this limit, however, perturbation expansions in the coupling do not converge. Lattice QCD (LQCD) is a non - perturbative approach to calculations in QCD. LQCD first performs a Wick rotation t → - it [subscript E], and then discretises spacetime into a regular lattice with some lattice spacing a. QCD is then expressed in terms of parallel transport operators of the gauge field between grid points, and fermion fields which are defined at the grid points. Operators are evaluated in terms of these quantities, and the lattice spacing is then taken to zero to recover continuum values. We perform computer simulations of Lattice QCD in order to extract a variety of meson observables. In particular, we perform a comprehensive survey of the light and strange meson octets, obtain for the first time exotic meson results consistent with experiment, calculate the charge form - factor of the light and strange pseudoscalar mesons, and determine (for the first time in Lattice QCD) all three form - factors of the vector meson.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of Birkeland currents derived from Iridium magnetometer data acquired in the Northern Hemisphere to determine the dependence of large-scale currents on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction. Because the Iridium data span nearly seven years, we can restrict analysis to only those intervals with stable currents. We used image comparison to quantify the consistency between successive one-hour current distributions and selected 1550 two-hour intervals, 5 % of the data, for analysis. Results include: no statistically significant average currents are present poleward of 80 &deg; during southward IMF; Region- 2 currents are weak and confined to latitudes &gt; 65 &deg; during northward IMF; there is marked contrast between currents for northward and southward IMF but {{the evolution of the}} patterns is continuous with IMF rotation. The directions of flows inferred from the most poleward currents are more consistent with theoretical <b>expectations</b> of transport <b>away</b> from magnetopause reconnection than previous results. We attribute the differences to the restriction in this analysis to intervals having relatively stable distributions of current so that the data set corresponds more nearly to pure states of the system...|$|R
40|$|Despite many {{efforts at}} the national, state, {{and local levels}} to promote the use of {{computers}} in K- 12 classrooms, over the past 20 years, the impact of the computer on teaching and learning has been minimal. In this article, we examine how one school district has advanced {{the use of computers}} in the classroom by focusing first on curriculum rather than on technology. While national and state technology standards for teachers, as well as educational technology textbooks, tend to start with computer hardware and how to troubleshoot it, teachers in the district described here spend very little time on hardware or troubleshooting. Instead, as a result of district choices with regard to technology, support, and training, teachers are able to bypass the hardware and troubleshooting and move quickly to more productive and inventive uses of technology in the classroom. Our research offers a paradox for furthering the use of computers in classrooms-if we take <b>away</b> <b>expectations</b> for technical skills and allow teachers to focus on developing curriculum, evaluating learning materials, and thinking about how to provide better learning opportunities for their students, teachers are likely to use technology more effectively and creatively in their teaching...|$|R

These games provide a valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that can be compared {{from one place to}} the next, yet challenges remain in how to interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs) with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship between contributions and <b>expectations,</b> shifting strategies <b>away</b> from unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating the relationship between contributions and expectations...|$|R

Respondents were asked to (dis) agree with a number of statements about the police, personal experience of the police. Respondents were asked to name deterrents and worries which would stop them breaking the law, knowledge/experience of court procedures, whether respondent had seen any television plays about juvenile court or magistrates court. Penalties respondent would dislike most, opinion on various motives for theft, whether small fine and court appearance preferable to large fine and no court appearance. Respondents were asked to suggest a fair penalty for taking a car joy-riding, knowledge of penalties for a variety of offences. Details of respondent's own offences: number of times offence committed, age at first offence, whether taken to court (age at first/last appearance), penalty received for first/last offence, whether penalty considered fair.

40|$|For over a decade, {{contracts}} {{literature has}} focused on standardization. Scholars asked how terms become standard, and why they change so rarely. This line of inquiry painted a world where a standard term persists until it is dislodged by another standard term, perhaps after a brief window of ferment before the second term takes hold. It also overshadowed the early insights of boilerplate theories, which described contracts as a mix of standard and customized terms, and asked why the mix might be suboptimal. This article brings the focus back to the mix. It examines the development of selected provisions in sovereign bond contracts after a widely publicized boilerplate shift in 2003. The adoption of collective action clauses in sovereign bonds five years ago moved the documentation standard in New York closer to the prevailing practice in London. However, contrary to <b>expectations,</b> the shift <b>away</b> from old boilerplate {{did not lead to}} convergence around new boilerplate. Issuers in London and, to a lesser extent, in New York, have been experimenting with diverse formulations and institutional arrangements, including trustees and creditor committees. The contracts we study, as well as our interviews with practitioners and officials, suggest that standardization may be a matter of degree, that the degree of standardization may vary across different markets, and that a shock of the sort that led the 2003 shift may dislodge a previously standard term without replacing it with a new standard - erstwhile boilerplate becomes a platform for customization...|$|R

Standard rational <b>expectations</b> models assume <b>away</b> direct communication among speculative traders and resort to psychological traits such as traders' overconfidence in information processing ability {{to explain the}} observed enormous trading activity in financial markets. Yet, a growing literature documents that social communication affects individual trading behavior and market trading patterns, and over- and underconfident traders may coexist. The dissertation thus has two general objectives: (1) to analyze the impact of social communication on asset pricing, agents' trading behavior and welfare, and (2) to examine how traders' changing confidences resulted from communication affect asset pricing and trading behavior. Chapter 2 develops an asset pricing model in which agents communicate information in social networks prior to trading. An agent who is more confident in her private information puts greater weight on her private signal than on signal received through communication when aggregating her information. The results are as follows: Proximity between agents in networks affects correlation of agent demands; Individual agent exploits information and influences price distinctly in different networks; Under certain circumstances social communication is welfare improving for all agents; Irrespective of different network structures, market trading patterns such as market liquidity, trading volume, price volatility and informational efficiency of prices are all higher in communication economy relative to those in economy where agents exploit private signals exclusively; Market trading patterns are strictly decreasing in agents' confidence in private signals. Interestingly, social communication can alternatively explain some intriguing empirical facts such as "gender trading differences" which were attributed to overconfidence. Chapter 3 develops a multi-period market model to examine the evolution of risk averse agents' confidence degrees in learning their abilities to obtain precise information and the properties of resulting price volatility, trading volume, and expected profits. Agents initially do not know their abilities which {{are related to the}} qualities of private signals. They assess abilities from communicating and comparing quality of their own signals with that of others. Agents are assumed to credit (blame) themselves strongly for favorable (unfavorable) outcomes.
