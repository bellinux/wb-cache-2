25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. I {{consider}} the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
500|$|Corgan {{has said}} that [...] "For the solo in 'Fuck You (An Ode to No One),' I played until my fingers saw blood, You can't play a weak guitar solo in such a propulsive song. It's got to be attack-style." [...] He {{explains}} this method by saying [...] "... I put on the headphones and stand one foot away from the amp. I turn the amp up so loud that I literally have to play harder than the feedback, because if <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes." ...|$|E

500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift as soon as <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> fixating on it—I remember thinking my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have been scared without Rex [...] I got through it. You can't chase the muse, or you'll scare it away.|$|E
500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>stop,</b> keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was right up there with the best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her time}} on the show, the Downton Abbey cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012 (for series 2), and were {{nominated}} also in 2013 (for series 3). Finneran announced her departure in March 2013, ahead of the fourth series, explaining {{that she had been}} signed for only three series and did not wish to extend her contract, adding: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> loving something, <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> doing it." [...] Later that year, when asked by the Radio Times how her character's abrupt exit would be handled, Finneran retorted: [...] "I’m hoping she’s flung off the roof of the Abbey".|$|E

A rather embarrassing incident for Coleman occurred {{when he was}} interviewing Cookie Lavagetto when the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] started. Coleman later said, [...] "Believe me, when the Anthem starts, <b>I</b> <b>stop,</b> whether I'm taping, talking, or eating a banana." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kasparov {{has written}} {{in support of}} New Chronology (Fomenko), {{although}} with some reservations. In 2001, Kasparov {{expressed a desire to}} devote his time to this research after his chess career. [...] "New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect... My analytical abilities are well placed {{to figure out what was}} right and what was wrong." [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> playing chess, it may well be that I concentrate on promoting these ideas... I believe they can improve our lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some critics {{stated that}} the game's weak points {{included}} its complexity; some reviewers disliked how much micromanagement was required to effectively field one race against another, saying that this complexity was detrimental to the game. As one reviewer mentioned, [...] "...when <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> having fun, <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> playing." [...] The learning curve was also stated as being very steep for an RTS, due to each race being different. Another thing critics disliked was the player's inability to 'zoom out' with the in-game camera; this sometimes {{got in the way}} of large battles, and was especially noticeable when playing as or against the Tau, as their long-range weapons often resulted in them engaging their targets off-screen. While general consensus on the revamped single-player campaign was positive, some critics felt that it was not particularly challenging; they found that the AI was strategically weak, and there were no random elements in most skirmish missions that would enhance replayability. The usage of a random auto-resolve feature to determine which races won which territories was seen as a downside; also, one critic found that the AI attacked his homebase very rarely, and that they would attack insignificant zones regardless of the opportunity to capture more significant ones.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2003, Rouvas {{appeared}} with Antonis Remos and Nana Mouskouri at the Arion Awards. He released his ninth album, To Hrono Stamatao (<b>I</b> <b>Stop</b> Time), in December; it was certified gold after its release. Songs from the album received radio airplay, and that month Rouvas began appearing at Fever with Giorgos Tsalikis and ONE {{for the winter}} season. A Greek version of [...] "Feelings" [...] from the album, [...] "Pes Tis" [...] ("Tell Her"), [...] was released as a single with the same video as its French- and English-language counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{spoke about}} {{his desire to}} {{continue}} his boxing career further, “Anything is possible, I’m {{not going to make}} an immediate decision. Why would <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> when I looked that good though?... I want a shot at a cruiserweight title ... I do intend on fighting and we’ll see what happens in the future. I looked good." [...] Jones later told On The Ropes Boxing Radio, [...] "Yeah I think it’s my last year in boxing, and I tell people all the time." [...] Hinting he may retire at the end of 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Good Humor became {{unprofitable}} {{beginning in}} 1968. An increase in gasoline prices {{during the early}} 1970s made the situation worse. After absorbing losses for ten years, in 1978 Good Humor decided to sell the fleet and become a distributor itself. The trucks were sold for $1,000 to $3,000 per vehicle, {{and many of the}} former Good Humor vendors became independent business owners. As one reported, [...] "I make sure I shut off the engine when <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> now that I'm paying for the gas." [...] Ironically, many former competitors also became distributors of Good Humor products.|$|E
2500|$|During a Playboy {{interview}} in 1992, Williams {{was asked whether}} he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, [...] "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> trying, I get afraid." [...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the rest}} of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Pride {{continued}} to rack up country music hits. Other Pride standards then include [...] "Mississippi Cotton Picking Delta Town", [...] "Someone Loves You, Honey", [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Stop</b> Leavin' (I'll Be Gone)", [...] "Burgers and Fries", [...] "I Don't Think She's in Love Anymore", [...] "Roll on Mississippi", [...] "Never Been So Loved (In All My Life)", and [...] "You're So Good When You're Bad". Like many other country performers, he has paid tribute to Hank Williams, with an album of songs that were all written by Hank entitled There's a Little Bit of Hank in Me, which included top-sellers of Williams' classics [...] "Kaw-Liga", [...] "Honky Tonk Blues", and [...] "You Win Again". Pride has sold over 70 million records (singles, albums, and compilation included).|$|E

2500|$|At 5 feet, 11inches, and 185 pounds, Doll {{was small}} for a {{professional}} football player. [...] In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, [...] "Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than your cousin Joe." [...] Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: [...] "I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. [...] If they are over two tons I aim for their shoelaces. [...] If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I hit for the thighs. [...] I'll admit I do not drive 'em back but <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> 'em where they are. ... My size is no detriment in football. [...] I rate as the No. 1 asset the 'desire' to tackle. [...] And I've plenty of that desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frank Williams gave Regazzoni {{his final}} drive in a {{competitive}} car alongside Alan Jones. The Williams FW07 proved to be very competitive, especially in the final part of the season, with FW07s winning {{all but two of}} the final six races of the 1979 calendar. The first win was for Regazzoni, at Silverstone, the first of over 100 victories for the Williams Grand Prix team. In deference to the team's Saudi sponsors, he celebrated on the podium with Lilt. However, despite his achievement, once again he was replaced by Carlos Reutemann {{at the end of the}} season. At the Italian Grand Prix, motor sport journalist Nigel Roebuck asked Regazzoni why he continued to drive at the age of 40, with no prospect of a competitive seat. Regazzoni replied, [...] "I love , and most of all I love to drive racing cars. So why should <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> when I feel this way?". At the end of the year he was invited to compete in the 1980 International Race of Champions, the last active Formula One driver, alongside Mario Andretti, to do so.|$|E
2500|$|... "How Far I'll Go" [...] was {{composed}} as Moana's [...] "I Want" [...] song, {{following in the}} long tradition of [...] "I Want" [...] songs in 1990s Disney animated musicals. It replaced an earlier attempt called [...] "More", for which the demo version recorded by Marcy Harriell was released as an outtake on the deluxe version of the soundtrack album. [...] Although Miranda has stressed that he is still [...] "very proud of" [...] the song as a first draft, [...] "More" [...] was not good enough in retrospect because it merely expressed Moana's vague desire to see more since she had already figured out everything about the island. In contrast, [...] "How Far I'll Go" [...] expresses a deeper, richer message: Moana's struggle with the irresistible impulse to explore beyond the reef notwithstanding her genuine love for her island, her family, and her people. [...] As Miranda explained to People: [...] "To me that's much more complicated than, 'I hate it here and I want to get out,' ... To say, ‘I love it here, I love my parents, but why can't <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> walking to the ocean and fantasizing about getting out of here?' And questioning that instinct? It's even more confusing. And that's a valid story too." ...|$|E
