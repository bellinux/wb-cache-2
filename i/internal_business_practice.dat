40|$|In {{view of the}} ‘divergence dilemma’ {{between the}} {{aspirations}} of Islamic economics and the commercially oriented nature of Islamic finance, this research explores the prospect of incorporating social responsibility dimension {{in the practice of}} Islamic investment, in line with the normative goals of Islamic economics. The significance of the study is further emphasised {{in the face of the}} rapidly growing Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) movement, which uses various social, ethical, and environmental issues in investment to promote socially responsible behaviours among corporations. The conceptual discussion and empirical analysis of the study aims to explore and examine four important areas relevant to the research: the Islamic perspective of social responsibility and its normative foundations; the investment strategies that can be used to address social responsibility dimension; the investors’ perspective on the importance of social responsibility dimension and its various issues; and the investors’ level of commitment to incorporate these criteria into actual investment. In the light of the SRI experience, the conceptual discussion focuses on delineating the Islamic perspective of social responsibility, resulting in a unified behavioural framework of social responsibility issues and commitment. The theoretical model is based on the ethical values embedded in the Shari’ah and its underlying objectives (Maqasid al-Shari’ah), the precepts of justice (‘adl) and beneficence (ihsan), and the notion of ultimate happiness (falah). The discussion further evaluates the present practices of Islamic investment in relation to social responsibility dimension and explores the potential of applying various SRI strategies in the Islamic investment sector. The empirical component of the study aims to explore and examine the perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of the investors of Islamic funds in Malaysia in relation to the prospect of incorporating social responsibility dimension and its various issues in investment. Overall, social responsibility dimension is recognised by the respondents as part of an essential component in Shari’ah based investments. Nevertheless, there seemed to be a hierarchy in the component they perceived as important, with social responsibility dimension came third in the list after the fiqh injunction and economic dimensions. Additionally, the examination on the perceived importance of various social responsibility issues revealed that the underlying factor that influenced this perception is shaped by the nature of the criteria, particularly the distinction between harm prevention and the promotion of good, and the differentiation between <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice</b> and external stakeholders. The study also found encouraging results on the willingness of the respondents to incorporate social responsibility criteria in their actual investment. The findings suggest that important factors influencing investors’ perceptions and commitment to incorporate social responsibility dimension in Islamic investment include participation in individually oriented behaviour, socio-demographic variables such as ethnicity, religion, age, income, education, types of occupation and organisation, as well as the level of SRI awareness. Additionally, while individual’s investment decision is shown to be highly influenced by normative consideration, favourable financial expectation remains a strong driving factor in all of the behaviours examined; obedient, altruistic and sacrificial behaviours. In view of the prominent influence of financial motive in the decisions of individuals, the interpretive discussion explores the potential of a strategic framework of social responsibility as a complement to the normative foundations in creating additional incentive and enabling environment towards goal realisation in an Islamic economy. ...|$|E

They are not only used in warehouses or distribution centers, but also in all those activities that require an efficient and effective method of transportation. To better understand <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> and external factors that impacts supply chain management (SCM), a survey of 1, 500 U. S. wood pallet manufacturers was conducted.

According to more than 150 state and local stakeholders surveyed in April 2009 and again in April 2010, this amount of coordination requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve its capacity to fully support state, local, and tribal stakeholders; to improve its <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> to better implement federal policies and guidance; and {{to find a way}} to use thematic goals and transition forums to create a better understanding of prevention, protection, and coordination in every region, taking differences between states and major metropolitan areas into account...|$|R
40|$|Berkshire Hathaway, among history’s {{largest and}} most {{successful}} corporations, shuns middlemen; its chairman, the legendary investor Warren Buffett, excoriates financial intermediaries. The acquisitive conglomerate rarely borrows money, retains brokers, or hires consultants. Its governance is lean, using an advisory board and bucking all forms of corporate bureaucracy. Berkshire’s shareholders also minimize the roles of intermediaries like stockbrokers and stock exchanges by trading little and holding for lengthy periods. By exploring Berkshire’s antipathy to intermediation, this article supports the view that public policy ought to make considerable room for companies to define their own <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> and that more companies ought to consider emulating aspects of Berkshire’s disintermediation. While Buffett’s legacy to date has been to lead two generations of value investors, Berkshire’s radically ingenious disintermediation {{has the potential to}} shape the next two generations of value managers, as argued in this paper and at greater length in the author’s recent book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett: The Enduring Value of Values...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{disaster}} response capabilities {{within this}} country requires better coordination not {{only within the}} Department of Homeland Security, but also across {{the federal government as}} well as with state and local governments, private and non-profit sectors. To do so, according to more than 150 state and local stakeholders that I surveyed in April, 2009 and again in April, 2010, requires that FEMA improve its capacity to fully support state, local and tribal stakeholders … that it improve its <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> so as to better implement federal policies and guidance…that it find a way to use thematic goals and transition forums so as to create a better understanding of prevention, protection and coordination in every region taking into account differences between states and major metropolitan areas. There are at least three strategic national challenges {{that need to be addressed}} in the process of doing so including 1. the shifting of preparedness and protection efforts toward an overall concept of national resiliency 2. building a framework that supports comprehensive and coherent preparedness and 3. ingraining sustainability into all homeland security and emergency management endeavors...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} have looked to research to improve both their <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> and the {{products and services}} they deliver. However, while the potential for benefits resulting from research is significant, there also is risk. Not all research projects are successful. Some projects produce results that are promising but require more development. Further development does not always produce results that are ready to implement. Implementation may fail. Competing products may capture the market. This paper sets forth a preliminary methodology to assess and manage risk for transportation research. The California Dept. of Transportation (Caltrans) funds numerous transportation research projects that range from studies that aim to improve the understanding of travel behavior to field operations tests and deployment studies for new technologies. The risk assessment methodology {{is designed to help}} 1) identify needs for transportation research, 2) identify likely audiences for the anticipated research products, as well as potential applications; 3) identify potential barriers that could impede research or prevent its implementation; and based on the findings of the first three steps, 4) assess whether Caltrans is best suited to fund and oversee the research, should co-‐sponsor it wit...|$|R
40|$|In October 2006, Congress enacted major {{legislation}} {{to reform the}} function and organization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{in response to the}} recognized failures in preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) focused national preparedness responsibilities within FEMA and directed additional resources and responsibilities to FEMA's ten regional offices. Directed by Congress, in October 2008 a National Academy Panel began an independent assessment of FEMA's integration of preparedness functions and progress in development of robust regional offices. Main Findings Over the past three years, FEMA has taken significant steps in an effort to integrate preparedness and develop more robust regional offices. These efforts, undertaken by both the previous and current Administrations, are documented throughout this report and should be recognized and applauded. However, FEMA has yet to define specific goals and outcomes that would permit it, Congress or the public to determine when preparedness has been fully integrated into all aspects of FEMA's work and whether the development and ongoing operation of robust regional offices has been achieved. In the absence of well-defined, measurable outcome indicators, the National Academy Panel relied upon the assessments of FEMA leaders and staff, documentation provided by FEMA, and a review of secondary sources material to inform its findings and recommendations. Based upon this evidence, the Panel has concluded that, while progress has been made: (1) preparedness is not fully integrated across FEMA, (2) FEMA's regional offices do not yet have the capacity required to ensure the nation is fully prepared, (3) stakeholders are not yet full partners with FEMA in national preparedness, and (4) FEMA has ineffective <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> particularly with regard to human resource management. The Panel made seven recommendations for FEMA: Establish a cross-organizational process, with participation from internal and external stakeholders, to develop a shared understanding of preparedness integration Establish a robust set of outcome metrics and standards for preparedness integration, as well as a system to monitor and evaluate progress on an ongoing basis Work to eliminate organizational barriers that are adversely impacting the full integration of preparedness across the agency Continue to build regional office capacity and monitor implementation consistent with the Administrator's recent policy guidance Undertake steps to improve the ongoing working relationship between headquarters and the regions in accord with Panel-identified principles Take steps to improve stakeholder engagement and relationships at all levels in accord with Panel-identified principles; and Strengthen <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> especially in the area of human capital planning...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempted}} to extract {{from the literature}} a package of measures, or metrics, {{that can be used}} by microcredit programs and institutions to gauge their success as financial institutions, as well as their broader societal impact as welfare organizations. What was learned is that microcredit organizations, unlike more traditional financial institutions, are largely unregulated and therefore tend to use of variety of non-standardized measures to assess their success and sustainability. Moreover, it is clear that microfinance institutions can not easily trade-off those measures that track institutional success, for those that measure the well-being of the community as a result of borrowing money and mounting a micro-enterprise, since a number of confounding factors make direct correlation difficult. By employing the Balanced Scorecard framework, microcredit organizations can collect regularly data that reports on the financial status of the organization, its <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> the rate of borrower success, and lessons learned. Moreover, the microcredit organization that assumes to impact the borrower community at large, can use the same framework to aggregate these data across borrower communities and monitor them along with certain health and welfare data to infer a degree of behavioral impact. by Judith B.

40|$|Supply {{of water}} to urban {{households}} by tanker truck in developing and advanced developing countries {{is often associated with}} early stages of urbanization or with the private markets on which water vendors serve households not connected to the piped network. Despite Mexico City's high household network coverage rate and recent improvements in billing, collection, and network maintenance and upgrading, the public sector supplies bulk water to households by truck in response to persistent water scarcity and insufficient network service levels in some areas. Analysis of the public trucked water delivery services in two of Mexico City's sixteen delegations-or districts-shows two distinct paths to improved trucked service performance in a shared new environment of democratic governance. Although both delegation administrations are led by the same political party, in one delegation officials pursue accountability in the public trucked water service through an evolving set of new <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> In the other delegation, organized residents and elected politicians support service accountability through co- production with delegation authorities and external oversight. This thesis asks how and why two distinct models of accountability in trucked water service delivery operate across two Mexico City delegations, and asks what the implications of the distinct accountability models are for improved household access to water. by Jill Pike.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{there has been an}} {{increasing}} national focus on improving the efficiency and accountability of Local Government organisations, particularly with respect to their critical role in the management and operation of public infrastructure assets. Australia’s economic, social and environmental sustainability depends heavily on the ability of municipal authorities to effectively manage the infrastructure assets for which they are ultimately responsible. The Community at large now expect government and private agencies to deliver cost efficiency and life cycle affordability in the provision and maintenance of public infrastructure. Planning for the sustainable provision of essential Community infrastructure has become a key issue now facing the Local Government sector in Australia. In meeting this challenge most municipal authorities have developed corporate level strategies to enhance <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> and demonstrate cost efficiency and lifecycle affordability in the management of infrastructure assets. Corporate goals and objectives have been aligned to reflect changing Community expectations with respect to infrastructure provision, management and financial sustainability. This research project examines the steps taken in the preparation of an Asset Management Improvement Strategy for the City of Mandurah in Western Australia. The strategy is intended to guide the development of existing management processes, systems and data required to support the production and implementation of detailed Asset Management Plans for major infrastructure asset groups. Through the adoption and ultimate implementation of this strategy Council can approach the future with {{confidence in their ability to}} provide the Mandurah Community with “sustainable” service delivery through efficient management and operation of the City’s infrastructure asset portfolio...|$|R

Following the first-time SEC registration of the credit rating agencies in September 2007 under newly enacted legislative authority, he ordered a 10-month examination {{of the three major}} rating agencies that uncovered significant weaknesses in their ratings practices for mortgage-backed securities and that called into question the impartiality of their ratings. The results were reported to Congress in July 2008. The SEC immediately commenced a rulemaking which concluded on December 3, 2008 with approval of a series of measures to regulate the conflicts of interests, disclosures, <b>internal</b> policies, and <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> of credit rating agencies. The regulations were intended to ensure that firms provide more meaningful ratings and greater disclosure to investors concerning collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities.|$|R
40|$|Online retail has {{experienced}} substantial growth {{due to the}} increased utilization of digital technologies. The growth in the industry has created numerous multinational corporations, which serve customers all around the world. As a result, the online retailers’ efforts in sustainability have been more often in publicity. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the efforts going beyond the company’s interest {{in order to bring}} social good, have been discussed in the academic community for decades. While the various effects of CSR in retail and business generally have been realized, the research aims to make a contribution by examining the concept from the viewpoint of online retail by focusing on interaction at online discussion forums. The main research question asks: What is the role of online retailer CSR in the online discussion forum context? In order to answer this question, additional three sub-research questions are suggested: 1) What elements of CSR are relevant in the online retailer context? 2) How are discussion forums used in communication regarding CSR and online retail by different discusser types? 3) What kind of company perceptions and consumer behavior appear in online discussions of Amazon’s CSR? The study is qualitative of nature, using the content analysis research method to examine posts found from four different public online discussion forums. A qualitative, interpretative analysis was used, although quantitative measures regarding discussion posts were also presented. The analysis contains a coding process, where attributes are attached to discussion posts. As a result of the process, specific patterns can be indicated in order to categorize the posts. As the research uses Amazon as the case company, the case study method is also adopted. In the online retail context, ethics regarding the online retailer’s tax and labor policies are found as most relevant elements. Customers, using discussion forums to share their experiences and opinions regarding online retailer CSR efforts, are realized as the most prominent stakeholder. The research also highlights the role of online retailer employees providing details on <b>internal</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> However, the not realize the possibility to participate in discussions. Most discussion posts refer either to a positive, negative or mixed reaction towards CSR efforts, it is suggested that the concept is relevant also in online retail. Although online retailer CSR efforts are somewhat linked to company perceptions, the concept has a minimal role in consumer behavior. In online retail, CSR efforts can reduce the risk of being involved in discussions related to controversies. In addition, online retailer CSR efforts should communicate how the retailer contributes locally...|$|R

40|$|Operational risk incidences {{are likely}} to {{increase}} the degree of information asymmetry between firms and investors. We analyze operational risk disclosures by US financial firms during 1995 – 2009 {{and their impact on}} different measures of information asymmetry in the firms’ equity markets. Effective spreads and the price impact of trades are shown to increase around the first announcements of such events and to revert after the announcement of their settlement. This is especially pronounced for <b>internal</b> fraud and <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> related events. Market makers respond to higher information risk around the first press cutting date by increasing the quoted depth to accommodate an increase in trading volumes. The degree of information asymmetry around operational risk events may be influenced by the bank’s risk management function and the bank’s governance structure. We indeed find that information asymmetry increases more strongly after events’ first announcements when firms have weaker governance structures—lower board independence ratios, lower equity incentives of executive directors, and lower levels of institutional ownership. In contrast, the firms’ risk management function has little to no impact on information asymmetry. We interpret this as evidence that the risk management function is primarily driven by regulatory compliance needs. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of information asymmetry around operational risk announcements. They help to shed light on the role that regulation and corporate governance can play in order to establish effective disclosure practices and to promote a liquid and transparent securities market...|$|R
