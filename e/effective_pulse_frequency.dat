40|$|The linear {{tool wear}} {{compensation}} method (LCM) is commonly applied in micro-EDM 3 -D milling {{to compensate the}} tool length wear {{in order to achieve}} high machining accuracy. Traditional LCMs mainly rely on empirical models and off-line wear measurements, whereas the process dynamics are not taken into account. When machining complex 3 D cavities, an increasing number of tool wear compensation cycles have usually to be performed {{in order to maintain the}} targeted machining accuracy. This negatively affects the duration of the overall machining cycle. To realize efficient precision micro-EDM cavity milling, without the necessity to predefine Z-axis tool feed in the NC trajectory before machining, an in-situ process control system is developed to adaptively control the tool wear compensation factor based on the discharge pulse behavior. Experiments have shown that the change of the compensation factor can be detected and also a continuous increase of the factor (over compensation) leads to the saturation of the mean <b>effective</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency.</b> Pulse monitoring therefore provides valuable information for understanding the process dynamics and for selecting the machining parameters towards better machining efficiency. Furthermore, the information gathered in-situ can be utilized to predict the tool wear and perform in-situ tool wear prediction. To implement this on machine-level, a combined off-line and in-line adaptive control of the tool wear compensation factor is proposed and experimentally validated by milling different 3 D cavities. The off-line adaptive control is only necessary when the predicted machining depth error exceeds a certain limit. In this way, more than 80 % of the off-line adaptive control cycles can be eliminated, whereby a total save of cycle time up to 18 % has been reached, while still maintaining the desired dimensional and form accuracy. status: publishe...|$|E

Forty-five diabetic patients selected from out clinic of Kasr El-Aini Hospital, Cairo University assigned randomly into three groups. The blood flow volume, blood flow velocity and caliper of the blood vessel were evaluated before laser application and after twelve sessions using duplex Doppler ultrasound.

Simulations are used to compare meteoroid speeds determined using the Fresnel transform and alternative techniques, confirming that the Fresnel transform produces the most accurate meteoroid speed estimates for high <b>effective</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition <b>frequencies</b> (PRFs). The Fresnel transform is applied to high effective PRF data collected during Leonid meteor showers, producing speed estimates in good agreement with the theoretical pre-atmospheric speed of the 71 kms ? 1. Further simulations for the standard low effective PRF sampling parameters used for Buckland Park meteor radar (BPMR) observations suggests that the Fresnel transform can successfully estimate meteor speeds up to 80 kms ? 1. Fresnel transform speed estimation is applied using the BPMR, producing speed distributions similar to those obtained in previous studies. The technique is also applied to data collected using the BPMR sampling parameters during Southern delta-Aquarid and Geminid meteor showers, producing speeds in very good agreement with the theoretical pre-atmospheric speeds of these showers (41 kms ? 1 and 35 kms ? 1, respectively). However, application of the Fresnel transform to high speed showers suggests that the practical upper limit for accurate speed estimation using the BPMR sampling parameters is around 50 kms ? 1.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{investigation into}} a fully pulsed jet has been performed {{with a single}} wire hotwire anemometer operated in a constant temperature mode to study the influences of varying mean exit velocity of the jet and <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> on the velocity field and turbulence quantities. The results of radial profile test across the jet show that the pulsed jet is axisymmetric. The test of jet centerline location demonstrates that the jet follows a straight line trajectory to propagate downstream. From the axial measurements, it is shown that the pulsed jet behaves like a steady jet after the pulsation effects have diminished towards furthest downstream locations, hence the existence of two distinct regions namely the pulsed dominated region and the high turbulence steady jet region is proved. However, {{the existence of the}} two distinct regions is strongly dependent on the mean exit velocity and <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> At a high mean exit velocity and a low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> the high turbulence steady jet region can not be identified displaying no transition region. Moreover, at high mean exit velocities with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more slowly along the downstream positions. Amplifications of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence associated with an increasing mean exit velocity contribute to this case. At higher <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequencies</b> with a constant mean exit velocity, the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more rapidly along the downstream positions {{as a result of the}} attenuations of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence. Skewness and flatness along the downstream positions depart from the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively as the mean exit velocity increases with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> At higher <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequencies</b> with a constant mean exit velocity, skewness and flatness become lower in which approach the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively. From the radial measurements, at an increasing <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> with a constant mean exit velocity the radial profile of mean axial velocity becomes narrower. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> narrower radial profiles result. Also, the radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity has smaller levels as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. As the jet propagates downstream the levels of radial distribution of the aggregate turbulence intensity across the jet reduce gradually. At a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> amplification of the root-mean-square level of aggregate turbulence occurs as the mean exit velocity is increased which leads to the higher levels of radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity. Moreover, the radial profile of relative turbulence energy becomes broader as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. However, there is some evidence demonstrating the narrower radial profiles as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> increases. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant mean exit velocity, a broader radial profile is produced. The levels of triple-products across the jet reduce as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity but the levels increase as a result of an increasing mean exit velocity at a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> Skewness and flatness in the radial direction are relatively lower at an increasing <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> with a constant mean exit velocity whereas at an increasing mean exit velocity with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> their values become higher. Furthermore, the jet volume flow rate relative to that at the jet exit significantly reduces as the Reynolds number increases. The jet growth and normalized volume flow rates are found to be higher than that of steady jets even up to further downstream position associated with the broadening radial profiles of mean axial velocity. At the low mean exit velocity of 13. 7 m/s, the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> of 10 Hz are higher than those at the high <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> of 25 Hz. However, as compared with the jet growth and volume flow rate phenomena at the low mean exit velocity of 13. 7 m/s, a striking issue appears at the high mean exit velocity of 34. 4 m/s demonstrating that the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> are lower than those at the high <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|R

A 350 nm continuous wave flash lamb, with output configuration close to that of the 3 rd harmonic of the laser, was also used for the purpose of comparison. The result indicates that the log reductions for the laser wavelengths are higher (almost double) that of continuous wave light. When E. coli and L. monocytogenes samples were irradiated with the 3 rd harmonic wavelength using three different <b>pulse</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the result shows higher deactivation at higher <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> than at lower <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. Two {{groups of}} mares {{were exposed to}} an abrupt, {{artificial}} increase or a natural increase in daylength. In both groups, mean LH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> increased with time of year and {{was accompanied by a}} reciprocal decrease in LH pulse amplitude. A non-pulsatile pattern of LH secretion was observed in some mares sampled close to the day of ovulation. Maximum mean LH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> and the onset of the breeding season occurred earlier in those mares exposed to an abrupt artificial increase in daylength. In blood samples collected frequently, mean serum LH concentrations increased in relation to time of year. However, during 60 days before ovulation, when LH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> increased, mean daily serum LH values only increased on Day =n- before ovulation. The magnitude of the periovulatory LH rise was greater before the second than the first ovulation of the breeding season. These results support the hypothesis that, in the mare, a photoperiod-induced seasonal alteration in LH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> and/or amplitude {{may play a role in}} the onset of the breeding season...|$|R

Influence of {{the pulse}} currents, the <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> and CoSO 4 content of plating {{solution}} on Co content of Ni-Co alloy coatings are investigated by environmental {{scanning electronic microscopy}} and field emission scanning electronic microscope. The result shows that Co content of Ni-Co alloy coating increases as the increase of CoSO 4 content and <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency.</b> Co content of Ni-Co alloy coating increases when the current density decrease. When CoSO 4 content of plating solution and the <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> increase, the coating surface become smoother, microstructure become denser and coating grain refinement. when current density is small, coating crystalline grains size are tiny and the coating crystalline grains arrangement is relatively close. In the Ni-Co electrodepositing process, the combining of N...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that different GnRH pulse frequen-cies will affect serum LH and FSH differently. Ovariectomized gilts (n = 6), immunized against GnRH, were given 200 -ng puls-es of GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) every 180 min for 3 days (pre-treatment), followed by GnRH-A pulses every 30, 60, or 180 min for 3 days (treatment) in a Latin rectangle design. Mean gonad-otropin concentrations did not change over time when GnRH pulses were administered every 180 min. Initiation of high GnRH-A <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> (30 min) caused a robust increase in serum LH to 265 % of the pretreatment level (p < 0. 007) and a more moderate increase in serum FSH to 127 % of pretreatment level (p- 0. 02). After 66 h of frequent pulsing, desensitization had occurred and serum LH concentrations were similar to pre-treatment concentrations, but serum FSH had decreased to 53 % of pretreatment levels (p < 0. 0008). After 72 h of treatment, 5 pFg GnRH-A was infused to estimate residual releasable pools of LH and FSH, and the amounts of LH and FSH released were negatively correlated with GnRH-A <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency.</b> The {{results of this study}} imply that the LH surge is terminated because the pituitary gland becomes incapable of responding to an other-wise adequate stimulus, and not because of exhaustion of re-leasable LH pools. Our results confirm that in the pig the re-sponse to altered GnRH-A <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> differs between LH and FSH. High GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> is more <b>effective</b> in acute-ly releasing LH than FSH. Low <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> of GnRH sup-ports FSH synthesis and release, but is not as effective in in-creasing LH concentrations, while high GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> inhibits FSH synthesis and release...|$|R

40|$|Cobalt {{nanowire}} arrays {{have been}} grown onto anodic aluminum oxide templates {{by using a}} pulse dc electrodeposition technique. We demonstrate that the crystal structure, grain size, and related magnetic properties can be controlled by applying different <b>pulse</b> <b>frequencies.</b> For a <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency</b> of 25  Hz, monocrystalline hexagonal-close-packed Co nanowires are formed with a well defined [10 math 0] growth axis along the wire length.
