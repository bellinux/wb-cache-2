40|$|This {{project is}} part of a {{collaborative}} MSc training programme between the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and Cranfield University, aiming at enhancing the competitiveness of AVIC in both international and domestic aviation market through applying continuing airworthiness policies in the whole aircraft development process. The arrangement of the research project is that all students start with a Group Design Project which is based on the Flying Crane Project provided by AVIC. Individual research projects will address some aspects of the Flying Crane Project during the Group Design Project, and then further developed during the period for individual projects. The aim of this research is to apply the airworthiness requirements and the methodology of the Maintenance Steering Group logic (MSG- 3) in the Flying Crane Project. This is because that maintenance {{is one of the key}} factors of Continuing Airworthiness, and MSG- 3 logic is the most accepted and approved method to develop scheduled maintenance for civil aircrafts. The main objectives of this project include: (1) To investigate current Continuing Airworthiness regulations, including European airworthiness requirements (as the main regulation to comply with) and Chinese airworthiness regulations (as an important reference and supplement to the research); (2) To investigate the main analysis methodology of reliability and maintainability, including Damage Tolerance and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA); (3) To analyse the data resulted from the Group Design Project using MSG- 3 logic to produce a set of Continuing Airworthiness instructions, for the operator and maintenance organisation of the aircraft, from the design organization’s perspective; (4) To develop Continuing Airworthiness instructions for airline operators to compose maintenance programmes for Flying Crane aircrafts, including maintenance tasks and intervals for the selected airframe systems and structural components; and (5) To identify applicable maintenance organisations in China for Flying Crane aircrafts in accordance with both European and Chinese airworthiness requirements. On completion of this research, two aspects of Continuing Airworthiness have been investigated, including maintenance programme and maintenance organization. With MSG- 3 logic, the author developed the maintenance plan for three structural components (<b>fuselage</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panel,</b> wing root joint, and fin-fuselage attachment) and one airframe system (fuel system) based on results from the Group Design Project. The author also investigated the Chinese domestic aircraft maintenance companies, and selected suitable maintenance organizations based on technical and economical criteria...|$|E

The aircraft made an emergency descent, and after landing, was found to have a [...] hole approximately [...] long on top of the fuselage above the passenger cabin. The NTSB investigation revealed evidence of pre-existing fatigue, and determined the probable cause of the incident to be related to an error in the manufacturing process for joining <b>fuselage</b> crown <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> This incident led to the FAA increasing the inspection rate of certain airframes. The incident followed a similar one, Southwest Airlines Flight 2294, in 2009.|$|R
50|$|For the {{aircraft}} production number 292 (B-737) and after (this aircraft was production line number 152), an additional outer layer of skin or doubler sheet at the lap joint of the fuselage was added. In {{the construction of}} this aircraft this doubler sheet was not used {{in addition to other}} details of the bonding of the parts. In the case of production line 292 and after, this doubler sheet gave an additional thickness of 0.91 mm at the lap joint. In airplane line number 291 and before, cold bonding had been utilized, with fasteners used to maintain surface contact in the joint, allowing bonding adhesive to transfer load within the joint. This cold bonded joint used an epoxy-impregnated woven scrim cloth to join the edges of 0.9 mm thick <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> These epoxy cloths were reactive at room temperature, so they were stored at dry ice temperatures until used in manufacture. The bond cured at room temperature after assembly. The cold bonding process reduced the overall weight and manufacturing cost. Fuselage hoop loads (circumferential loads within the skins due to pressurization of the cabin) were intended to be transferred through the bonded joint, rather than through the rivets, allowing the use of lighter, thinner <b>fuselage</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> with no degradation in fatigue life.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft <b>fuselage</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> {{are joined}} {{together}} by rivets. The initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks in aircraft structures at {{and around the}} rivet/skin interface {{is directly related to}} residual stress field induced during the riveting process and subsequent service loads. Variations in the manufacturing process, such as applied loading and presence of sealant can influence the induced residual stress field. In previous research, the riveting process has been simulated by a 2 D axisymmetric force-controlled analysis. The 2 D analysis cannot capture the unsymmetrical residual stress state resulting from process variations. Experimental work has also been limited to observing effects of squeeze force on fatigue crack initiation in the riveted lap joint. In this work, a 3 D finite element model of the riveting process that incorporates plasticity and contact between the various surfaces is simulated using ABAQUS finite element code to capture the residual stress state at the rivet/skin interface. The finite element model is implemented to observe the effects of interference, sealant and hole quality on the residual stress state using Implicit and Explicit solvers. Effects of subsequent load transfer are also analyzed with the developed model. A set of controlled lap joint fatigue experiments for the different conditions provides validation to the model. Ph. D.

40|$|Engineering (KE) {{techniques}} can be applied. In general, knowledge engineering techniques {{consists of a}} broad scale of tools and techniques to convert engineering knowledge into a knowledge model. Among these methodologies are MOKA 1, CommonKADS 2 and the 47 -Step Procedure 3. A suitable application to support knowledge engineering is PCPACK 4. A practical application is chosen to demonstrate the use of KE techniques in a real-life situation. The example that is chosen is the design of Fibre Metal Laminate (FML) <b>fuselage</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> for the Airbus A 380 aircraft at Stork Fokker AESP, Papendrecht, The Netherlands. Within the FML engineering process, various opportunities for KBE applications are identified. The most beneficial KBE application is the automation of the sub-division process of the prepreg plies. The sub-division process of the prepreg plies accounts for approximately 20 % of the total production preparation time. The produced informal model of the design process is used to produce a KBE application. With respect to the traditional prepreg sub-division process, a lead-time reduction of 75 % can be gained using this KBE application. In contrast to the theoretical development time, the development time for the KBE system is equal to approximately six design cycles of the traditional prepreg ply sub-division process. The results of the KBE application {{in relation to the}} design made by the design engineer are highly accurate. The prepreg cutting waste can be reduced by 50 % for the basic laminate of the panels. I...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{aircraft}} design {{is focusing on}} novel aircraft configurations in search for a step change in terms of overall transport efficiency. Aircraft design relies heavily on empirical methods, so-called Class 2 methods, to evaluate {{the performance of a}} design. Since these methods are based on statistical data their validity is limited when these are used for the design of novel aircraft. There is therefore a strong need for methods that are valid for the conceptual {{aircraft design}} of these novel aircraft. The method proposed in this thesis is a semi-analytical method for estimating the weight of a fuselage constructed using the oval fuselage concept. The oval fuselage is a concept for a wide unobstructed pressurized cabin specifically useful for Blended Wing Body aircraft. A parameterization of the oval fuselage is presented and it is demonstrated that the oval cross-section can be used for the design of conventional tube-and-wing aircraft with a single-deck or twin-deck layout as well as for blended-wing-body aircraft. It is also shown that the oval cross-section allows for additional design freedom of the fuselage shape without introducing any bending loads in the <b>fuselage</b> <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> Using this parameterization, a method is presented for estimating the weight of this fuselage when used in conventional and novel aircraft configurations. The weight estimation of the fuselage is based on the combination of pressurization loads, steady-state maneuver loads, aerodynamic loads and landing loads. Each of the structural members of the inner structure is sized based on two-dimensional structural analysis satisfying requirements on bi-axial strength, global buckling, crippling, dimpling, and wrinkling. The outer structure is sized using a global buckling criteria adapted from cylinders and a local buckling criteria based on buckling of slender plates. Empirical methods are used to calculate the nonstructural weight and additional weight. A verification of the structural analysis method by a finite-element analysis shows that the made assumptions for the analysis of the structure are valid within the application of aircraft fuselage design. The weight estimation method is compared with weight estimation methods from the open literature and with weight data of existing aircraft. The accuracy of the weight estimation {{is similar to that of}} empirical methods for circular fuselages. Examples are shown of oval fuselages in aircraft designs and weight estimations are performed on these fuselages to form a basis for future research on this subject.

40|$|Peen forming is a {{manufacturing}} process {{commonly used in}} the aerospace industry to shape large and thin panels such as wing and <b>fuselage</b> <b>skins</b> and rocket <b>panels.</b> Due to the large size of the components, this process is generally performed by moving the parts through a peening enclosure or by moving peening equipment following a trajectory on the parts. Previous research on peen forming simulation has rarely considered {{the influence of the}} peening pattern on the resulting deformed shape. The purpose of this work was therefore to evaluate experimentally and numerically this effect using small scale tests. A simple model was proposed to simulate incremental deflections as the shot stream traveled over the samples. Model parameters were calibrated experimentally and then applied to a different geometry for validation. Finite element analyses correctly predicted the complex radius distribution arising from the peening path and the constraints applied to the sample during peening. 9 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical study of decentralized velocity feedback control {{systems for the}} reduction of sound transmission through double panels. The system studied consists of two plates which are coupled acoustically by {{the air in the}} cavity between them and structurally by four elastic mounts. The geometrical and material properties of the double panel have been chosen so as to approximate a section of an aircraft <b>fuselage</b> <b>skin.</b> The outer <b>panel</b> of the <b>skin</b> (the source <b>panel)</b> is excited by oblique plane waves and the consequent sound power radiated from the inner panel (the radiating panel) is calculated. First, a parametric study of passive sound transmission of double panels with different geometrical and material properties is carried out. Second, active vibration control is implemented using 16 decentralized direct velocity feedback loops. Performance of such a control system is assessed for four control cases. The first two cases deal with skyhook force actuators with collocated velocity sensors, which implement active damping either on the source panel or on the radiating panel. In the third case, skyhook actuators and collocated velocity sensors are located on both panels. Finally, an approach using actuators that react between the two panels with collocated relative velocity sensors is considered...|$|R

40|$|Since mid 30 s (Theory of Elastic Stability, Timoshenko, 1936) up to now, {{buckling}} {{of plates}} subjected to in plane combined loadings {{has been a}} matter of concern for many investigators in structural engineering. When buckling occurs, there is a sudden change in deformation state, which occurs at the critical load. Being able to determine the critical stress for a given loading condition is of remarkable importance in aeronautical industry. There are some areas at which it is of paramount importance to know under which load the structure buckles, to design it appropriately. In some other areas, like the skins of aerodynamic surfaces, buckling needs to be avoided so as not to change the geometry of the aerodynamic surface. This phenomena occurs, among other structures, in plates, such as <b>fuselage</b> or wing <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> Those panels or sheets in the wing, fuselage or other parts are subjected to combination of complex loadings. For instance, the upper surface of an aircraft wing in flight may be subjected to combined shear and compressive stress. Wing panels are delimited by spanwise stiffeners and chordwise ribs. Note that the panels in the wing are not flat but slightly curved. The buckling load of those panels can be computed assuming they are flat, because it is a conservative estimate (curved panels have greater buckling loads). To solve flat plates buckling problems for different loadings and boundary conditions, currently two different methods are used; the analytical method and the Finite Element Method. This work will compare the flat plates combined loadings buckling results obtained analytically with those obtained from Finite Element Method. Ingeniería Aeroespacia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In the {{competitive}} environment of aircraft industries it becomes absolutely necessary {{to improve the}} efficiency, performance of the aircrafts to reduce the development and operating costs considerably, in order to capitalize the market. An important contribution to improve the efficiency and performance {{can be achieved by}} decreasing the aircraft weight through considerable usage of composite materials in primary aircraft structures.

40|$|The goal of Boeing's Advanced Technology Composite Aircraft Structures (ATCAS) {{program is}} to develop the {{technology}} required for cost-and weight-efficient use of composite materials in transport fuselage structure. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy was chosen for <b>fuselage</b> <b>skins</b> and stiffening elements, and for passenger and cargo floor structures. The automated fiber placement (AFP) process was selected for fabrication of stringer-stiffened and sandwich <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> Circumferential and window frames were braided and resin transfer molded (RTM'd). Pultrusion was selected for fabrication of floor beams and constant-section stiffening elements. Drape forming was chosen for stringers and other stiffening elements cocured to skin structures. Significant process development efforts included AFP, braiding, RTM, autoclave cure, and core blanket fabrication for both sandwich and stiffened-skin structure. Outer-mold-line and inner-mold-line tooling was developed for sandwich structures and stiffened-skin structure.
