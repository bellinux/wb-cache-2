25|$|Starting {{in early}} 1965, Park {{produced}} {{a number of}} amplifiers including a 45-watt head. Most of these had Marshall layout and components, though some unusual amplifiers were made, such as a 75 watt keyboard amplifier with KT88 tubes. A 2×12-inch combo {{had the option of}} sending the first channel into the second, probably inspired by Marshall users doing the same trick with a <b>jumper</b> <b>cable.</b> The 1972 Park 75 put out about 100 watts by way of two KT88s, whereas the comparable 50-watt Model 1987 of that time used 2 EL34 tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Car {{batteries}} {{are most likely}} to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Such batteries produce hydrogen, which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of electrolysis of the water in the electrolyte). During normal use, the amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen, which dissipates quickly. However, when [...] "jump starting" [...] a car, the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark, e.g. when disconnecting a <b>jumper</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most diesel {{locomotives}} {{are capable of}} multiple unit operation (MU) {{as a means of}} increasing horsepower and tractive effort when hauling heavy trains. All North American locomotives, including export models, use a standardized AAR electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a consist are referred to as trainlines. [...] The result is that all locomotives in a consist behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrical}} control system required control cables throughout {{the length of}} the train (in addition to the two air pipes for Westinghouse operation) and a <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> was provided at each end of every unit for use when two or more units were coupled to run in multiple. In 1950, no electronic control was possible and the system used four conductors in the cable to achieve graduated braking rates.|$|E
50|$|During 2015, the Class 15E fleet {{began to}} be {{equipped}} with new multiple unit (MU) hardware and train control and monitoring system (TCMS) software. Modified locomotives carried temporary plaques on their front doors {{to indicate that the}} modification had been carried out and to warn train crews that the locomotive may not be connected to an unmodified locomotive by multiple unit <b>jumper</b> <b>cable.</b> Modified locomotives could only be used with unmodified locomotives through the radio distributed power system.|$|E

5000|$|A jump wire (also {{known as}} jumper, jumper wire, <b>jumper</b> <b>cable,</b> DuPont wire, or DuPont cable - named for one {{manufacturer}} of them) is an electrical wire {{or group of}} them in a cable with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply [...] "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.|$|E
50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices. For example, corroded <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.|$|E
50|$|Wrexham & Shropshire started {{operating}} push-pull {{services with}} DVTs in October 2008 between Wrexham General and London Marylebone {{in conjunction with}} Class 67 diesel locomotives following {{the start of the}} service on 28 April 2008. The DVTs required modification to work with the Class 67, involving adding a notched power controller as is used in the locomotive and a 27 wire <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> as used on the GM EMD locomotives which is known as the AAR Multiple Working system. These DVTs were originally used by Virgin Trains until the Pendolinos were fully operational.|$|E

25|$|Various {{carriages}} were fitted or retrofitted with <b>jumper</b> <b>cables</b> {{to allow}} their operation in a railcar train. There were at least 88 trailers in total, including pre-1950s stock (one example dating from 1902), 1950s CIÉ vehicles, other 1950s stock from Park Royal Vehicles (manufacturer of the railcars' own bodywork) and 1960s Cravens vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, it {{is noted}} that other letter designations were used {{temporarily}} involving an extra [...] "A" [...] preceding the unit name. This was done as Standards were being modified {{in regard to}} their <b>jumper</b> <b>cable</b> connections. This work went on from approximately 1928 to 1931, and during those years one could see units carrying designations [...] "AA," [...] "AB," [...] or [...] "ABX." [...] The extra [...] "A" [...] signified that the car had been so equipped. These designations with the extra [...] "A" [...] prefix were temporary, and when the entire fleet of Standards had been so equipped by 1931 or 1932, the extra [...] "A" [...] prefix was dropped from the designations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} blocks {{are used}} to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks {{are used to}} terminate inside plant equipment.
