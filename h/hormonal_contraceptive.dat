Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is some {{evidence}} that endogenous progesterone and oestrogen levels influence asthma severity in females, but {{little is known about the}} effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> This study aimed to describe how females with asthma perceived the effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> on symptom severity, and to describe the association between asthma severity and current use of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> A questionnaire was sent to 891 females with asthma aged 20 – 30 yrs recruited from general practice registers in South London, UK. It asked about perceptions of the effects of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> on asthma severity, about current use of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> and included an asthma quality of life questionnaire as a measure of asthma severity. About 6 % of respondents who had ever used <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> reported that these had influenced asthma severity, ~ 4 % reporting worsening and 2 % an im-provement. There were no significant differences in asthma quality of life score be-tween females currently taking <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and those not, between those taking combined and progesterone-only preparations, or between users of different progestagen types. This study found no evidence of any important effect of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> or their components on asthma severity in a group of females with relatively mild asthma...|$|R

25|$|In early 1951, {{reproductive}} physiologist Gregory Pincus, {{a leader}} in hormone research and co-founder of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, first met American birth control movement founder Margaret Sanger at a Manhattan dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, medical director {{and vice president of}} Planned Parenthood (PPFA), who helped Pincus obtain a small grant from PPFA to begin <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> research. Research started on April 25, 1951 with reproductive physiologist Min Chueh Chang repeating and extending the 1937 experiments of Makepeace et al. that showed injections of progesterone suppressed ovulation in rabbits. In October 1951, G. D.

25|$|Insufficient {{evidence}} exists on whether {{changes in the}} endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective {{that the possibility of}} fertilization during combined <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} the effect of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use in women on the frequency of sexual intercourse. Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles.

Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods.|$|E

5|$|Combined <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> {{include both}} an {{estrogen}} and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|R

2500|$|NET {{is used as}} a <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> in {{combination}} with an estrogen – usually ethinylestradiol (EE) – in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. NET has also been proven to be effective in inhibiting LH and FSH levels in men as well. Without these hormones, mature sperm cannot survive in the testes. This means that NET could also be an effective male <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive.</b> Aside from its use as a contraceptive, NET can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menopausal symptoms ({{in combination}} with estrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases and in treating non responsive cyclical mastalgia.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Ludwig Haberlandt {{demonstrated}} a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal. By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined {{the structure of}} the steroid hormones and found that high doses of androgens, oestrogens or progesterone inhibited ovulation. [...] A number of economic, technological, and social obstacles had to be overcome before the development of the first <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive,</b> the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). [...] In 1957 Enovid, the first COCP, was approved in the United States for the treatment of menstrual disorders.

2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptive</b> formulations: {{combined}} methods which contain both an estrogen and a progestin, and progestogen-only methods which contain only progesterone or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). [...] Combined methods work by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. [...] The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, breakthrough bleeding is much more common with progestogen-only methods. [...] Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed {{to be caused by}} progestogen-only formulations: deep vein thrombosis is one example of this.|$|E

Design Nationwide registry-based study based on merged data from the Norwegian Prescription Database, the Norwegian Population Registry, the Regular General Practitioner Database and the Medical Birth Registry. Setting Norway. Sample All women born abroad to two foreign-born parents (immigrants), or born in Norway to two Norwegian-born parents (natives) aged 16 – 45 years, who lived in Norway in 2008. Methods Data on all collected supplies of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> in 2008 were merged with demographic, socio-economic and immigration data, information on any delivery and women&# 39;s general practitioners. Main outcome measures User rates of hormonal contraception and predictors of contraceptive use. Results A total of 893 073 women were included, of whom 130 080 were immigrants. More native women (38 %) used <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> compared with all immigrant groups (15 – 24 %). The odds ratios for any use of <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> for immigrants compared with Norwegian-born women were; Nordic countries 0. 53, South and Central America 0. 53, Western countries 0. 39, Asia 0. 30, Eastern Europe 0. 29, Africa 0. 29.

The study population consisted of 79 female elite athletes between the ages of 18 to 45. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> were used by 32 % of the subjects. A full urinary steroid profile was obtained using World Anti-Doping Agency accredited methods. In addition all subjects were genotyped for copy number variation of UGT 2 B 17 and SNPs in UGT 2 B 7 and CYP 17. Subjects using <b>hormonal</b> <b>contraceptives</b> excreted 40 % less epitestosterone as compared to non-users (p = 0. 005) but showed no difference in testosterone excretion.

It is of great importance that the athlete’s steroidal passport can compensate for all possible normal variability in steroid profiles from women.
