40|$|The United States Government {{has been}} {{concerned}} about Third World Women for some time now, especially since the terrorist attack of 9 / 11. The US Government has been interested in these women in a very particular way feeling a sort of political mission to save them from their oppressive men and culture. This attitude has already been interrogated and criticized by many feminist scholars (<b>Ferguson</b> <b>2007</b> et al) and hence, in my research I focus on a different approach deriving from the UNSC Resolution 1325 (2000) aiming to empower women in conflict and postconflict settings. This paper critically looks at the US policy on Resolution 1325 from a transnational feminist perspective. I use the What’s the Problem Represented to Be?-approach to the interrogation of a selection of US policy documents.

30|$|The {{biomaterial}} {{used for}} skin bioprinting should be printable, degradable, possess enough mechanical properties and biocompatible with immobilized cells (Müller et al. 2015). Most importantly, bioink needs {{to exist in}} two different phases and should be capable to change from one form to another. It should have a liquid phase with subsequent solidification to keep rigid form once printed. The solidification process of bioink should be slow enough to avoid clogging of the nozzle. However, if it sets very slowly {{the structure of the}} resulting construct will be affected (Xu et al. 2014). It should have adequate structural stability and strength as well as enough stability in aqueous media. Such bioink material should support and preferably enhance cell viability, distribution/migration, proliferation, differentiation and formation of appropriate tissue. It should allow cell–cell adhesion and paracrine signalling (Metcalfe and <b>Ferguson</b> <b>2007</b> a). The biomaterial itself should be biocompatible and should also enhance cell attachment and migration. In addition, they should also be suitable for the incorporation of other materials and active agents that provide functional or structural support to the printed construct.|$|E
30|$|The {{first attempt}} in this {{direction}} {{is the use of}} synthetic degradable gels as a way to deliver cells and/or molecules in situ, the so-called smart matrix technology (Metcalfe and <b>Ferguson</b> <b>2007).</b> The smart bioengineering concept relies on the ability of cells to sense and to adapt to their environment, and to behave in accordance with the status of the wound. Such smart skin substitutes may use different and multiple mechanisms of action for acute and chronic wounds. The success of a bioengineered skin depends on the ability of the material to stimulate the endogenous healing process (Falanga et al. 2002). Incorporation of active agents that can stimulate cell migration and proliferation is a novel approach in bioengineered skin substitutes. Vincent et al. reported that the release of cytokines and growth factors from the cells seeded in the bioengineered skin can accelerate the migration and proliferation of cells from the wound edge (Falanga et al. 2002). Bioengineered skin substitutes are manufactured by starting with a few human cells in which tissue engineers simulate the environments that allow cells to develop into viable tissue.|$|E
30|$|With {{the advance}} in {{research}} on biochemical factors that control and direct cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, biomaterials designed to incorporate and enable controlled release of bioactive factors after transplantation provide local induction of cellular behaviors (Kearney and Mooney, 2013). Cells respond {{to a variety of}} stimuli present in the ECM, which compose of fibrous proteins, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, and act as a main regulatory and structural component of tissues in vivo. Biomaterials incorporating bioactive factors (e.g. growth factors) have been extensively investigated in tissue engineering (Lutolf and Hubbell, 2005). In order to recruit endogenous cells for enhanced tissue regeneration and repair, growth factors, such as TGF-β, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), VEGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), have been further modified to be controlled release from biomaterials (Metcalfe and <b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007).</b> For biomaterials lacking cell and growth factor binding sites (e.g. alginate, poly(bis(pcarboxy) methane anhydride), poly(propylene fumarate)), RGD peptides have been supplemented to incorporate growth factors such as rhBMP- 2 (Kolambkar et al., 2011) and osteogenic thrombin peptide (Hedberg et al., 2005).|$|E

40|$|Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) {{is a well}} {{established}} intervention technique for improving word retrieval in people with aphasia. This technique uses features of target words to activate semantic networks and thereby improve word retrieval as supported by the spreading activation theory of semantic processing (Collins & Loftus, 1975). Variations of this intervention technique have been successful at improving word retrieval of some people with aphasia (e. g., Boyle, 2004; Coelho, McHugh, & Boyle, 2000; Peach & Reuter, 2010; Wambaugh & <b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007).</b> As {{part of an effort}} to increase the effectiveness of semantic treatments such as SFA, semantic feature knowledge of people with aphasia has been examined in depth (Cox, 2009; Germani & Pierce 1995; Mason-Baughman, 2009; Mason-Baughman, 2010; Vecchi, 1994). For purposes of this research, feature knowledge refers to the ability to identify that a feature belongs to a particular target word during a sorting task as described below.

40|$|Video {{games have}} rapidly {{advanced}} to give gamers a more ‘lifelike’ experience, providing as much realistic details as possible, {{and are now}} integrating virtual and augmented reality. Past literature suggests violent video games and increased aggression may be correlated (Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Bushman, 2001), whereas a recent meta-analysis (<b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007)</b> argues {{there is a lack}} of evidence to support that relationship. The purpose of the current study was to examine if realistic violence in video games can prime aggression. Participants (N = 75) played one of four video games (Tetris, Paintball, Halo, and Battlefield) for 10 minutes and then completed a short word completion task (Anderson, Carnagey, 2 ̆ 6 Eubanks, 2003) aimed at measuring aggressive thought accessibility. A one-way ANOVA failed to identify significant differences between video game groups, F (3, 72) = 1. 40, p =. 25 on aggressive thought. However, a significant ordinal relationship was identified where participants who played games with more realistic violence also demonstrated more aggressive thought, rs =. 24, p =. 02 (one-tailed). These results suggest that the amount of violence experienced in a video game may influence not only whether a person is primed for aggression, but also the strength of that priming. These findings may also help to explain the inconsistent results of prior research...|$|E
40|$|The {{sociology}} {{of the body}} is a newly established subfield of sociology that examines a wide range of embodied dynamics including human and nonhu-man bodies, human reproduction, body fluids, biotechnology, and genetics, along with theories of embodiment, changing bodies, life course and the body, and unequal bodies (American Sociological Association Section on the Sociology of the Body and Embodiment 2010). In the past few decades, sociology has begun to recognize the importance of the body as a subject of scholarly inquiry. In 1995 Sage Publications launched the journal Body & Society, and in 2009 the American Sociological Association (ASA) Sociology of the Body and Embodiment section was formed. Corresponding to these developments have also been changes in the classroom. Sociology of the body and related courses have now emerged in college classrooms throughout the nation. In addition, an ASA {{sociology of}} the body syllabi set (Anderson and <b>Ferguson</b> <b>2007)</b> is available to instructors. Indeed, this climate encourages both scholarly engagement with and pedagogical instruction about the social body.

40|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the fact that}} specific emotions can arise spontaneously, appraisal theorists {{have suggested that the}} emotion-antecedent appraisal process can be automatic (Ekman, 1992; Frijda, 1993; Lazarus, 1991; Scherer, 1993). Support for the automaticity of individual appraisal components has been obtained with various experimental research methods. Attentional bias research supports the automatic nature of novelty and goal relevance appraisals (Gati & Ben-Shakar, 1990). Affective priming studies suggest the automaticity of intrinsic pleasantness (Draine & Greenwald, 1998) and goal (in) congruence appraisals (Moors, De Houwer, Hermans, & Eelen, 2005). Other experimental tasks reveal that appraisals of agency/intentionality can be automatic (Hassin, Aarts, & <b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007).</b> Finally, studies on the automatic assessment of control (Aarts, 2007) and relative power (Moors & De Houwer, 2005) suggest the possibility of automatic appraisal of coping potential. I present a variant of the affective priming task in which primes are events in a pacman game and targets are words to which participants have to give speeded responses. This task allows us to investigate the automaticity of several appraisal components. In a recent set of studies, we used it to further investigate the automaticity of the appraisal of coping potential. I describe the first results obtained with this task. I also discuss the difficulty to disentangle coping potential and valence in this task. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{following}} study is to discover if people think children with autism should be disciplined differently than average children. The participants were 68 undergraduate psychology students attending Winona State University. The participants watched a brief video clip of a child throwing a tantrum. They were then given a questionnaire to fill out regarding the child’s behavior and levels of discipline. Half {{of the participants were}} told the child in the video had autism and half were told nothing about the child. It was found that participants rated the child with less harsh discipline if they were told the child has autism and with more harsh discipline if they were told nothing about the child. Perceptions of Proper Discipline for Average versus Autistic Children The inspiration for this research came from a case study. It consisted of a mother discussing her son, who has autism, and their experience with schooling. The mother told her son’s first teacher about his autism and discovered that this teacher let him do whatever he wanted, despite some behaviors being against the rules. For the rest of his schooling the mother did not tell her son’s teachers about his autism and found that they treated him like the average children. The researcher intends to find out if this effect is generalizable to a larger population and some possible reasons for it. Some of the most common characteristics of autism are impaired ability in social interaction, communication deficits, and stereotypical behaviors such as being unemotional and withdrawn (Harnum, Duffy, & <b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007).</b> As a result of having these characteristics...|$|E
30|$|Skin is the {{outermost}} protecting sheath of human body {{and is in}} direct contact with the external environment which makes it highly susceptible to injury. Skin defects or wounds are common which may result from trauma, skin diseases, burn or removal of skin during surgery (Coyer et al. 2015). Such circumstances require immediate therapeutic interventions to regain the structure and function of the skin and allow the usual mobility of the patient. Superficial wounds can lead to the bacterial invasion and related complications if not treated immediately (Horiuchi et al. 2010). Moreover, even minor deformities bring psychological distress on the affected individuals, especially to children. The best option of skin tissue engineering is the use of autografts though it is limited by the amount and size of available grafts besides other factors such as creation of a secondary wound and other risks (Zöller et al. 2014). Other types of skin grafts such as allografts and possibly xenografts are associated with the risks of immune reactions and transmission of diseases besides some ethical and cultural issues (Nunery 2001). Wound dressing materials such as those based on polymers or their combinations with other substances have largely been developed but they are not living and hardly can be cellularized and replaced by native tissue (Abrigo et al. 2014). In this regard, tissue engineering holds great promises for improving the treatment of skin defects by providing solutions for the challenges such as lack of multi-layered native skin architecture and vascular networks in the constructs (Jank et al. 2017). This approach provides some solutions where besides biomaterial, living cells, biological or chemical signals are being used with the purpose of forming functional skin (Metcalfe and <b>Ferguson</b> <b>2007</b> b). However, such conventional tissue engineering approaches suffer from inherent problems of non-homogeneous distribution of cells, failure to integrate and vascularize upon implantation with subsequent rejection of the implanted biomaterial along with formed skin (Verseijden et al. 2010). Although, some tissue engineered skin products are in market, many limiting factors such as vascularization through the skin substitute which remains a major and critical limiting factor in the clinical success (MacNeil 2007).|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores adult-child {{relationships}} {{and the use}} of touch in residential child care. The discourses surrounding touch in residential child care are distinctly polarised: touch is identified as being both fundamental to child development and also feared as a result of increasing risk aversion resulting from the legacy of abuse scandals in the sector (Cooke, 2003; Steckley, 2012). There is currently a dearth of empirical research regarding how touch is used in residential child care, particularly with regards to observations of touch in practice. This research therefore contributes to filling this gap in research by utilising ethnographic methods of participant observation, semi-structured and ethnographic interviews to explore how staff members and children conceptualise, use and/or avoid physical touch in day-to-day practice. This research is examined through a lifespace framework and draws upon theories of intimacy in order to link the findings to wider sociological theories of relationships (Smith, 2005; Jamieson, 1998, 2011). By carrying out sustained observations of practice, this research examines how touch, as a facet of adult-child relationships in residential child care, is negotiated within the lifespace. It shows how intimacy is both cultivated and inhibited, thus contributing theoretically to wider sociological debates concerning adult-child {{relationships and}} touching practices, particularly in relation to professional relationships and intimacy (Morgan, 2009; Ferguson, 2011 a). The fieldwork for this project took place over 6 months at Sunnydale House, a local authority children’s home in England. The findings suggest that touch is used much more regularly than has been previously suggested in literature (Ward, 1999; Cooke, 2003), that the majority of touch is instigated by children not workers and that recent organisational culture shifts have shaped the way that workers conceptualise touch. The findings also illustrate the complex range of factors which influence how touch is inhibited, including: risk aversion, emotional burn out, bureaucracy and the construction of children in care as ‘moral dirt’ (<b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007).</b> The thesis concludes by producing a typology of touching practices which synthesises the range of meanings behind the uses - and avoidance - of touch in residential child care practice. This typology is also used to re-conceptualise intimacy in professional relationships in a way that accounts for the messy ambiguity of adult-child relationships in the lifespace...|$|E
40|$|Biopharming is an {{agricultural}} technology {{on the cusp}} of commercialisation. The technology uses genetically modified crop plants and animals to produce pharmaceuticals. Biopharm crops are now grown in the United States and Europe, and biopharm animals are being raised in New Zealand and elsewhere. The Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit (AERU) conducted research on the industry in 2006 and 2007 (Kaye-Blake, Saunders, & <b>Ferguson,</b> <b>2007),</b> finding that ‘the necessary information to develop a robust economic analysis of these products is lacking. Much of the information on the relevant dimensions is simply unknown. ’ This report builds on the prior AERU study. First, it presents an update on the biopharming industry and the economics literature on it. Secondly, it presents economic modelling to estimate the potential impacts of biopharming in New Zealand. This analysis uses the Lincoln Trade and Environment Model (LTEM) to simulate different market impacts from biopharming and estimate the net economic impacts. Finally, the ramifications of these estimates for biopharming in New Zealand are discussed. The literature on biopharming has not developed appreciably {{in the last year or}} two. There are still a number of unknowns, and its profitability and potential impacts on the wider agricultural sector depend on the pharmaceutical, crop, and region being studied. Consumer reactions appear to be a significant factor. Consumer perceptions of biopharming and the food system are presented in the literature in essentially three ways. One model of perceptions is ecological: it considers the biopharm organism in an agro-ecological environment. A second model is genetic, and focuses on the potential for modified genes to escape the biopharm crop or animal and enter the genome of other organisms. The third model considers how food is produced and the potential for mixing biopharm material with food crops and ingredients in the food industry. A model of international trade in agricultural commodities – the LTEM – was used to analyse the impact of changes in agricultural markets due to the introduction of biopharming into the dairy sector in New Zealand. The results provided information about the relative sizes of potential economic impacts given different future changes in the markets. Biopharming could have either positive, neutral, or negative impacts on the demand for New Zealand dairy products. In addition, it may be pursued without any impact on the cost structure of the wider dairy sector, but it could impose segregation or similar costs on non-biopharm producers...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Procurement and Construction Council (APCC) (2001) {{noted that}} Australian {{government}} assets, such as buildings, roads, rail and utilities, are valued at around 371 billion and approximately 18 billion is spent annually by state, territory and commonwealth governments on acquiring and maintaining these assets. <b>Ferguson</b> (<b>2007)</b> estimates that over 200 billion {{will be spent}} on engineering assets such as transport (roads and rail), ports, utilities (water and electricity) and broadband {{in the next few}} years in Australia. Such engineering assets are highly complex arrangements which comprise social and technical systems, are capital intensive, and typically last for significant lengths of time (Herder and Verwater-Lukszo 2006). Indeed it is considered that the optimal functioning of engineering assets such as "transportation, energy, information and communication, and water is vital for the economy and society" (Herder and Verwater-Lukszo 2006, 119). Engineering assets are thus significant in both economic and social terms (APCC 2001). Recognising the importance of engineering assets to society, many jurisdictions in Australia have developed policies on the strategic management of engineering assets (e. g. Queensland Treasury 2003, Western Australia Department of Treasury and Finance 2005) particularly in order to guide the procurement of assets, asset management and maintenance, which is now typically achieved through private firms. The APCC (2001) has argued that the effective and efficient management of these assets is in the best interest of government, business and society (APCC 2001). As an emerging field of endeavour, engineering asset management seeks to optimise the performance of these engineering assets – particularly the whole-of-life management of risks and expenditures for the purpose of achieving organisational goals (British Standards 2003). Given the relative newness of the field, much research is still needed in order to identify the optimal ways of procuring engineering asset management and maintenance from the private sector by government (Lædre, Austeng, Haugen and Kaklegg 2006). Procuring engineering asset management and maintenance is a critical arena in which to conduct research due to the size of expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining these assets (APCC 2001), the typical longevity of the assets, and the significant risk posed to society if these assets were to fail (Herder and Verwater-Lukso 2006). This paper argues that a richer understanding of the procurement of engineering asset management and maintenance services can be achieved by using perspectives from complex adaptive systems theory. The following sections outline the administrative challenges faced by governments as they seek to arrange for the management and maintenance of these assets, as these arrangements are of central interest to this research project. Firstly, the complex public policy issues which have arisen due to new systems of government in western democracies will be outlined, together with drawing out the implications of these arrangements for engineering asset management. Theoretical perspectives which have been deployed to explore this complexity will then be surveyed, and the utility of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to investigate the procurement of engineering asset management will be advanced...|$|E
