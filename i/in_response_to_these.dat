40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how both {{success and failure}} induce anxiety, and how {{narratives}} help defend against it. We argue, using a psychoanalytic approach, that these narratives become culturally embedded through sharing and approval, and they become available as resources that are often drawn upon unconsciously when faced with anxiety-provoking experiences. Empirically, we draw upon data about Indian employees in India. The Indian cultural context offers rich insights into the interrelatedness of success and failure, anxiety, and narratives as defences <b>in</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> experiences...|$|R

40|$|This article explores ethnic {{identities in}} {{representations}} of tuna fishing and canning companies in Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. One point {{raised by the}} analysis is that while national identities in these countries are often disrupted by subnational ethnic identities, strong nationalist discourses pervade representations of these companies. The nationalism apparent <b>in</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> companies is negative, reacting against perceived exploitation by foreigners through narratives of corporate wrongdoing. This article investigates {{the significance of this}} style of identification and questions whether the national identities entailed in negative representations of foreign investment constitute resistance against development or a disempowering victim identification that reifies a subordinate position in the world political economy...|$|R

5|$|Although the Germans {{were still}} on the {{offensive}} in late July 1918, the Allied armies were growing in strength, as more American units arrived in France, and British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The German commanders realized in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of Rheims, or in Flanders near Mount Kemmel, while they believed the British would attack along either the Lys or near Albert. The Allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter-offensives in these sectors, both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night, and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent.|$|E

5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides of}} other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany {{maintained}} a relatively normal relationship {{as they were}} united by anti-Polish sentiment. In January 1928, after long and difficult negotiations, Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty, which left Klaipėda on the Lithuanian side. However, tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany. An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> arrests and trials, Germany declared a boycott of Lithuanian agricultural imports. The boycott caused an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), where farmers organized violent protests. However, after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro-Nazi prisoners received amnesty. In {{the wake of the}} amnesties, Lithuanian prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda, allowing Germany to strengthen its influence in the region.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications.

5|$|In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta {{and other}} Africans in London; {{he became the}} honorary {{secretary}} of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C.

This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa {{to the treatment of}} Jews in Nazi Germany. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In January 1905, the {{massacre}} of protesters {{that came to be}} known as Bloody Sunday took place in St. Petersburg, sparking the civil unrest known as the Revolution of 1905. <b>In</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> events, Lenin urged Bolsheviks in the Empire to take a greater role in the unrest, encouraging violent insurrection against the Tsarist establishment, including police and the Black Hundreds. He also insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks, although many Bolsheviks, among them close colleagues like Gusev and Zemlyachka, disagreed with him. Thus, both groups were invited to the 3rd RSDLP Congress, held in London in April 1905; nevertheless, few Mensheviks attended, and Lenin used the Congress to reassert his dominance within the party. He also oversaw the formation of a new Bolshevik newspaper, Proletari (The Worker).|$|E
