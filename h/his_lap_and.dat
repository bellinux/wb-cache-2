5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E

25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E

25|$|Saṅkalpa (Hindi: सङ्कल्प, meaning Resolution): The canto {{begins with}} the concept of {{resolution}} – the poet states that a noble resolution is the true and pure resolution. Aṣṭāvakra is born handicapped, and a son Śvetaketu is born to Uddālaka at the same time. Both uncle and nephew grow up together in Uddālaka's Āśrama. Uddālaka is more fond of Aṣṭāvakra, his disabled grandson, than Śvetaketu. Aṣṭāvakra excels in learning from Uddālaka, outclassing all other disciples including Śvetaketu. On Aṣṭāvakra's tenth birthday, Uddālaka organises a celebration. Uddālaka makes Aṣṭāvakra sit in <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> starts embracing him. Seeing this, Śvetaketu is possessed by jealousy, and asks Aṣṭāvakra to get down from his father's lap. Śvetaketu tells him that Uddālaka is actually his grandfather, and that he does not know about his real father. Śvetaketu further humiliates Aṣṭāvakra by mocking his disability. On hearing about his real father Kahola from Sujātā, Aṣṭāvakra thanks Śvetaketu for awakening him. Aṣṭāvakra makes a firm resolution of not returning to Uddālaka's Āśrama without his father. The resolution will show the world that the disabled can achieve anything they dream of.|$|E
25|$|Adrian Quaife-Hobbs locked his tyres on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> took eighth. Bird {{improved}} late in {{the session}} to secure ninth and Frijns rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Calado was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten as his best time was 1.451 seconds slower than Leimer's pace. However he was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an accident in the previous round {{of the season in}} Sepang. Trummer thus moved into eleventh and Palmer started from twelfth. The next two positions on the grid were filled by Cecotto and Abt. Sergio Canamasas set the sixteenth-fastest time but was sent {{to the back of the}} grid after being adjudged by the race stewards to have deliberately forced Kevin Ceccon off the track while attempting to pass him after qualifying ended. Kevin Giovesi was also penalised after the stewards ruled that he impeded Cecotto between the ninth and tenth turns and dropped three places on the grid. Mitch Evans was the only driver to be affected by problems as his car was affected by electrical problems and consequently pulled off into one of the track's run-off areas. This meant Evans was restricted to starting from sixteenth. The rest of the field lined up as Ceccon, Leal, René Binder, Jake Rosenzweig, Nathanaël Berthon, Pål Varhaug, Rio Haryanto and Daniël de Jong.|$|E
500|$|Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg {{were the}} first out in Q3. Hamilton's early sector times put him on course to a new fastest lap of the weekend, but a brake lockup at turn ten ruined <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> tyres, handing {{provisional}} pole position to Rosberg. As the two Ferrari drivers struggled to find pace, Max Verstappen claimed second place for the time being, before the drivers went out for their second laps. Lewis Hamilton's second flying lap bested Rosberg's time by almost three-tenths of a second, and saw him take the fifty-second pole of his career. The two Red Bull cars of Ricciardo and Verstappen followed, with Räikkönen and Vettel for Ferrari in fifth and sixth respectively, both more than a second behind Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was {{best of the rest}} ahead of Sainz, Pérez and Alonso. It was the first appearance in Q3 for McLaren since they resumed their association with Honda in [...]|$|E

Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the {{telegraph}} office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'...I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open."

500|$|Engel was {{the quickest}} {{driver in the}} fourth group, and {{finished}} ahead of d'Ambrosio and Rosenqvist who struggled for decent pace. Gutiérrez and Adam Carroll were the fourth group's slowest two drivers, and at the group qualifying's conclusion, the lap times set by Abt, Engel, López, Turvey and Vergne were fast enough to enable them progression into the super pole round. Vergne was the first competitor to attempt to record a lap time in super pole; {{he was unable to}} achieve a rhythm and placed fifth. Engel was slower in the track's first sector, but went faster {{in the second part of}} the track by two-tenths of a second to clinch third. López went quicker in the circuit's first two sectors but was unable to go faster in the final sector and was restricted to qualifying fourth. Abt was two-tenths of a second quicker than the previous three drivers in the first sector. Although he lost a small amount of time in the second sector, Abt took provisional pole position with a time of one minute and 2.711 seconds. Turvey lost time while completing <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> qualified in second. The result would have meant Abt securing his first pole position of the season, the second of his career, and his first since the 2015 Long Beach ePrix, but his car's tyre pressures were found to have been below the mandated minimum pressure of [...] Abt was consequently demoted to 18th. Further grid penalties were applied when Engel and his teammate Sarrazin dropped ten places because of them changing their gearboxes. The application of Abt's penalty meant Turvey secured the first pole position of his career.|$|E
500|$|The central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch {{leads to}} the open courtyard, which is two {{concentric}} circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, {{with a number of}} large prayer wheels (nangkhor); this path {{leads to the}} main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king's Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of [...] occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, [...] tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled crown, cover around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his left hand on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future). Incarnations of Sakyamuni are enshrined on either side of a central axis, and the Buddha's warrior guard {{is in the middle of}} the halls on the left side.|$|E
