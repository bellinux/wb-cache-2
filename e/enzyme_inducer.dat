5000|$|Glutethimide is a CYP2D6 <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer.</b> When {{taken with}} codeine,"hits", [...] "cibas and codeine [...] ", it enables {{the body to}} convert higher amounts of the codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine. The general {{sedative}} effect also adds {{to the effect of}} the combination. It produces an intense euphoria similar to IV heroin use. The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a Substitutionmittel that may be a useful alternative to methadone. The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of glutethimide since 1984, a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when less-than-gifted chemists are doing the deed with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control. The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like ethchlorvynol, methyprylon, or the oldest barbiturates is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like methaqualone. Doriden was discontinued in the US by manufacturers in 1993. Analysis of confiscated glutethimide seems to invariably show the drug or the results of attempted synthesis, whereas purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.|$|E

Fruit and {{vegetable}} intake is inversely associated with colon cancer risk, and the flavonoids may have an important role. One mechanism by which flavonoids, including quercetin, may prevent colon cancer is the regulation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 enzymes, which protect the body from foreign substances.

40|$|AbstractIn this {{investigation}} we used statistical methods to select genes with expression profiles that partition classes and subclasses of biological samples. Gene expression data corresponding to liver samples from rats treated for 24 h with an <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer</b> (phenobarbital) or a peroxisome proliferator (clofibrate, gemfibrozil or Wyeth 14, 643) {{were subjected to}} a modified Z-score test to identify gene outliers and a binomial distribution to reduce the probability of detecting genes as differentially expressed by chance. Hierarchical clustering of 238 statistically valid differentially expressed genes partitioned class-specific gene expression signatures into groups that clustered samples exposed to the <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer</b> or to peroxisome proliferators. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear discriminant analysis methods we identified single genes as well as coupled gene expression profiles that separated the phenobarbital from the peroxisome proliferator treated samples and discerned the fibrate (gemfibrozil and clofibrate) subclass of peroxisome proliferators. A comparison of genes ranked by ANOVA with genes assessed as significant by mixed linear models analysis [J. Comput. Biol. 8 (2001) 625] or ranked by information gain revealed good congruence with the top 10 genes from each statistical method in the contrast between phenobarbital and peroxisome proliferators expression profiles. We propose building upon a classification regimen comprised of analysis of replicate data, outlier diagnostics and gene selection procedures to utilize cDNA microarray data to categorize subclasses of samples exposed to pharmacologic agents...|$|E

CLO, PB, and PCN induced histological liver hypertrophy, increases in liver weights, in microsomal protein and cytochrome P 450 contents {{as well as}} increases in specific UGT activities. Despite this, no significant changes in T 4 -UGT and T 3 -UGT activities occurred after treatment by any of these compounds. Furthermore, no significant changes in serum T 4 and T 3 levels were observed and thyroid histology was not affected.

40|$|Sulforaphane is {{a potent}} phase II <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer</b> and {{well-known}} dietary chemopreventive agent. A proteomic study on colon adenocarcinoma Caco- 2 cells was performed to detect differentially-expressed proteins following exposure to sulforaphane. Results showed that sulforaphane down-regulated the expression of serotonin receptors, decreased serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and upregulated nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), promoting signals for serotonin release. The neurotransmitter serotonin induces cellular responses by mediating G-proteins, and activating specific receptors which are important in the proliferation of colon cancer cells. These observed effects of sulforaphane on neurotransmitter receptors in Caco- 2 cells may provide new insights into developing cancer prevention strategies through diet.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To confirm whether 7 days of phenytoin, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer,</b> would {{decrease}} the elimination half-life of single-dose nevirapine and to investigate {{its effect on}} the development of nevirapine resistance in pregnant, HIV-infected women. METHODS: In a pharmacokinetic pilot trial (NCT 01187719), HIV-infected, antiretroviral (ARV) -naive pregnant women >/= 18 years old from Zambia and Tanzania and with CD 4 cell counts > 350 cells/mm(3) were randomized 1 : 1 to a control (zidovudine pre-delivery, single-dose nevirapine/zidovudine/lamivudine at delivery and zidovudine/lamivudine for 7 days post-delivery) or an intervention (control plus 184 mg of phenytoin once daily for 7 days post-delivery) group. Primary endpoints were the pharmacokinetics of and resistance to nevirapine. RESULTS: Thirty-five and 37 women were allocated to the control and intervention groups, with median (IQR) ages of 27 (23 - 31) and 27 (23 - 33) years, respectively. Twenty-three and 23 women had detectable nevirapine levels at delivery and subsequent samples in the control and the intervention groups, respectively. Geometric mean (GM) (95 % CI) plasma levels of nevirapine at delivery were 1. 02 (0. 58 - 1. 78) mg/L and 1. 14 (0. 70 - 1. 86) mg/L in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = 0. 76). One week after delivery, 0 / 23 (0 %) and 15 / 22 (68 %) control and intervention mothers, respectively, had undetectable levels of nevirapine ( 0. 28). CONCLUSIONS: Adding 7 days of an <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer</b> to single-dose nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV significantly reduced subtherapeutic nevirapine levels by shortening the half-life of nevirapine. As prolonged subtherapeutic nevirapine dosage leads to the emergence of resistance, single-dose nevirapine could be used with phenytoin as an alternative if other ARVs were unavailable...|$|E

Aerobic biodegradation of TCE is reported to occur via cometabolism, by which TCE degrading bacteria utilize other compounds such as toluene, phenol, and methane as growth substrate and <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer.</b> Although toluene {{is reported to be}} the most effective inducer, it is regulated as a hazardous material and should not be applied to the environment. The objectives of this study were to identify an alternative <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducer</b> as well as to apply the induced bacteria for degradation of TCE in contaminated soil. We investigated the effect of terpenes, the main components in volatile essential oils of plants, on induction of TCE degradation in Rhodococcus gordoniae P 3, a local Gram (+) bacterium. Selected terpenes including cumene, limonene, carvone and pinene at various concentrations were used in the study. Results from liquid culture showed that 25 mg l- 1 cumeneinduced R. gordoniae P 3 cells resulted in 75 % degradation of 10 ppm TCE within 24 hrs. Soil microcosms were later employed to investigate the ability of cumene to enhance TCE biodegradation in the environment. There were two bioremediation treatments studied, including bioaugmentation, the inoculation of cumeneinduced R. gordoniae P 3, and biostimulation, the addition of cumene to induce soil indigenous microorganisms to degrade TCE. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation were shown to accelerate TCE reduction significantly more than control treatment at the beginning of study.
