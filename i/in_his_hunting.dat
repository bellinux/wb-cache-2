500|$|Bobby next {{appears in}} eighth season episode [...] "Taxi Driver," [...] in which Sam and Dean learn from rogue Reaper Ajay {{that instead of}} going to Heaven when his flask was burned, Bobby was taken to Hell on Crowley's orders. Needing to rescue an {{innocent}} soul and release it into Heaven to complete the second trial to close the Gates of Hell, Sam travels into Hell and finds Bobby who initially believes he is a demon as he is being tormented by demons pretending to be Sam and Dean all the time, but Sam convinces him with personal information only he and Dean know. The two escape into Purgatory, but find the Reaper that Ajay is missing (having been questioned and killed by Crowley). [...] With the help of Dean's vampiric friend Benny, Sam returns to Earth with Bobby's soul, but when Bobby goes to ascend to Heaven, he is trapped by Crowley, who wants to take him back to Hell to punish him for the [...] "damage" [...] he has done to demons <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> career. However, the angel Naomi intervenes, drives Crowley off, and allows Bobby to ascend to his rightful place in Heaven, thus completing the second trial.|$|E

[...] In 1957, about one thousand Bulgarian students a year were studying in Soviet universities, and an additional ten thousand young Bulgarians a year went to the Soviet Union to work.|$|E
2500|$|Alvárez had {{accompanied}} the future king of Spain, Philip II on his tour of his possessions in the Netherlands. After acquiring the Descent from his aunt Mary, Philip transported {{the painting to}} Spain, where it was installed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> lodge, El Pardo. On 15 April 1574, the painting was recorded in the inventory of the monastery palace which Philip had founded, San Lorenzo de El Escorial: [...] "A large panel on which is painted the deposition from the cross, with our Lady and eight other figures ... by the hand of Maestre Rogier, which used {{to belong to the}} queen Mary".|$|E
60|$|The {{night and}} the next day passed quietly. When it grew dark Sid Todd came in, {{followed}} by several of the ranch hands. The look on the foreman's face showed that he had had no success <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Betty Yeti (voiced by Andie Mechanic) is a snowboarding yeti. She debuts in [...] "Snow Place Like Home" [...] {{and returns}} in many episodes, {{including}} the Alphabet Song. She is also called Elizabeth Yeti, and hides one of Wally's birthday clues <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt.</b>|$|R
25|$|In The Swords of Lankhmar it is {{revealed}} that Nehwon {{is just one}} world of many, as Fafhrd and the Mouser meet a German man who is looking for his spaceship, which he use to cross the boundaries between the worlds <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for animals for a zoo.|$|R
2500|$|Jacqueline Left Hand Bull (formerly Delahunt, born in 1943), {{member of}} the [...] Sicangu Lakota of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, {{was brought up in}} her view in a {{traditional}} Lakota way by her grandparents and parents. She became a {{member of the}} Bahá'í Faith in 1981, appointed a Continental Counselor in 1988, and was elected as Chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States in 2007. The family history of the name [...] "Left Hand Bull" [...] involves the elder brother of a family who had done the difficult task of hunting a Buffalo from the left side and was known to provide for more than his family <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting.</b> Years later the younger brother reconnected with the elder and undertook to greatly honor the elder in a ceremony and in return the elder brother traded his name. She shares a short stature with this younger brother who was given the name [...] "Left Hand Bull".|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{black bears}} were hunted by both Native Americans and European settlers. Some Native American tribes, in {{admiration for the}} black bear's intelligence, would {{decorate}} the heads of bears they killed with trinkets, and place them on blankets. Tobacco smoke would be wafted into the disembodied head's nostrils by the hunter that dealt the killing blow, who would compliment the animal for its courage. The Kutchin typically hunted black bears during their hibernation cycle. Unlike the hunting of hibernating grizzlies, which was fraught with danger, black bears took longer to awaken, and hunting them was thus safer and easier. During the European colonisation of eastern North America, thousands of black bears were hunted for their meat, fat and fur. Theodore Roosevelt wrote extensively on black bear hunting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Hunting</b> the Grisly and other sketches, in which he stated, [...] "in [...] chase there is much excitement, and occasionally a slight spice of danger, just enough to render it attractive; so {{it has always been}} eagerly followed." [...] He wrote that black bears were difficult to hunt by stalking, due to their habitat preferences, though were easy to trap. Roosevelt described how, in the southern states, planters regularly hunted black bears on horseback with hounds. General Wade Hampton was known to have been present at 500 successful black bear hunts, two thirds of which he killed personally. He killed thirty or forty black bears with only a knife, which he would use to stab the bears between the shoulder blades while they were distracted by his hounds. Unless well trained, horses were often useless in black bear hunts, as they often bolted when the bears stood their ground. In 1799, 192,000 black bear skins were exported from Quebec. In 1822, 3,000 skins were exported from the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1992, untanned, fleshed and salted black bear hides were sold for an average of $165.|$|E

"I am so {{very pleased}} to be of some use to you, Mr. Yeovil," [...] said the car- owner, with a polite bow, and Yeovil {{recognised}} the young Leutnant von Gabelroth, who had been present at the musical afternoon at Berkshire Street. He had doubtless seen him at the meet that morning, but <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> kit he had escaped his observation.|$|E

Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Barnaby peels away at the wholesome veneer of Ferne Basset <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for a dangerous and sadistic killer.|$|R
60|$|The three cadets {{had listened}} to this talk with intense interest. Now Jack could not {{resist the temptation to}} peer in at one corner of the window. He saw one of the Germans {{returning}} a wallet to his pocket, and saw Tony Duval take up several bank bills from the table and place them away <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> jacket. All of the Germans were on their feet, and now turned to the door, which one of them flung wide open.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! Who's this? Why, Harry!" [...] exclaimed Silas, {{grasping}} {{the boy and}} drawing him into the room. Once in the light Silas saw that the lad was so weak he could hardly stand. He was covered with blood. It dripped from a bandage wound tightly about his arm; it oozed through a hole <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> shirt, and it flowed from a wound over his temple. The shadow of death was already stealing over the pallid face, but from the grey eyes shone an indomitable spirit, a spirit which nothing but death could quench.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{their pride}} and poverty, as I take it, results one {{advantage}} this country enjoys--namely, the gentlemen here {{are much better}} bred than among us. No such character here as our fox-hunters; and they have expressed great surprise when I informed them that some men in Ireland of one thousand pounds a year spend their whole lives in running after a hare, and drinking to be drunk. Truly if such a being, equipped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> dress, came among a circle of Scotch gentry, they would behold him with the same astonishment that a countryman does King George on horseback.|$|E
6000|$|After that Tony Bings {{told his}} story, {{how he had}} come to that {{neighborhood}} and [...] "struck it rich," [...] as he confided to Jack Wumble.

5000|$|Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon - A jurist and {{political}} aspirant {{who lives on}} a comfortable estate out of town. In appearance and character he so strongly resembles Colonel Pyncheon that some people mistake portraits of the ancestor for the descendant.

60|$|Sometimes Edmund made {{excursions}} in the fens, where with {{nets and}} snares {{he caught the}} fish which swarmed in the sluggish waters; or, having covered his boat with a leafy bower until it resembled a floating bush, drifted close to the flocks of wild-fowl, and with his bow and arrows obtained many a plump wild duck. Smaller birds were caught in snares or traps, or with bird-lime smeared on twigs. Eldred seldom joined his son <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> excursions, as he was busied with his brother the abbot in concerting the measures of defence and in organizing a band of messengers, who, on the first warning of danger, could be despatched throughout the fens to call in the fisher population to the defence of the abbey.|$|E
60|$|Of {{all those}} who are forever trying to catch Peter Rabbit, he fears none more than Yowler the Bob-cat. And from that fear has grown hate. You will find it true all through life that hate often springs from great fear. Peter isn't much given to hate, but he does hate Yowler the Bob-cat. It is partly because of his fear of Yowler, {{but it is still}} more because he feels that Yowler is not fair <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting.</b> He has no honor. There are many others whom Peter fears,--Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote, Hooty the Owl,--and with very good reason. But Peter {{considers}} that these hunt him fairly. He knows when and where to be on the watch for them.|$|E
60|$|On our {{way back}} to the hacienda, we met Don Rafael, a younger son of Don Juan Fernandez, a fine young man, about twenty-one years of age, and who, his father {{informed}} me, was at present studying French and mathematics. He was well mounted on a spirited gray horse, and dressed in the Andalusian style, with the little round hat and jacket. He sat his horse gracefully, and managed him well. I was pleased with the frank and easy terms on which Don Juan appeared to live with his children. This I was inclined to think his favorite son, as I understood {{he was the only one}} that partook of the old gentleman's fondness for the chase, and that accompanied him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> excursions.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} see {{the face of the}} silver watch he carried,--an {{heirloom}} from his mother,--but it was too dark, and he had to give it up. Then he attempted to call out, but his voice was so feeble no one standing fifty yards off would have heard it. And Ralph was miles and miles away, hopelessly lost <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> after <b>his</b> missing brother.|$|R
5000|$|... 933 (Jōhei 3, 12th month): Ten of {{the chief}} dignitaries of the empire went falcon-hunting {{together}} in Owari Province. Each of them was magnificent <b>in</b> <b>his</b> formal <b>hunting</b> attire.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} day we reached the hot, low-lying veld which the herd of buffalo was said to inhabit. Next morning, however, when we were making ready to begin hunting, a Basuto Kaffir appeared who, on being questioned, {{said that he was}} one of Sekukuni's people sent to this district to look for two lost oxen. I did not believe this story, thinking it more probable that he was a spy, but asked him whether <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for oxen he had come across buffalo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Snow King is fearless {{and has not}} yet {{learned to}} dread man, as have his cousins. He will not {{hesitate}} to attack man and is terrible to meet at close quarters. Because he lives in that far, cold country, he is not hunted as much as other bears are. Besides the Seals and fish, he sometimes catches an Arctic Hare. In the summer great numbers of Ducks and other sea birds nest in that far northern country, and their eggs and young add to Snow King's bill of fare. His white coat is so {{in keeping with his}} surroundings that it is of the greatest aid to him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting.</b> It is a very beautiful coat and makes him the most beautiful of all the Bear family.|$|E
6000|$|Over against Coblenz, {{nestled in}} between the Rhine and the foot of Ehrenbreitstein, [Pollnitz, Memoirs and Letters, iii. 180.] there, perhaps even now, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Hunting</b> Lodge of Kerlich yonder, is his Serene Highness the fat little Kurfurst of Trier, one of those Austrian Schonborns (Brother to him of Bamberg); upon whom why should we make a call? We are due at Bonn; the {{fortunate}} young Kurfurst of Koln, richest Pluralist in the Church, expects us at his Residence there. Friedrich Wilhelm views the fine Fortress of Ehrenbreitstein:--what would your Majesty think if this were to be yours in a hundred years; this and much else, by way of compound-interest for the Berg-and-Julich and other outstanding debts? Courage, your Majesty!--On the fat little Kurfurst, at Kerlich here, we do not call: probably out hunting; [...] "hunts every day," [...] [Busching, Beitrage, iv. 201.] {{as if it were}} his trade, poor little soul.|$|E
60|$|Fortune showed itself strangely {{favourable}} to {{the plans}} of Nahoon and Nanea. One of the Zulu captain's perplexities was {{as to how}} he should lull the suspicions and evade the vigilance of his own companions, who together with himself had been detailed by the king to assist Hadden <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> and to guard against his escape. As it chanced, however, {{on the day after}} the incident of the visit of Maputa, a messenger arrived from no less a person than the great military Induna, Tvingwayo ka Marolo, who afterwards commanded the Zulu army at Isandhlwana, ordering these men to return to their regiment, the Umcityu Corps, which was to be placed upon full war footing. Accordingly Nahoon sent them, saying that he himself would follow with Black Heart {{in the course of a}} few days, as at present the white man was not sufficiently recovered from his hurts to allow of his travelling fast and far. So the soldiers went, doubting nothing.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930, Rodway {{assisted}} Harold Comber <b>in</b> <b>his</b> plant <b>hunting</b> expedition, {{during which}} 147 Tasmanian species were collected and despatched to the UK. [...] Failing health caused <b>his</b> retirement <b>in</b> 1932.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} 10,000 years, Bloodstone would travel {{all over the}} world, looking for Ulluxy’l Kwan Tae Syn. As a result, by the 20th Century, he had become immensely wealthy, and could speak most of the world's languages. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for Ulluxy’l Kwan Tae Syn, {{he had become a}} mercenary, adventurer, and soldier-of-fortune, {{proficient}} with most of the world's weaponry. Because of Ulluxy’l Kwan Tae Syn's ability to summon monsters from another dimension, which Ulluxy’l did specifically to keep Bloodstone away from him, Bloodstone gained a reputation as a monster hunter.|$|R
50|$|Also {{during the}} series, {{unrelated}} to Mind's activities, a new {{incarnation of the}} Monster Society was formed, consisting of the Four Horsemen of Apokolips, creatures engineered by Intergang's Science Squad (including Sivana). Of particular note is Sobek, a humanoid crocodile not unlike the beings {{who were members of}} the pre-Crisis Monster Society. This Monster Society attacked the Black Marvel Family for not joining the Freedom of Power treaty, and killed Isis and Osiris, only to be destroyed by Black Adam, save for Death, who flees. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for Death, Black Adam destroys the nation of Bialya, before defeating the final Horseman, torturing it for information, and killing it.|$|R
60|$|And strange ideas floated across Owen Fitzgerald's {{brain as}} he sat there alone, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> gear, leaning on the still covered breakfast-table. They floated across his brain {{backwards}} and forwards, and at last remained there, taking almost {{the form of a}} definite purpose. He would make a bargain with Herbert; let each of them keep that which was fairly his own; let Herbert have all the broad lands of Castle Richmond; let him have the title, the seat in parliament, and the county honour; but for him, Owen--let him have Clara Desmond. He desired nothing that was not fairly his own; but as his own he did regard her, and without her {{he did not know how}} to face the future of his life. And in suggesting this arrangement to himself, he did not altogether throw over her feelings; he did take into account her heart, though he did not take into account her worldly prospects. She had loved him--him--Owen; and he would not teach himself to believe that she did not love him still. Her mother had been too powerful for her, and she had weakly yielded; but as to her heart--Owen could not bring himself to believe that that was gone from him.|$|E
60|$|One dark, stormy night, {{when the}} rain beat down in torrents and the swollen river raged almost to its banks, Isaac slipped out of his lodge unobserved and under cover of the pitchy {{darkness}} he got safely between the lines of tepees to the river. He had just the opportunity {{for which he had}} been praying. He plunged into the water and floating down with the swift current he soon got {{out of sight of the}} flickering camp fires. Half a mile below he left the water and ran along the bank until he came to a large tree, a landmark he remembered, when he turned abruptly to the east and struck out through the dense woods. He travelled due east all that night and the next day without resting, and with nothing to eat except a small piece of jerked buffalo meat which he had taken the precaution to hide <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> shirt. He rested part of the second night and next morning pushed on toward the east. He had expected to reach the Ohio that day, but he did not and he noticed that the ground seemed to be gradually rising. He did not come across any swampy lands or saw grass or vegetation characteristic of the lowlands. He stopped and tried to get his bearings. The country was unknown to him, but he believed he knew the general lay of the ridges and the water-courses.|$|E
6000|$|... "In with you,--quick, boys, in!" [...] said Phineas. [...] "If {{you must}} fight, wait till I {{get you a}} piece ahead." [...] And, with the word, both jumped in, and Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the {{horseman}} keeping close beside them. The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew, over the frozen ground; but plainer, and still plainer, came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind. The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw, far in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming up against the red-streaked sky of early dawn. Another hill, and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon, whose white cloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind. Eliza sickened, and strained her child closer to her bosom; the old woman prayed and groaned, and George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair. The pursuers gained on them fast; the carriage made a sudden turn, and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock, that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot, which was, all around it, quite clear and smooth. This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed to promise shelter and concealment. It was a place well known to Phineas, who had been familiar with the spot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> days; and it was to gain this point he had been racing his horses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> lifetime, <b>Hunt</b> earned special notice for the {{accuracy}} and fine detail of his still lifes with birds' nests, {{as with the}} aforementioned Primroses and Birds' Nests - {{so much so that}} he acquired the nickname [...] "Bird's Nest" [...] Hunt.|$|R
50|$|The name Quaqtaq signifies tapeworm. According {{to local}} folklore, this name derives {{from a man}} who once came to the area to hunt beluga and found live parasites <b>in</b> <b>his</b> faeces. <b>His</b> <b>hunting</b> companions began to call the place Quaqtaq.|$|R
50|$|Mazo’s works owe credit {{above all}} to Velázquez, whose style he was long {{compelled}} to emulate in Court portraits. However, Mazo shows <b>in</b> <b>his</b> paintings a personality of his own. His portraits exhibit startling naturalism and marvelous execution. Mazo was particularly skillful in painting small figures, a cardinal element <b>in</b> both <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> scenes and the landscapes he painted as <b>in</b> <b>his</b> most celebrated work View of Saragossa.|$|R
