50|$|BBC Scotland {{started using}} their own {{continuity}} announcers for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977; before this period, announcers only covered opt-outs, {{which resulted in the}} London announcer being heard most of the time. From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover <b>the</b> lunchtime <b>news</b> bulletin at 12:40, just before the network Midday News at 12:45. There was one announcer who was never seen: Robert Logan, who was also a Conservative councillor. Consequently, he never read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries,</b> nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> just before children's programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> instead of <b>the</b> announcers.|$|R

50|$|On October 2 {{the series}} moved to Thursdays, and on January 8 {{the show was}} reduced to 55 minutes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> network to present a five-minute <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> at 9:25 PM. Quiz moved to Mondays on February 2 and was now preceded by a civilian-defense program (later an American Red Cross program), which along with <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> {{required}} <b>the</b> show itself to decrease to 50 minutes. The Red Cross program ended on March 30, allowing Quiz to re-expand to 55 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{show would}} {{open with a}} 10-minute CBC News summary, usually read by Sheldon Turcott in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> studio, and then move to another studio — the same studio, in fact, that was used <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Journal — <b>for</b> <b>the</b> main segment of the program. Following the launch of CBC Newsworld in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> became a {{simulcast}} of that network's hourly news update that was live for each time zone.|$|R
50|$|Since Easter Sunday 1998, {{there have}} been six episodes a week from Sunday to Friday, after <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> at around 19:02.

50|$|From Tuesday 8 January 2008, former BBC Breakfast anchor Dermot Murnaghan {{replaced}} Julie Etchingham as main presenter of the show.

Likewise Emma Crosby took over <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> from Colin Brazier who moved to Afternoon Live to work alongside Kay Burley. However, shortly after taking up the headline post, Crosby moved to Sky's business news department, and then onto GMTV.|$|R

In order to save this problem, we propose a method which collects original news text from on-line information and extracts summary sentences from them automatically. On this basis, we adopt WML(Wireless Markup Language) to build a news website for mobile devices browsing through <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> <b>The</b> system is mainly made up by Automatic News Collection and Auto Text Summarization.

50|$|January 1980 saw <b>the</b> {{early evening}} <b>news</b> {{extended}} to a 25-40 minute slot, returned to 6pm and relaunched as Newstime, incorporating more regional news coverage, alongside a regular Countryside feature and <b>the</b> deaf <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> A separate early evening news at 5:45pm was reintroduced in January 1987.|$|R
50|$|Bliss was {{considered}} one of the best of all news scriptwriters. During his 25 years at CBS radio and television, Bliss wrote and edited <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> <b>for</b> Edward R. Murrow's broadcasts, worked on the investigative TV series CBS Reports with Fred W. Friendly, and was executive assistant to CBS News president Richard S. Salant. In 1963, Bliss became Walter Cronkite's <b>news</b> editor when <b>the</b> CBS Evening News became TV's first half-hour news broadcast. Bliss was <b>news</b> editor on <b>the</b> broadcast that announced the death of President John F. Kennedy; he had been monitoring the wire reports and gave Cronkite <b>the</b> <b>news</b> when he returned from lunch.|$|R
40|$|Wikipedia’s Current Events Portal (WCEP) is {{a special}} part of Wikipedia that focuses on daily <b>summaries</b> of <b>news</b> events. <b>The</b> WikiTimes project {{provides}} structured access to WCEP by extracting and in-dexing all its daily news events. In this paper we study this part of Wikipedia and {{take a closer look}} into its content and the community behind it. First, we provide descriptive analysis of <b>the</b> collected <b>news</b> events. Second, we compare between <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> created by <b>the</b> WCEP crowd and the ones created by professional journalists on the same topics. Finally, we analyze the revision logs of <b>news</b> events over <b>the</b> past 7 years in order to characterize the WCEP crowd and their activities. The results show that WCEP has reached a stable state in terms of the volume of contributions as well as the size of its crowd, which makes it an important source of <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> public and the research community...|$|R

30|$|News are {{specific}} programs {{that can be}} segmented in different news topics. We thank the authors of (Ide et al. 2004) for providing us data in which news topics are derived from textual information (captions) synchronized with <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> In <b>summary,</b> a topic boundary corresponds to a point between sentences where the keyword distribution is distinct between preceding and following windows of sentences.|$|R

30|$|The {{thematic}} {{elements are}} underlined and New information {{is presented in}} boldface in all the examples here. The Syria Times report focuses on ‘Syria’ and its ‘cooperation’ by placing them initially {{at the global level}} of discourse, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> At <b>the</b> local level, the placement of ‘cooperation’ {{at the beginning of the}} clause is intended to convince the readers that Syria’s good intentions and efforts are predicted, or known, information, even though there has been no mention of its cooperation in previous reports. New information, or the information focus, in the headline is conveyed by the Rheme, ‘appreciated’, which positively modifies the Theme, ‘Syria’s cooperation’. Right from the beginning, the readers of this report are encouraged to infer the innocence of Syria and interpret any references made by other news media to its involvement in Hariri’s murder as unfounded allegations. The interplay between the systems of THEME and INFORMATION, thematization and modification helps to project a positive representation of Syria in example 1.|$|R
5000|$|From its debut, The Daily Buzz {{employed}} a personality-driven on-air approach, {{one that was}} looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network breakfast television shows broadcast by ABC (Good Morning America), CBS (The Early Show), and NBC (Today): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries.</b> Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts' employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in lead-outs to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as {{it was meant to}} attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the Orlando Sentinel in 2005, [...] "We always talk about The Daily Buzz as morning radio on television or late-night television in the morning. It's infotainment." ...|$|R

30|$|However, this {{segmentation}} {{implies that}} topics are not consecutively segmented, and gaps may occur between two consecutive topic detections. So topic detections cover on average 72.6 % {{of the shows}} (σ= 0.10), because <b>the</b> beginning (head <b>news</b> <b>summary)</b> and end of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> (weather reports) are ignored by the topic segmentation (Fig. 1 (c)).

The commercial program dropped the newscast in favor of airing special-interest stories on issues important to today's children, and features of children and teenagers helping out special causes, which was already featured following <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> prior to that point. The series is formatted similarly to a newsmagazine and features special-interest, sports and entertainment stories; before certain news segments and before most commercial breaks, the series features specialized short pieces about environmental issues and offbeat stories. Sports segments are also provided during the show also in the form of special-interest pieces, and NBC Sports produces a segment that airs in the months leading up to the Olympics called [...] "Olympic Insight" [...] that began in 2008 prior to the Summer Olympics, featuring interviews and footage of American athletes competing in the Olympics.|$|R
