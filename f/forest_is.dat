5|$|Arachnids are {{important}} to the forest ecology, as both predators and prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative. The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National <b>Forest,</b> <b>is</b> believed to be parthenogenetic, meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E

40|$|Using stem {{analysis}} method, the biomass, growing process and diameter structure of 21 -year shady and sunny slope Pinus tabulaeformis <b>forest</b> <b>were</b> investigated in hilly loess-gully region. Results {{showed that there}} were distinct difference in the indexes, tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and timber volume between shady and sunny slope forest. The biomass, growth status and its diameter structure of shady slope <b>forest</b> <b>were</b> greater than those in sunny slope forest. The fast-growing period of tree was from 9 to 13 years. After 13 years, the annual increment of shady slope <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> {{greater than that of}} the sunny slope forest (the annual increment of shady slope forest reached 0. 26 m. a(- 1), while it was about 0. 1 m. a(- 1) in sunny slope forest in the 21 st year). The DBH growth increment of 2 <b>forests</b> <b>were</b> reduced greatly after 13 years, but the declining degree of shady slope <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> less than the sunny slope forest. The current annual increment of shady slope <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> greater than the sunny slope forest after 17 years. There was little difference in the increment of 2 timber production before 13 years. But the increment of shady <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> greater than the sunny forest after 13 years (in the 21 st year, the annual increment was 0. 0023 m(3) in shady slope, but in sunny slope it was only 0. 0015 m(3)). The summit of DBH distribution curve was both partial to left, while the skewness (SK was 0. 75) of shady <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> lower than that of the sunny <b>forest</b> (SK <b>was</b> 1. 03) and kurtosis (K was 1. 05) of shady <b>forest</b> <b>was</b> higher than that of sunny <b>forest</b> (K <b>was</b> 0. 94).

5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining <b>forest</b> <b>is</b> found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
