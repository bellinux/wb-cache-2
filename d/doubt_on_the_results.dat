5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms.

40|$|This thesis formulates {{mathematical}} modelling techniques to investigate groundwater contamination from a leaky saline pond situated above a freshwater aquifer. This problem has received little attention from researchers, {{but given the}} increasing prevalence of land based aquaculture, {{and the fact that}} saline ponds can be considered a proxy for other types of contaminated ponds, for example, tailings dams, it's a scenario that deserves more consideration. Unfortunately, it's also a problem that (currently) cannot be solved mathematically using analytical techniques. As such, it falls to numerical methods when a solution is required. However, although numerical methods will always give a solution, problems such as truncation error and numerical diffusion often cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>result.</b> Therefore, this thesis will instead explore combined analytical/numerical techniques (or quasi-analytical techniques) as a potential alternative. The major transport processes in groundwater contamination are advection and diffusion. These processes are coupled, with each affecting the evolution of the other through time. However, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problem, often one of these processes can be ignored. This is the initial approach taken in this thesis. Given a leaky contaminated pond, separate quasi-analytical solutions are devised for the individual processes of advection and diffusion. These then form the basis of two additional quasi-analytical techniques, which solve for contaminant transport via combined advection-diffusion. Using the above techniques, mathematical experimentation also revealed general empirical equations which simplify the modelling of contaminant transport beneath leaky contaminated ponds...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{emission}} during X-ray bursts is {{a powerful}} tool to determine neutron star masses and radii, if the Eddington flux and the apparent radius in the cooling tail can be measured accurately, and distances to the sources are known. We propose here an improved method of determining the basic stellar parameters using {{the data from the}} cooling phase of photospheric radius expansion bursts covering a large range of luminosities. Because at that phase the blackbody apparent radius depends only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spectral hardening factor (color-correction), we suggest to fit the theoretical dependences of the color-correction versus flux in Eddington units to the observed variations of the inverse square root of the apparent blackbody radius with the flux. We show that spectral variations observed during a long photospheric radius expansion burst from 4 U 1724 - 307 are entirely consistent with the theoretical expectations for the passively cooling neutron star atmospheres. Our method allows us to determine both the Eddington flux (which is found to be smaller than the touchdown flux by 15 %) and the ratio of the stellar apparent radius to the distance much more reliably. We then find a lower limit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neutron star radius of 14 km for masses below 2. 2 M_sun, independently of the chemical composition. These <b>results</b> suggest that <b>the</b> matter inside neutron stars is characterized by a stiff equation of state. We finally show that the apparent blackbody emitting area in the cooling tails of the short bursts from 4 U 1724 - 307 is two times smaller than that for the long burst and their evolution does not follow the theory. This makes their usage for determination of the neutron star parameters questionable and casts serious <b>doubts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of previous works that used for the analysis similar bursts from other sources.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{reservation}} wage has {{played an important role}} in labour market theory; particularly in models of job search, labour supply and labour market participation. Despite this core theoretical role, there is a scarcity of empirical research which explores the setting of reservation wages at the individual level. In this paper, we focus on the determinants of reservation wages, with a particular focus on health, which has attracted very little attention despite its importance from a policy perspective. We use data for males from 14 waves of the British Household Panel Survey and estimate an endogenous switching model which predicts reservation wages for the unemployed and market wages for the employed. We employ methods to deal with the endogeneity of health, measurement errors in our self reported health variable and selection into economic activity. Our results suggest that health is an important determinant of selection, both into economic activity and into employment (versus unemployment) but that, once these participation effects are accounted for, health is not a significant determinant of either the reservation wage or the market wage. This casts <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of a number of previous studies that have failed to appropriately account for selection in models of male wages. Our results have important policy implications since they suggest that poor health is a major cause of economic inactivity. ...|$|E
40|$|Monetary {{economics}} provides one of {{the important}} tools, that is monetary policy, to deal with the macroeconomic problems of the economy. It is concerned with the supply of money and the demand for money. It is often assumed that the money supply is exogenously determined by the authorities and the demand for real money is determined by the market. The demand for money is of crucial importance in the conduct of monetary policy. It helps to understand macroeconomic activities and to prescribe appropriate policy instruments to deal with macroeconomic problems. The effectiveness of the monetary policy, however, depends on the shape and stability of the estimated demand for money function. Empirical studies of the money demand in Pakistan concentrated on the estimation of aggregate money demand function by using conventional regression analysis. The main criticism against the aggregate models of the money demand is that these models lumped two different sectors of the economy, such as the household sector and the business sector. Further, it is argued that these two sectors have diversified behaviour. Their money demand behaviour is subject to different requirements. Sectoral money demand behaviour is thoroughly investigated in developed counties but a very thin literature on the estimation of money demand function by the business sector in developing countries is available, for example, Unger and Zilberfarb (1980) and Cameron and Qayyum (1994). Econometric methodology of these studies is mainly concerned with the estimation of two types of money demand functions such as long-run static and shortrun partial adjustment mechanism. However, the researchers employing the technique of cointegration in the empirical testing of money demand function have cast serious <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of these studies. ...|$|E

The empirical validations performed thus far would suggest that a core set of validated metrics is close to being identified. However, none of these studies control for the potentially confounding effect of class size. In this paper we demonstrate a strong size confounding effect, and question the results of previous object-oriented metrics validation studies. We first investigated whether there is a confounding effect of class size in validation studies of object-oriented metrics and show that based on previous work {{there is reason to believe}} that such an effect exists. We then describe a detailed empirical methodology for identifying those effects. Finally, we perform a study on a large C++ telecommunications framework to examine if size is really a confounder. This study considered the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics, and a subset of the Lorenz and Kidd metrics. The dependent variable was the incidence of a fault attributable to a field failure (fault-proneness of a class). Our findings indicate that before controlling for size, the results are very similar to previous studies: the metrics that are expected to be validated are indeed associated with fault-proneness. After controlling for size none of the metrics we studied were associated with fault-proneness anymore. This demonstrates a strong size confounding effect, and casts <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of previous object-oriented metrics validation studies.

40|$|In {{empirical}} studies of random walks, continuous trajectories of animals or individuals are usually sampled over {{a finite number}} of points in space and time. It is however unclear how this partial observation affects the measured statistical properties of the walk, and we use here analytical and numerical methods of statistical physics to study the effects of sampling in movements alternating rests and moves of random durations. We evaluate how the statistical properties estimated are affected by the way trajectories are measured and we identify an optimal sampling frequency leading to the best possible measure. We solve analytically the simplest scenario of a constant sampling interval and short-tailed distributions of rest and move durations, which allows us to show that the measured displacement statistics can be significantly different from the original ones and also to determine the optimal sampling time. The corresponding optimal fraction of correctly sampled movements, analytically predicted for this short-tail scenario, is an upper bound for the quality of a trajectory's sampling. Indeed, we show with numerical simulations that this fraction is dramatically reduced in any real-world case where we observe long-tailed distributions of rest duration. We test our results with high resolution GPS human trajectories, where a constant sampling interval allows to recover at best 18 % of the movements, while over-evaluating the average trip length by a factor of 2. If we use a sampling interval extracted from real communication data, we recover only 11 % of moves, a value that cannot be increased above 16 % even with ideal algorithms. These figures call for a more cautious use of data in all quantitative studies of individuals' trajectories, casting in particular serious <b>doubts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of previous studies on human mobility based on mobile phone data.

40|$|The {{concept of}} period length in the {{empirical}} application of cash-in-advance (CIA) models is introduced. CIA models posit that individuals and firms hold cash to purchase goods over a period. However, {{there has been}} no research into how long a period is. Existing empirical studies use quarterly or annual data in simulations or estimations of CIA models. This is inappropriate if individuals or firms conduct financial transactions at intervals which are more frequent than 3 months or 12 months. The period length which is empirically consistent with the theoretical restrictions imposed by a CIA model for 9 two-digit (SIC based) industries is determined to be one to six weeks, depending on the industry examined and money variable used. Unlike other empirical work using CIA models, the introduction of the concept of period length allows this model to display variability in the velocity of money. It is also found that the CIA binds between 1 % to 13 % of the time instead of nearly 100 % as in other papers. The effectiveness of CIA in modeling the effect of money on firms and the demand for money by firms is demonstrated in two applications. Each application incorporates the period length concept described above. In the first application, it is found that money is not an omitted variable in the production function of a firm. This result is based upon the fact that the inclusion of money {{through the use of a}} CIA constraint into a model of production does not significantly affect the estimated partial elasticies of input substitution. This paper is the first empirical work reporting this result, and it casts some <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of several earlier papers which conclude that money does indeed belong as an argument in the production function. In the second application, the Euler equations of a firm subject to a CIA constraint are used to derive the firm' s money demand function. The CIA framework yields parameter restrictions for the money demand function which can be tested econometrically to evaluate the performance of the CIA model of money demand...|$|E
40|$|Muslims {{all over}} the world fast in the holy month of Ramadan. Fasting means {{abstinence}} from drinking any liquids, eating, smoking and taking anything parenterally.   It is intermittent in nature from the start of dawn to end at dusk. Fasting has various physiological effects on different biological parameters of the human body. Previous studies that look at effect of Ramadan fasting on blood pressure have focused mainly on hypertensive patients and patients with already established heart disease. (1, 2) There is very limited data regarding the effect of fasting on the normal population. (3, 4) A few previous studies have advocated a hypotensive role of fasting. (5) In our study published in Journal of Ayub Medical College Abbottabad (JAMC) in 2015, “Effects of Ramadan Fasting on Blood pressure in normotensive males”, we investigated the effect of Ramadan fasting on blood pressure of normotensive men. We conducted a repeated measure observational study in Karachi, Pakistan on 70 individuals who were normotensive, non-smokers between the ages of 18 – 50 years.. Blood pressure, pulse, BMI of each participant was recorded one week before the start of Ramadan and in the first, second and third week of Ramadan. The results of our study show that intermittent fasting has a hypotensive effect in normotensive males as proven in animal models and certain human population. There was an average drop of 8 / 3 mmHg and while the results are significant, their clinical relevance needs to be analysed. Studies on animal models have suggested atrial natriuretic peptide, catecholamines, opiates and body mass index as possible reasons for the decrease in blood pressure due to fasting. (3, 6)  Dewanti et al suggested that the cause of drop in blood pressure was the drop in BMI however in our study we found that a drop in BMI only occurred before Iftar {{towards the end of the}} fast. There was no significant drop in post-Iftar BMI although there was a significant drop in blood pressure post-Iftar. At the same time ANP has been investigated and found to have no relationship with the phenomenon. We observed a drop in both pre and post Iftar period blood pressure readings. From the community health perspective these results cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of screening for hypertension in the month of Ramadan. Our study has some limitations.

40|$|Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) is {{the most}} common form of {{cutaneous}} lupus and causes irreversible facial scarring and disfigurement. Hydroxychloroquine is the oral therapy of choice. The factors influencing clinical response to hydroxychloroquine are unclear. Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) treated with hydroxychloroquine demonstrate a positive correlation between whole-blood hydroxychloroquine levels and clinical response. Variation in response to hydroxychloroquine might, in part, be due to genetic differences in the CYP 450 genes responsible for hepatic metabolism of hydroxychloroquine between individuals, which therein could influence whole-blood hydroxychloroquine levels. The influence of genetic polymorphisms on the therapeutic response to hydroxychloroquine, in comparison with host or disease attributes such as smoking status or disease extent, is unknown. A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 200 patients with DLE treated with hydroxychloroquine. The outcomes of interest were: (i) the clinical response to hydroxychloroquine by 6 months and (ii) the effects of disease attributes, smoking, and CYP 450 polymorphisms on clinical response. Although the majority of patients responded to hydroxychloroquine, a significant proportion (39 %) either failed to respond or was intolerant of the drug. Cigarette smoking and CYP 206 and 2 CB genotypes did not have any Significant influence on response to hydroxychloroquine. Multivariate analysis indicated that disseminated disease and concomitant SLE at baseline were both Significantly associated with lack of response to hydroxychloroquine. These findings suggest that baseline lupus severity and SLE are important predictors of response to hydroxychloroquine. A prospective study is required to further explore the response of DLE to hydroxychloroquine and to investigate the relationships between disease activity and eventual response. A validated scoring instrument was designed to specifically measure activity and damage attributable to DLE and will be essential for quantifying disease and appraising responsiveness to hydroxychloroquine in future prospective studies. Following peer review, pilot work and two reliability studies, the Score of Activity and Damage in DLE (SADDLE) was developed as a measure of disease severity in DLE. Activity is measured using erythema, induration and scaling and damage is represented by scarring and dyspigmentation. SADDLE demonstrates evidence of inter and intra-rater reliability and construct validity. In summary, these inter-related studies not only indicate that 1 in 3 patients with DLE do not respond to hydroxychloroquine by 6 months, but also show that lack of response may be associated with disease extent and concomitant SLE at baseline. Cigarette smoking did not influence response, casting <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of previous small single-site retrospective studies, which did not assess confounding variables such as disease extent and SLE and suggested smoking was associated with poor response to therapy.

40|$|The usual mean field {{decoupling}} procedure {{applied to}} the slave-particle representations {{of the problems with}} strong local interaction produces a resonant band, but violates the Luttinger sum rule for the physical single-electron propagator. The number of occupied resonant states is small and equal to the deviation from the sum rule, shedding <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>results.</b> It is therefore argued and illustrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> example of the Emery model for the high-T c superconductors that, through the consistent application of the mean field procedure to the Hamiltonian and the propagators, the sum rule is restored and the resonant band conserved. In addition to the resonant band, the electron spectrum contains large number of occupied states close to the bare site-energy of the site with strong repulsion. These results are also related here to the other similar decoupling problems, which also lead to the breakdown of the Luttinger sum rule. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg 2003...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first nonparametric test whether German works councils {{go hand in}} hand with higher labor productivity or not. It distinguishes between establishments that are covered by collective bargaining or not. Results from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for first order stochastic dominance tend to indicate that pro-productive effects are found in firms with collective bargaining only. However, the significance level of the test statistic is higher than a usually applied critical level. This somewhat weak evidence casts <b>doubts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> validity of <b>results</b> from recent parametric approaches using a regression framework that point to high positive effects of works councils on productivity.

The advent of stagflation, {{and the work of}} monetarists like Milton Friedman, cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> neo-Keynesian theories. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> would be {{a series of}} new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s. The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis. The new Keynesians helped create a [...] "new neoclassical synthesis" [...] that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory. Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school, neo-Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as Old-Keynesians.|$|R
