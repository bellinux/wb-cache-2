5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand {{cell phones}} in 2005.

The world map was provided by a pre-installed PDF file. In 2006 Japanese mobile companies BREW and SoftBank also started selling the game on their mobile platforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Treasury's {{withdrawal}} of funding, in May 1898 the churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate brokered a compromise with the CPF.

The western section would be purchased immediately using £6,000 of the £7,000 already raised, with an option to purchase the eastern section if the remaining £5,000 could be raised within two years, after which the CPF would go ahead with building plans if the money could not be raised.|$|E

5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

5|$|The {{biography}} of Galawdewos' brother and successor Menas of Ethiopia (r. 1559–1563) is divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> one dedicated {{to his life}} before taking the throne {{and the other to}} his troubled reign fighting against rebels. His chronicle was completed by the biographers of his successor Sarsa Dengel (r. 1563–1597). The latter's chronicle can be considered an epic cycle for its preface describing events in previous eras mixed with biblical allusions. It also describes conflicts against rebel nobility allied with the Ottomans as well as a military campaign against Ethiopian Jews.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> The first group, composed of around eight hundred colonial troops {{and led by}} Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{was to take the}} main road towards Rejaf and engage the rebels openly. The second, under Belgian war hero Baron Dhanis, was a much larger force of over three-thousand men, mostly natives from the Tetela ethnic group, and was to take a treacherous path through the jungle to the north. Both expeditions left for the Lado Enclave in December 1896.|$|E

5|$|The head bears {{two pairs}} of antennae, {{the first of which}} is often biramous (branching <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts)</b> and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often {{flattened}} into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The mouthparts consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of mouthparts) and maxillae. Usually a pair of stalked compound eyes is present, although in some taxa the eyes are unstalked, reduced or lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{system is}} split <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station and lines south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no direct {{connection between the}} two stations, but travel is made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of direct connection could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which would build a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E
