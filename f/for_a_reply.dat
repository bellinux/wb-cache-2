While he waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply,</b> Mullan's men bridged Three-Mile Creek and Five-Mile Creek. On May 30, Steptoe responded {{that he could not}} fulfill Mullan's request. Mullan was forced to disband his road-building crew, retaining only Kolecki, Sohon, and a few men to care for the horses and mules.|$|E
25|$|After {{remaining}} in the marshlands for some time, Sulayman ibn Jami' wrote to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, requesting that he be {{allowed to return to}} the Zanj leader's camp. While waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply,</b> he learned that a government force under Takin al-Bukhari was stationed in the region. After consulting with al-Jubba'i, Sulayman agreed to an attack and set out for Takin's position. While al-Jubba'i began attacking the government army with his galley, Sulayman's infantry and cavalry waited in ambush. Al-Jubba'i then faked a retreat and led Takin's men into the trap; the surprised government troops were unable to resist and were compelled to flee, with the Zanj pursuing them over a distance of three farsakhs.|$|E
25|$|Hiding {{themselves}} {{as best they}} could, with aerials strung up in attics or disguised as washing lines, they tapped out Morse on the key of transmitters, and would often wait hours <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply</b> while alone waiting for a signal in reply saying the messages were received. If they stayed on the air transmitting for more than 20 minutes, their signals {{were likely to be}} picked up by the enemy, and detection vans would trace the source of these suspect signals. When the operator moved location, the bulky transmitter had to be carried, sometimes concealed in a suitcase or in a bundle of firewood. If stopped and searched, the operator would have no cover story to explain the transmitter. In 1943, an operator's life expectancy was six weeks.|$|E

25|$|The person {{detained}} as {{an alleged}} militant {{turned out to}} be Akhmed Chataev (Chatayev), a one-handed ethnic Chechen refugee and Russian citizen who has received refugee status in Austria and who had lived in Pankisi for more than two years. On September 6, Information Center of Kakheti announced that Chatayev, described as Umarov’s personal representative in Europe (according to other sources, Chatayev was rather a former special envoy of the late Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov), who had briefly disappeared after the special operation in Lopota Gorge. Chatayev insisted that he had been brought by two Georgian Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department officials, Sandro Amiridze and Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, as a negotiator to talk with a group of 17 Chechen and Kist militants that intended to travel to Chechnya via Dagestan. According to Chatayev, he was unarmed and was wounded when an unknown shooter suddenly shot him in his left leg as he was waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply</b> from the authorities after relaying by phone the group's refusal to disarm. After that, he hid and barely survived for 10 days without any food nor water before surrendering to the Border Police, but his wound got seriously infected and a part of his foot was later amputated in the Gori Military Hospital, where he spent the next 10 days.|$|E

[...] His lung was not fully healed, causing him pain and leaving him breathless. [...] Furthermore, the War Office were sceptical about Trenchard's claim to be fully fit and were disinclined {{to allow him to}} forgo his remaining nine months of sick leave. [...] Trenchard then took several months of tennis coaching in order to strengthen his remaining lung. [...] Early in the summer of 1901 he entered two tennis competitions, reaching the semi-finals both times and gaining favourable press coverage. [...] He then sent the newspaper clippings to the doctors at the War Office, arguing that this tennis ability proved he was fit for active service. [...] Not waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply,</b> Trenchard boarded a troop ship in May 1901, passing himself off as a volunteer for a second tour of duty.|$|E
500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury. Grant {{received}} the letter from a messenger while playing croquet with Porter at a deluxe Pennsylvania retreat. He finally realized {{what was going on and}} was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme. When pressed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply</b> to Corbin's letter, Grant responded curtly that everything was [...] "all right" [...] and that there was no reply. One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce. Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he read the letter from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order to keep people from getting suspicious. [...] Gould never told Fisk, who kept buying gold in earnest, that Grant was catching onto their predatory scheme.|$|E

The application was strongly supported by Count Firmian, and Leopold, in a coded letter home, said he was quite hopeful. While the Mozarts waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply,</b> Wolfgang composed a series of [...] "Milanese" [...] string quartets (K.155/134a to K.160/159a), and the famous motet Exsultate, jubilate, K.165. Leopold resorted to deception to explain his extended stay in Milan, claiming to be suffering from severe rheumatism that prevented his travelling. His ciphered letters to his wife Anna Maria assure her {{that he is in}} fact well, but urge her to spread the story of his indisposition. He waited through most of January and all of February for the Grand Duke's reply. The negative response arrived on 27February. It is not known whether the Grand Duke was influenced by his mother's opinion of the Mozart family, but his rejection effectively ended Leopold's hope of an Italian appointment for Wolfgang. The Mozarts had no choice now but to return to Salzburg, leaving Milan on 4March and reaching home nine days later. Neither father nor son visited Italy again.|$|E

2500|$|On October 24, Chatayev {{was accused}} of the illegal purchase, {{possession}} and carrying of an explosive device, facing between three and {{five years in prison}} if convicted. The date of a preliminary court hearing in the case was set on October 29.

According to Information Center of Kakheti, witnesses (three border guards who detained Chatayev) were compelled by the Interior Ministry to sign false testimonies in the case and Chatayev really carried no hand grenades. The hearing on the case, scheduled for November 15, was postponed till November 26 due to the absence of the border guard witnesses.

2500|$|After waiting all day Wednesday (29 July) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reply,</b> Bethmann Hollweg [...] {{sent off}} three more telegrams {{urgently}} demanding an [...] "immediate" [...] answer to his ‘pledge plan’ {{and the plan}} for [...] "direct conversations" [...] between Austria and Russia and added in severe disapproval of Austria:"These expressions of the Austrian diplomats must be regarded as indications of more recent wishes and aspirations. I regard {{the attitude of the}} Austrian Government and its unparalleled procedure towards the various Governments with increasing astonishment. In St. Petersburg it declares its territorial disinterestedness; us it leaves wholly in the dark as to its programme; Rome it puts off with empty phrases about the question of compensation; in London, Count Mensdorff (the Austrian ambassador) hands out part of Serbia to Bulgaria and Albania and places himself in contradiction with Vienna's solemn declaration at St. Petersburg. From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement." ...|$|E
