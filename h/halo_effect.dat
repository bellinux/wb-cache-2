5|$|If {{there is}} a <b>halo</b> <b>effect</b> {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The <b>halo</b> <b>effect</b> of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Behavior {{disorders}} are more prevalent among boys than girls, but {{the etiology of}} this difference is unclear. Studies have not tested for sex bias in ratings as a contributing factor to the differential sex prevalence rates. However, there are several studies showing “negative <b>halo</b> <b>effects</b> ” in ratings of boys (i. e., the presence of one type of behavior artificially inflating ratings of another behavior). These findings have only been extended to girls in one recent study. The current study is designed to test for sex difference in (a) ratings {{of boys and girls}} who exhibit the same degree of disruptive behavior and (b) negative <b>halo</b> <b>effects.</b> Method: Two hundred and thirty-nine college students participated. Sex differences in ratings are not found. Nonethe-less, bidirectional negative <b>halo</b> <b>effects</b> are found for boys and girls (i. e., the presence of oppositionality artificially increased ratings of inattention and hyperactivity; the presence of inattention and hyperactivity artificially increased oppositionality).

40|$|Halos are {{generally}} {{used to enhance}} depth perception and display spatial relationships in illustrative visualization. In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to create volumetric halo illustration. At the preprocessing stage, we generate, on graphics hardware, a view-independent halo intensity volume, which contains all of the potential halos around the boundaries of features, based on the opacity volume. During halo rendering, the halo intensity volume is used to extract halos only around the contours of structures for the current viewpoint. The performance of our approach is significantly faster than previous halo illustration methods, which perform both halo generation and rendering during direct volume rendering. We further propose depth-dependent <b>halo</b> <b>effects,</b> including depth color fading and depth width fading. These <b>halo</b> <b>effects</b> adaptively modulate the visual properties of halos to provide more perceptual cues for depth interpretation.

Existing hierarchical techniques that decompose an image into a smooth image and high frequency components based on Gaussian filter and bilateral filter suffer from <b>halo</b> <b>effects,</b> whereas techniques based on weighted least squares extract low contrast features as detail. Other techniques require multiple images and are not tolerant to noise. We use a single image to enhance sharpness based on a hierarchical framework using a modified Laplacian pyramid. In order to ensure robustness, we remove noise by using an extra level in the hierarchical framework. We use an edge-preserving Non-Local Means filter and modify it to remove potential <b>halo</b> <b>effects.</b> However, these effects are only reduced but not removed completely after similar modifications are made to bilateral filter. We compare our results with existing techniques, including commercial packages and show better decomposition and enhancement using our method. Based on validation by human observers, we introduce a new measure to quantify sharpness quality, which allows us to automatically set parameters in order to achieve preferred sharpness enhancement. This causes blurry images to be sharpened more and sufficiently sharp images to not be sharpened. 1...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{commonly}} used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 {{which is based}} on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall <b>halo</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
