The data {{were used to}} evaluate the potential of these compounds to serve as electron acceptors in anaerobic environments. The results indicate that for (chloro) benzenes, benzoates, and phenols, the redox potentials of the couples Ar-X/Ar-H are in the range of 266 - 478 mV. This implies that microorganisms can potentially conserve energy for growth by routing electrons in the form of H 2 from anaerobic environments to <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> compounds as electron acceptors.

40|$|Dehalogenases {{play key}} {{roles in the}} {{detoxification}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatics.</b> Interestingly, only one hydrolytic dehalogenase for <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatics,</b> 4 -chlorobenzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehalogenase, has been reported. Here, we characterize another novel hydrolytic dehalogenase for a <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> compound from the 2, 4, 5, 6 -tetrachloroisophthalonitrile (chlorothalonil) -degrading strain of Pseudomonas sp. CTN- 3, which we have named Chd. Chd catalyzes a hydroxyl substitution at the 4 -chlorine atom of chlorothalonil. The metabolite of the Chd dehalogenation, 4 -hydroxy-trichloroisophthalonitrile, was identified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Chd dehalogenates chlorothalonil under anaerobic and aerobic conditions and {{does not require the}} presence of cofactors such as CoA and ATP. Chd contains a putative conserved domain of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily and shows the highest identity with several metallohydrolases (24 to 29 %). Chd is a monomer (36 kDa), and the isoelectric point (pI) of Chd is estimated to be 4. 13. Chd has a dissociation constant (Km) of 0. 112 mM and an overall catalytic rate (kcat) of 207 s− 1 for chlorothalonil. Chd is completely inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and N-bromosuccinic acid. Site-directed mutagenesis of Chd revealed that histidines 128 and 157, serine 126, aspartates 45, 130 and 184, and tryptophan 241 were essential for the dehalogenase activity. Chd differs from other reported hydrolytic dehalogenases based on the analysis of amino acid sequences and catalytic mechanisms.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{widespread}} occurrence and substantial biological activity, <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) comprise {{one of the}} more important classes of contaminants in the environment. Some chemicals in this class cause adverse biological effects after binding to an intracellular cytosolic protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Toxic responses such as thymic atrophy, weight loss, immunotoxicity, and acute lethality, as well as induction of cytochrome P 4501 A 1, have been correlated with the relative affinity of PCBs, PCDFs, and PCDDs for the AhR. Therefore, an important step in predicting the effects of these chemicals is the estimation of their binding to the receptor. To date, however, the use of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to estimate binding affinity across multiple chemical classes has shown only modest success possibly due, in part, to a focus on minimum energy chemical structures as the active molecules. In this study, we evaluated the use of structural conformations other than those of minimum energy for the purpose of developing a model for AhR binding affinity that encompasses more of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> chemicals known to interact with the receptor.

40|$|Abstract: Wildlife {{and humans}} {{are exposed to}} a complex mixture of {{endocrine}} active chemicals. The activity of a specific chemical in any mixture can be modified through interactions with other components of the mixture. The toxic equivalency factor (TEF) approach for risk assessment was developed for chemicals such as <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatics</b> that induce their effects through ligand-activated receptors. For persistent <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> AhR agonists, this approach has some utility. However, {{the use of the}} TEF approach for endocrine active compounds is confounded by the unique tissue- and response-specific activities of these structurally diverse compounds. The term “selective receptor modulator ” describes the ability of a natural or synthetic receptor ligand to manifest agonist activity in one tissue or for one response and antagonist activity in other tissues or for another response in the same tissue. Thus, it is possible for chemicals in a mixture to behave in an additive manner for one response and an antagonist manner for another response. A mechanisms-based hazard risk assessment of endocrine active chemical mixtures must account for these multiple variables...|$|R

Acneform lesions (chloracne) develop as hair follicles dilate and fill with keratin and sebaceous glands become cystic.

Because of the anionic character of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> at the pH of most soil and sediment environments, {{they are expected to}} move rapidly through the soil profile and to pose a great risk of ground water contamination. We designed batch and column leaching tests to characterize the behaviour of three <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> differing in their chemical structures, picloram (4 -amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid), phthalic acid (2, 2 -benzene-dicarboxylic acid), and salicylic acid (2 -hydroxybenzoic acid), in four European soils with different physicochemical characteristics. Batch experiments revealed that the persistence of the three acids in soil:water suspensions decreased in the order: picloram ≫ phthalic acid > salicylic acid, and their dissipation curves were relatively independent of soil type. Sorption by the soils, their clay-size fractions and model sorbents indicated much greater affinity of soil constituents for salicylic acid than for picloram or phthalic acid, most likely due to the ability of salicylic acid to form bidentate complexes with positively charged soil components. The extent of leaching of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> in hand-packed soil columns decreased in the order: picloram (90 - 96 %) > phthalic acid (25 - 90 %) > salicylic acid (0 - 37 %), which was consistent with the sorption and persistence results of the batch tests. The organic C content, the amount of small-size pores, and the initial concentration of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acid</b> in soil appeared to be important factors influencing the leaching patterns of phthalic acid and salicylic acid in the soils studied, but did not greatly influence the leaching pattern of picloram.
