40|$|Abstract — In the {{research}} work, a polystyrene resin was prepared from commercial grade polystyrene beads using two solvent acetone and {{methyl ethyl ketone}} to solubilize the polystyrene beads. Cation <b>exchange</b> <b>capacities</b> of the sulfonated polystyrene resin were determined by Static Method. A sulfonated polystyrene membrane was made from prepared resins. Sulfuric acid {{was used as a}} sulfonating agent. Sulfonation times were 15 min, 30 min and 60 min. The resin prepared for 30 mins sulfonation reaction time at 100 ± 5 °C in acetone and 90 ± 2 °C in methyl ethyl ketone gave the highest values of cation <b>exchange</b> <b>capacities</b> 2. 95 meq/g and 3. 215 meq/g respectively.

25|$|Laterite soils {{have a high}} clay content, which {{mean they}} have higher Cation <b>Exchange</b> <b>Capacity</b> and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|E

Insoluble dietary fibre often {{influences}} food quality negatively; therefore, how to improve the {{physical and chemical properties}} of insoluble dietary fibre of wheat bran for post processing is a challenge. Insoluble dietary fibre was obtained from wheat bran and micronized using high-pressure homogenization, high-intensity sonication, and a combination of these two methods. The high-pressure homogenization and high-pressure homogenization+high-intensity sonication treatments significantly (p< 0. 05) improved the solubility, swelling, water-holding, oil-holding, and cation <b>exchange</b> <b>capacities.</b> The improvement of the above properties by high-intensity sonication alone was marginal. In most cases, the high-pressure homogenization process was as good as the high-pressure homogenization+high-intensity sonication process in improving the above-mentioned properties; hence, the contribution of high-`intensity sonication in the high-pressure homogenization+high-intensity sonication process was minimal. The best results show that the minimum particle size of wheat bran can reach 9 μm, and the solubility, swelling, water-holding, oil-holding, cation <b>exchange</b> <b>capacities</b> change significantly...|$|R
25|$|On dry, deep, outwash {{deposits}} in northern Ontario, both white spruce and aspen grow slowly (MacLean 1960). But, broadly, white spruce {{is able to}} tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968). Soil fertility holds the key not just to white spruce growth but to {{the distribution of the}} species. At least moderate fertility is needed for good growth, but white spruce occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, red spruce, Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960). Minimum soil-fertility standards recommended for white spruce sufficient to produce 126 to 157nbsp&m3/ha of wood at 40 years are much higher than for pine species commonly planted in the Lake States (Wilde 1966): 3.5% organic matter, 12.0 meq/100 g <b>exchange</b> <b>capacity,</b> 0.12% total N, 44.8nbsp&kg/ha available P, 145.7nbsp&kg/ha available K, 3.00 meq/100 g exchangeable Ca, and 0.70 meq/100 g exchangeable Mg.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of charcoal in terra preta soils {{is characterized by}} poly-condensed aromatic groups, that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature loses that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' <b>exchange</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil. The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and {{on the surface of}} the black carbon particles, there are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.|$|E
