5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed <b>graduation</b> <b>and,</b> as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E

5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at <b>graduation,</b> <b>and</b> opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would lose in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E

5|$|By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed {{well enough}} on the violin to gain a {{position}} with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between <b>graduation</b> <b>and</b> attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After {{less than a year}} at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Maryland {{undertook}} an East Coast shakedown cruise. Shortly thereafter, Maryland {{was made}} flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones. Maryland {{found herself in}} great demand for special occasions.

From 18 August to 25 September, she paid her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil's Centennial Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama Canal Zone, Maryland transited the canal {{in the latter part of}} June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast. She continued to be a flagship until 1923 when the flag was shifted to Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Harvard {{entered the}} season as the two-time {{defending}} Ivy League Champion, but its roster was greatly changed due to <b>graduation</b> <b>and</b> the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal {{that led to the}} withdrawal of two star players.

The win against Boston College, gave Amaker his sixth victory against no defeats over Atlantic Coast Conference foes. Despite the team's turmoil, it prevailed to win the 2012–13 Ivy League men's basketball season regular season championship, earning the team an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where it won the school's first ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament game. The tournament victory over #3 seed New Mexico was also the school's first victory over a top 10 ranked team.|$|E
