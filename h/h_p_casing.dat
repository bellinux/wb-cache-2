This classification {{is based on}} an almost completely sampled and well-resolved molecular phylogeny and on a complete morphological data set. We have attempted to delimit monophyletic genera (complicated by the presence of apparent intergeneric hybridization), which are diagnosable, as well as morphologically and ecogeographically coherent. We recognize 17 genera, including five new genera (Austroderia N. <b>P.</b> Barker & <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder, Capeochloa <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder & N. <b>P.</b> Barker, Chimaerochloa <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder, Geochloa <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder & N. P. Barker, and Tenaxia N. <b>P.</b> Barker & <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder), and two sections newly designated for Pentameris P. Beauv. (section Dracomontanum <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder & Galley and section Pentaschistis (Nees) <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder & Galley). Of the remaining 12 genera, the delimitations of seven are changed: Merxmuellera Conert is much reduced by the segregation of Geochloa, Capeochloa, and Tenaxia; Pentameris is expanded to include Prionanthium Desv. and Pentaschistis (Nees) Spach; Cortaderia Stapf is expanded by the inclusion of Lamprothyrsus Pilg., but reduced by the segregation of its New Zealand species into the new genus Austroderia; a large Rytidosperma Steud. is assembled out of Joycea <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder, Austrodanthonia <b>H.</b> <b>P.</b> Linder, Notodanthonia Zotov, Erythranthera Zotov, Pyrrhanthera Zotov, and Monostachya Merr.; and the species previously assigned to Karroochloa Conert & TÃ¼rpe, Schismus P. Beauv., Urochlaena Nees, and Tribolium Desv. have been reassigned to only two genera. Finally, the Himalayan species of Danthonia DC. are transferred to Tenaxia and the remaining African species of Danthonia to Merxmuellera. The 281 species that we recognize in the subfamily are listed under their new genera, which are arranged in the phylogenetic sequence evident from the molecular phylogeny.

Here we studied in a prospective, multicenter, clinical trial the 16 S rRNA gene amplicon based bacterial microbiome in a total of 30 homogenized and frozen gastric biopsy samples from eight geographic locations. The evaluation of the samples for <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> infection status was done by histopathology and a specific PCR assay. CagA status was determined by a CagA-specific PCR assay. Patients were grouped accordingly as <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> -negative, <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> -positive but CagA-negative and <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> -positive and CagA-positive (n = 10, respectively).

Two temporally distinct spike after-hyperpolarizations (a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> s) were identified in a subpopulation of C-type neurones. The fast a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> after a single spike lasted no longer than 500 ms, while the slow a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> persisted for seconds. Both a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> s. were increased in amplitude in low K+ (0. 56 mM) solutions and decreased in amplitude in high K+ (11. 2 mM) solutions, and both were reversed at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The slow a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> was reduced in low Ca 2 + (0. 22 mM), {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 + antagonists (Ni 2 +, 1 mM; Cd 2 +, 100 microM; or Co 2 +, 1 mM) and was enhanced in tetraethylammonium (5 mM). In approximately half of the cells tested, the fast a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> was reduced in low Ca 2 + and {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 + antagonists. In the remaining cells the fast a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> was insensitive to these procedures. Prostaglandin (PGE 1, 1 - 10 micrograms/ml) reduced the slow a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> in all cells tested.

Methods: Cluster sampling of healthy population aged less than 20 years was performed in Ardebil and Yazd provinces over 2 months. Ten cc blood was drawn from each person and <b>H.</b> <b>P</b> IgG was tested using ELISA (Diagnostic Corp., sensitivity 98 %, specificity 96 %). Results: 711 individuals (358 in Ardebil and 353 in Yazd) were enrolled. 170 individuals (47. 5 %) in Ardebil and 108 individuals (30. 6 %) in Yazd were positive for <b>H.</b> <b>P</b> (P&lt; 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} a general method to derive <b>H</b> <b>p!</b> Lp {{boundedness}} from <b>H</b> <b>p!</b> <b>H</b> <b>p</b> boundedness of linear operators, an idea {{originated in the}} work of Han and Lu in dealing with the multiparameter flag singular integrals ([19]). These linear operators include many singular integral operators in one parameter and multiparameter settings. In this paper, we will illustrate further that this method will enable us to prove the <b>H</b> <b>p!</b> Lp boundedness on product spaces of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss ([5]) where maximal function characterization of Hardy spaces is not available. Moreover, we also provide a particularly easy argument in those settings such as one parameter or multiparameter Hardy spaces <b>H</b> <b>p.</b> Rn / and <b>H</b> <b>p.</b> Rn Rm / where the maximal function characterization exists. The key idea is to prove kf kLp C kf kH p for f 2 Lq <b>H</b> <b>p</b> (1 < q < 1; 0 < p 1).

Design/methodology/approach - The weighted (<b>h,</b> <b>p)</b> -divergence between an empirical distribution and the probability of the estimated model is here investigated for large simple random samples. Findings - The unknown parameters of the model are estimated using minimum (<b>h,</b> <b>p)</b> -divergences estimators with weights as studied in previous works by the authors. Originality/value - Research makes {{an important contribution to}} (<b>h,</b> <b>P)</b> -divergences and their applications in statistical and other areas. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Eradication {{therapy for}} {{children}} with stomach and duodenal pathology has become morÄ specific and update. Object of study: To elaborate new treatment providing the complete eradication of <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> among children with stomach and duodenum diseases caused by <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> infection. Patients: 37 children aged 6 - 14 years with chroniÄ pathology of upper parts of gastrointestinal tract and their families were under observation. Methods: <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> was determined in gastric biopsies by urease test and morphological assessment of the bacteria. <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> antibiotic sensitivity was checked, too. Results: Chronic erosive gastroduodenitis was diagnosed in 17 (47 %) children; antral gastritis in 12 (30 %); and bulb duodenal ulcer in 8 (23 %) cases. Investigation of their family members showed that infection was family-based in 34 (91 %) cases. lnvestigations proved lowsensitivity <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> to Tetracycline, Metronidazol and Furazolidone. The optimal treatment scheme to eradicate <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> is: De-nol + Flemoxin + Clarithromycin twice a day within 7 days. Family approach to the child, obligatory investigation and treatment of all family members led to increased treatment effectiveness. Conclusions: Treatment using combination of De-nol + Flemoxin + Clarithromycin provided 100 % eradication of <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> High prevalence of <b>H.</b> <b>p.</b> infection among {{family members of the}} child with stomach diseases indicates family-based character of this infection and requires simultaneous investigation and treatment of all family members...|$|R

40|$|Endogenous {{mechanisms}} of inhibition in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells were studied with intracellular recordings in the rat hypothalamic slice preparation. Hyperpolarizing after-potentials (duration up to 125 ms) followed single action potentials and after-hyperpolarizations (a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> s) lasting hundreds of milliseconds followed brief evoked spike trains. The amplitude {{and duration of}} the a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> increased after spike trains of longer duration or higher frequency. The a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> appears endogenous, rather than synaptically mediated from recurrent inhibition, because it persisted after pharmacological blockade of axonal conduction or of chemical synaptic transmission. The reversal potential of the a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> was at least 20 mV more negative than that of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. Cl- ionophoresis did not alter the a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> Chelation of intracellular Ca 2 + with EGTA injection eliminated the a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> A Ca 2 +-activated K+ conductance, rather than recurrent synaptic inhibition, apparently causes the a. <b>h.</b> <b>p.</b> and is at least {{partly responsible for the}} inhibition after single spikes in magnocellular neurones. During hormone release, this endogenous mechanism may contribute to the post-burst silent period in putative oxytocinergic cells and to the interburst interval in phasic neurones, which are known to fire repetitive bursts associated with vasopressin release...|$|R
