5|$|Throughout 1995, Rosecroft {{was forced}} to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, {{eliminated}} stake races, and {{reduced the number of}} racing days. They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to Cloverleaf Enterprises, a horseman's organization, in mid-1995 for $11 million. Weisman's Colt Enterprises reported that if the racetrack could not be sold, the company would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> for bankruptcy. Cloverleaf accepted a $10.6 million loan from Bally Entertainment in hopes that a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft.|$|E

By October 2009, Vildanden owed Kontorbygg, the operator of Geiteryggen, NOK1.5 million in airport fees. Kontorbygg stated that if Vildanden did not pay, the airport would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> for bankruptcy. Innovation Norway rejected to give Vildanden a loan for NOK3.5 million in December 2009. Kontorbygg stated that the operation of Geiteryggen had cost the municipality NOK50 million {{in the course of}} the five years Vildanden had been operating from it. In February 2010, the Municipality of Skien announced that it required Vildanden to pay back the NOK3.1 million, plus NOK200,000 in interest, that they borrowed in 2007. The loan was renewed in March, after Vildanden paid NOK385,000. From 16 August, Helitrans took over as the operator, using an ATR 42. From 6 September, the company started with flights to Trondheim. The company ceased operations after its last flight on 14 January 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they were near a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E

25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|Many {{industry}} journalists, {{as well as}} {{executives at}} Ford and Chrysler, believed the Taurus {{was going to be}} a failure. Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker, which were still in development at the time. Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers, as was the case with the Edsel. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986. If the Taurus failed, Ford would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.|$|E
500|$|The Daley {{administration}} has been a proponent of the Joffrey Ballet having a permanent Theatre District home {{in order to establish}} it as a major Chicago institution. [...] However, the cost of building their own building at State and Lake was prohibitive. [...] Supposedly, the city of Chicago held the development of this project hostage until the developer agreed to the Joffrey initiative.

William Daley, a co-chairman of the Joffrey board of trustees, is a former Cabinet member in the Clinton administration and clout-heavy brother of Chicago's former mayor, Richard M. Daley.
