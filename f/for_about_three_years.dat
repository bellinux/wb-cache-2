500|$|Having succeeded his father, {{the chronicle}} reveals that Haraldr Óláfsson was soon ousted from power {{by representatives of}} Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263). After unsuccessfully repulsing these men, Haraldr Óláfsson voyaged to Norway, where he stayed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> and thus [...] {{reconciled}} himself with Hákon, who in turn reinstalled him as king in the Isles. In 1247, the late mid thirteenth-century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar states that Haraldr Óláfsson again journeyed to Norway, where he married Hákon's daughter, Cecilía, {{in the winter of}} 1247/1248. On the newly-weds' return voyage in the autumn of 1248, the chronicle and saga report that their ship foundered off Shetland, with all aboard lost. The kingship was subsequently assumed by Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson, with the chronicle dating his accession to 6 May 1249. The latter's reign was an extremely short one, lasting hardly a month, as the chronicle states that he was slain on 30 May 1249. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's body was then interred at Rushen Abbey, the site of his father's final resting place. Following the killing, the chronicle reports that the kingship was seized by Haraldr Guðrøðarson, a grandson of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson.|$|E
500|$|Although Henry's {{marriage}} to Catherine {{has since been}} described as [...] "unusually good", {{it is known that}} Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. The most significant mistress <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> starting in 1516, was Elizabeth Blount. Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, few for a virile young king. Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses [...] "only to a very limited extent", whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs. Catherine did not protest, and in 1518 fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn. Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy. The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation. In 1533, FitzRoy married Mary Howard, but died childless three years later. At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the Second Succession Act, which could have allowed him to become king.|$|E
