40|$|In {{the case}} of a railway vehicle running on track, {{irregularities}} in track geometry can lead to complex dynamic interaction between the vehicle and track. The resulting dynamic forces accelerate the track deformation process and may lead to a derailment situation. Early detection of undesirable vehicle-track interaction allows for timely intervention before the situation presents a serious derailment risk. Accelerometers mounted on the vehicle body produce signals which may provide enough information to autonomously detect and classify dynamic interactions of this nature. This paper develops an understanding of acceleration signals and introduces an autonomous analysis method suitable for low power embedded applications using a time-frequency signal representation. The method is demonstrated on a field data sample collected from a <b>ballast</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>wagon</b> with three-piece bogies running on low-grade track...|$|R

50|$|At {{approximately}} 0428 on 22 May 2007, {{ballast train}} 3MR2 derailed near Roopena (between Whyalla and Port Augusta). The derailment occurred about 28 track kilometres north of Whyalla. Twenty seven <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> were derailed {{but there were}} no injuries.|$|R
50|$|Wagons {{included}} container flats, open wagons, rail transporters, and <b>ballast</b> <b>hoppers.</b> Grain hoppers, sleeper discharge wagons, container flats, and <b>ballast</b> <b>hoppers</b> {{were also}} leased by the company.|$|R
50|$|The Flyer {{also has}} a small {{collection}} of goods <b>wagons</b> including three <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and an EP class plough van. The majority of the goods stock is used for Way and Works purposes, although there are three flat wagons used around the Kingston locomotive depot for maintenance purposes, primarily to hold locomotive parts.|$|R
50|$|As a result, a {{prototype}} bogie <b>ballast</b> <b>wagon</b> entered service in 1901, classed NN 1. This {{was basically a}} flat wagon with raised sides along the edge, but also a small hopper with its own raised sides {{in the middle of}} the floor; this second hopper had drop-doors for increased capacity. Overall the wagon could take 26 LT of ballast.|$|R
50|$|The VHMY {{class was}} built to replace the then-ageing NN and QN-type <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons.</b> The new wagons were {{pneumatically}} discharged {{in lieu of the}} older system where the ballast doors were controlled by handbrake-style wheels mounted {{on the side of the}} wagons; this older method required track staff to walk alongside the train and control the ballast discharge procedure while in motion.|$|R
5000|$|One {{arrangement}} {{used at the}} Dinorwic Quarry {{was known}} as the [...] "Ballast" [...] method. This involved a two track incline with one track reserved for fully loaded wagons and the second used by partially loaded wagons. The line used by the partially loaded wagons {{was known as the}} [...] "ballast" [...] track and it had a stop placed on it part way down. The distance {{from the top of the}} incline to the stop was the same as the distance that the fully loaded wagons needed to travel. Empty wagons were hauled up the incline, counterbalanced by the descending <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons.</b> These empty wagons were replaced by fully loaded wagons ready to descend. The descending loaded wagons then returned the <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> to the top of the incline. One of the major inclines at Dinorwic had four parallel tracks, two worked by the ballast method and two as conventional gravity balance.|$|R
50|$|One {{enhancement}} of the automatic air brake {{is to have}} a second air hose (the main reservoir or main line) along the train to recharge the air reservoirs on each wagon. This air pressure {{can also be used to}} operate loading and unloading doors on wheat wagons and coal and <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons.</b> On passenger coaches, the main reservoir pipe is also used to supply air to operate doors and air suspension.|$|R
50|$|Conversions {{between the}} classes {{happened}} fairly regularly, as the centre unit of each wagon {{was very similar}} if not identical; the changes were mainly to the roof, if any, the discharge mechanism, and the addition or removal of plates over the ends, shielding the brake equipment. As a result, the latest set of modifications and not counting scrappings gives 57 wagons for quarry traffic, 65 <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons,</b> 33 fertiliser wagons and 35 sand wagons.|$|R
50|$|A large {{selection}} of freight wagons has been purchased, donated or leased. The railway has found use {{for many of}} the railway wagons that it has acquired and displays them on demonstration runs and for photographers' specials. The set includes a full rake of <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and plough van, which have been used during large-scale works such as the Waiuku Extension and major track renewal. Other items include replica workman's hut, refrigerated wagons, cement wagons and bulk oil tanks.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these works on his own doorstep, Dickson tendered unsuccessfully in 1855 for the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway. Under {{the aegis of the}} Shropshire Works, he also operated a rolling stock business at this period and is known to have tendered for the supply of <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and wheels to the South Wales Railway in 1855 and to have supplied carriages to the Llanelly Railway in 1856 and also wagons and brake vans to the Belfast and County Down Railway at much the same time.|$|R

5000|$|Wagon {{manufacturer}} Thrall (USA) reopened {{the plant}} as wagon works in 1997, having obtained about a £200 million order from EWS for 2,500 wagons. First production was the BYA type covered steel coil carriers. The first wagon was formally presented in July 1998. Nearly {{half of the}} order was for 1145 HTA coal hoppers. Other wagon types produced included 300 MBA 'monster box', 260 BYA (covered steel coil), 100+400+300 FAA; FCA and FKA container flat wagons, and 60 BRA steel <b>wagons.</b> Prototype MRA <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> were also manufactured for Railtrack at the site [...]|$|R
5000|$|Heljan's current UK OO gauge {{diesel loco}} range {{consists}} of British Rail Class 14s, 15s, 16s, 17s, 26s, 27s, 28s, 33s, 35s, 47s, 52s, 53 [...] "Falcon", 57s, 58s, D0260 [...] "Lion" [...] and HS4000 [...] "Kestrel". The British Rail Class 86s are currently the only AC Electric outline {{models in the}} range. They have won praise for locomotive models {{in a wide variety}} of liveries. Several different models of the British Railways Waggon und Maschinenbau built Railbuses were released in February 2012. They also produce OO gauge British Rail Dogfish <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and Cargowaggon bogie freight vehicles.|$|R
50|$|From 1910, {{another type}} of <b>ballast</b> <b>wagon</b> was constructed. Known as QN from the start and given numbers 1 through 121, the class {{construction}} continued until 1926. The wagons were initially dual-purpose, with a small hopper embedded in {{the centre of the}} floor, but with raised sides and ends and steel plates across the floor for carriage of rails and other maintenance materials. Rail carrying probably only continued until the 1950s, with the introduction of KR rail-carrying trucks - four-wheel underframes fitted so that rails could be welded together into longer sections and placed across a number of wagons, flexing as the train ran around curves.|$|R
50|$|The CFC {{operated}} the following freight stock.Four wheeled open wagons and closed vans, with {{a capacity of}} 10 tonnes, but restricted to 7 tonnes on the lines laid with the lighter rails. also ten bogie lowside wagons by Decauville. There were some unsprung, dumb buffered <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and some bogie flat wagons. There were two couverts surbaissés, which were low floor bogie wagons for conveying cattle or horses. For mineral traffic four wheeled steel sided dropside open wagons were used. Some had brake-huts. There were also ten bogie opens. Another fifty bogie wagons were ordered by the Mines de Barbery in 1914, {{but it is not}} known if these were delivered.|$|R
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} to {{be completed}} was NR61 which performed its first trial on 18 September 1996 between Midland and Jumpakine. The first Broadmeadow built unit first ran on 23 September 1996. The first units were delivered without National Rail branding or logos, but later units were delivered in full livery. Testing of the units was carried out on the NSW Main Northern line between Werris Creek and Maitland using <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> and 442 class locomotives in dynamic braking mode as dynamic loads. Each locomotive was required to accumulate 10,000 km of trouble free running before acceptance. In February 1998 Broadmeadow delivered the last NR class.|$|R

Other work included producing light railway turnouts. The war also meant Melton Constable becoming a German target. The production often went well into the night, resulting in them being well lit. Vast sums were spent on roof blinds to protect from Zeppelin raids. The water tower {{at the back of}} the site has repair work from damage caused from bombs that hit the area. There would often be raids three nights running as in 1915 East Anglia was hit badly. Damage was done in Sheringham and Great Yarmouth.|$|R
50|$|Railway traffic has sharply {{increased}} {{in recent years}} on the section between Nordhausen and Ilfeld. Since 2004 Nordhausen hybrid-trams have run directly from Ilfeld into the tram network at Nordhausen. Other trains run to Eisfelder Talmühle and continue onto the Selke Valley Railway. Apart from one pair of steam trains, all services are worked by diesel railbuses. The only remaining goods trains on the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways work the line between Nordhausen and Eisfelder Talmühle. These regularly transport standard gauge <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> from the Hartsteinwerken Unterberg on rollbocks to Nordhausen. A number of converted diesel locomotives are available for this, which have couplers and buffers at the right height for handling standard gauge goods wagons.|$|R
5000|$|On July 15 and 22, [...] "Castle" [...] class {{locomotives}} Nos. 5018, [...] "St Mawes" [...] and 5042, [...] "Winchester Castle", {{were engaged}} in a series of tests... After they had propelled a 500-ton load of <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons</b> on to the bridge, the locomotives made several runs over the spans on the western (Lydney) side. The eastern section of the bridge, which includes the opening span over the Gloucester & Berkeley Ship Canal, was tested on the second Sunday. At present, former G.W.R. 2-6-0s are the heaviest locomotives used on the Sunday trains between Bristol and South Wales, which are diverted to this route while the Severn Tunnel is closed for inspection and maintenance repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout 1989, ballast {{was brought}} in and {{deposited}} on the Belgrave and Birstall platform for loading into rail <b>ballast</b> <b>wagons,</b> which then ferried the material along the extension to enable the new track to be correctly packed and aligned {{so that it would}} be fit for passenger traffic. All this allowed the Birstall Extension to be officially opened on Thursday 15 November 1990. GCR locomotive No.506 [...] "Butler Henderson" [...] hauled a train of MLST directors and local civic dignitaries from Loughborough Central to Rothley, where they changed to a specially fitted push-pull train for the return ride to Belgrave and Birstall. Regular passenger services, push-pull operated, soon resumed to a point just short of the old platform.|$|R
