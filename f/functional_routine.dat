40|$|Antithrombin (AT) is {{the most}} {{important}} plasma inhibitor for the activated coagulation factors. Its primary target is thrombin followed by Factor Xa, IXa and VIIa. AT deficiency is associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, major causes of morbidity and death. When reduced activity levels are identified it is important to measure the AT antigen levels to differentiate type I (quantitative) from type II (qualitative) disorders, as type II defects have varying thrombotic risk. No <b>functional</b> <b>routine</b> diagnostic assay, however, can be assumed to detect all forms of deficiency, due to lack of specificity. In our study we first show by a nanoplasmonic assay that the exosomal molar concentration in Type I, Type II and healthy individuals is the same. Exosomal concentration normalization allowed to reveal {{for the first time that}} AT is physiologically present in plasma exosomes and Type II defect-derived vesicles harbour a higher copy number of AT compared to controls. Furthermore Type II deficient exosomal AT shows a unique pattern in 2 D electrophoresis, probably related to differential glycosylation. These findings suggest plasma exosomes could complement routine diagnostic tools to unravel qualitative defects in AT deficient patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria control {{strategies}} are {{designed as a}} solution for either the whole region or the whole country and are assumed to suit every setting. There {{is a need to}} shift from this assumption because transmission may be different from one local setting to another. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the risk of clinical malaria given the village of residence among under-five children in rural north-western Burkina Faso. Methods 867 children (6 – 59 months) were randomly selected from four sites. Interviewers visited the children weekly at home over a one-year period and tested them for fever. Children with fever were tested for malaria parasites. An episode of clinical malaria was defined as fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37. 5 °C) + parasites density ≥ 5, 000 parasites/μl. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of clinical malaria among children at a given site of residence. Results Children accumulated 758 person years (PYs). Overall, 597 episodes of clinical malaria were observed, giving an incidence rate of 0. 79 per PY. The risk of clinical malaria varied amongst the four sites. Taking one village as reference the odds ratio for the other three sites ranged from 0. 66; 95 %CI: 0. 44 – 0. 98 to 1. 49; 95 %CI: 1. 10 – 2. 01. Conclusion Malaria control strategies should be designed to fit the local context. The heterogeneity of transmission should be assessed at the district level to allow cost-effective resource allocation that gives priority to locations with high risk. <b>Functional</b> <b>routine</b> health information systems could provide the necessary data for context specific risk assessment. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is hard {{to imagine}} any <b>functional</b> <b>routine</b> that does not involve some motor activity. Whether playing a game at home with friends, dining in a restaurant, or {{stapling}} newsletters in an office, participation involves numerous motor skills. Although motor skills traditionally have been viewed in relation to the normal motor development of a young child, it is useful to consider the functions that motor skills serve. For example, in the routines we just listed, people use motor skills to travel from one geographic location to another. This may involve walking, climbing the steps of a bus, or driving a car. Once at the home, restaurant, or office, the participants use mobility skills to walk between rooms and between areas within rooms. Then they assume and maintain positions that are functional for the activity. They probably sit to eat, but might sit or stand to staple. The functional positioning for the game depends upon whether they are playing cards, croquet, or Twister. Finally, they participate in the core of the activity, which requires motor skills to visually scan and gaze at materials, to manipulate materials, and to eat. Even performing the simplest of the embedded social and communication skills involves some type of motor kills (e. g., smiling when greeted, pointing to a choice). When we think about the ways we typically perform these functional routines, it seems that participation requires an extensive repertoire of sophisticated motor skills. If we concentrate on the functions that motor skills serve in the activities, however, we can see many more possibilities. We know that the mobility function of walking can b...|$|E
40|$|Human vision {{looks very}} {{different}} at different timescales, and therefore models of human vision at these different timescales also {{are likely to}} be qualitatively different. In particular, at the timescale of a few seconds, human vision can be modeled in terms of two primitive <b>functional</b> <b>routines.</b> A "what" routine determines object identity from a segmented input and a "where" routine determines the retinal location of a desired object.

40|$|PURPOSE Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) is frequently used in cancer patients, often with {{contribution of the}} significant others (SOs), but without consultation of healthcare professionals. This research explored how cancer patients integrate and maintain CAM use in their everyday life, and how SOs are involved in it. METHODS In this qualitative study, male participants were selected from a preceding Australian survey on CAM use in men with cancer (94 % response rate and 86 % consent rate for follow-up interview). Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 26 men and 24 SOs until data saturation was reached. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically, thereby paying close attention to participants’ language in use. RESULTS A major theme associated with high CAM use was “CAM routines and rituals,” as it was identified that men with cancer practiced CAM as (1) <b>functional</b> <b>routines,</b> (2) meaningful rituals, and (3) mental/spiritual routines or/and rituals. Regular CAM use was associated with intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits: CAM routines provided men with certainty and control, and CAM rituals functioned for cancer patients and their SOs as a means to create meaning, thereby working to counter fear and uncertainty consequent upon a diagnosis of cancer. SOs contributed most to men’s uptake and maintenance of dietary-based CAM in ritualistic form resulting in interpersonal bonding and enhanced closeness. CONCLUSIONS CAM routines and rituals constitute key elements in cancer patients’ regular and satisfied CAM use, and they promote familial strengthening. Clinicians and physicians can convey these benefits to patient consultations, further promoting the safe and effective use of CAM. Nadja Klafke, Jaklin A. Eliott, Ian N. Olver, Gary A. Witter...|$|R

We hypothesized that subclinical myocardial abnormalities due to inflammation represent an early manifestation of the disease that persists in convalescence. Background: Myocardial inflammation has been described as a global finding in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. Despite normal systolic function by <b>routine</b> <b>functional</b> measurements, reduced longitudinal strain and strain rate have been detected by echocardiography in the acute phase. Methods and Results: Peak systolic LV myocardial longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain and strain rate were examined in 29 Kawasaki disease convalescent patients (15 males; mean [standard deviation] age: 11 [6. 6] years; median interval from disease onset: 5. 8 [5. 4] years) and 10 healthy volunteers (5 males; mean age: 14 [3. 8] years) with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking. Routine indices of LV systolic function were normal in both groups. Comparisons were made between normal controls and (i) the entire Kawasaki disease group, (ii) Kawasaki disease subgroup divided by coronary artery involvement. Average longitudinal and circumferential strain at all levels was lower in patients compared to normal controls. In subgroup analysis, both Kawasaki disease patients with and without a history of coronary involvement had similar longitudinal and circumferential strain at all levels and lower when compared to controls. There were lower circumferential and longitudinal values in Kawasaki disease patients with persisting coronary artery lesions when compared to those with regressed ones.

40|$|Involvement of the {{cardiovascular}} system {{in patients with}} end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is well recognized and {{may be seen in}} several scenarios in adult liver transplantation (LT) candidates. The hemodynamic effects of ESLD may result in apparent heart disease, or in some instances may mask cardiac disease. Alternatively, cardiac disease can occasionally be the underlying etiology of ESLD. LT imposes significant hemodynamic stresses, with cardiovascular complications accounting for considerable perioperative mortality and morbidity. Pre-operative assessment of the cardiac status of LT candidates is thus critically important for risk stratification and management.

Selection of the 113 healthy children (from the 571 measured) was based on an extensive personal and family history questionnaire and on clinical examination before measurements were performed. With three successive attempts it was possible to achieve at least two repro-ducible measurements in 73 % of the children (repeatability coefficient 95. 3 mL). The main problems were leakage at the corner of the mouth and irregular breath-ing pattern. The mean time to perform a measurement was 113 s.

For instance, spectral information combined with nanoparticle contrast agents enables quantification of tissue perfusion levels, while temporal information details cardiac and respiratory dynamics. Common implementations of spectral and temporal (spectro-temporal) CT discretely sample the time points and energies to be reconstructed, proportionally increasing acquisition time and ionizing radiation dose with data dimensionality. Here, we propose and develop an integrated framework for spectro-temporal CT data acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis which drastically reduces the sampling time and radiation dose associated with spectro-temporal CT imaging.

Several studies have demonstrated wide-spread variation and heterogeneity within cell populations of similar phenotype. While the characterization of these populations will likely set the foundation for our understanding of genomic- and expression-based diversity, it will not be able to link the functional differences of a single cell to its underlying genomic structure and activity. Currently, it is difficult to perturb single cells in a controlled environment, monitor and measure the response due to perturbation, and link these response measurements to downstream genomic and transcriptomic analysis. In order to address this challenge, we developed a platform to integrate and miniaturize many of the experimental steps required to study single-cell function.

As a first step towards defining a possible morphological basis for this physiological heterogeneity, we examined different regions of skins from 3 anurans, Bufo bufo, Rana ridibunda and Xenopus laevis, that are species with widely differing habitats. The mito-chondria-rich cell population of the epidermis was counted and the epidermal thickness was measured.

40|$|Parallel {{programming}} {{models are}} quite challenging and emerging {{topic in the}} parallel computing era. These models allow a developer to port a sequential application on to a platform with more number of processors so that the problem or application can be solved easily. Adapting the applications in this manner using the Parallel programming models is often influenced {{by the type of}} the application, the type of the platform and many others. There are several parallel programming models developed and two main variants of parallel programming models classified are shared and distributed memory based parallel programming models. The recognition of the computing applications that entail immense computing requirements lead to the confrontation of the obstacle regarding the development of the efficient programming models that bridges the gap between the hardware ability to perform the computations and the software ability to support that performance for those applications [25][9]. And so a better programming model is needed that facilitates easy development {{and on the other hand}} porting high performance. To answer this challenge this thesis confines and compares four different shared memory based parallel programming models with respect to the development time of the application under a shared memory based parallel programming model to the performance enacted by that application in the same parallel programming model. The programming models are evaluated in this thesis by considering the data parallel applications and to verify their ability to support data parallelism with respect to the development time of those applications. The data parallel applications are borrowed from the Dense Matrix dwarfs and the dwarfs used are Matrix-Matrix multiplication, Jacobi Iteration and Laplace Heat Distribution. The experimental method consists of the selection of three data parallel bench marks and developed under the four shared memory based parallel programming models considered for the evaluation. Also the performance of those applications under each programming model is noted and at last the results are used to analytically compare the parallel programming models. Results for the study show that by sacrificing the development time a better performance is achieved for the chosen data parallel applications developed in Pthreads. On the other hand sacrificing a little performance data parallel applications are extremely easy to develop in task based parallel programming models. The directive models are moderate from both the perspectives and are rated in between the tasking models and threading models. From this study it is clear that threading model Pthreads model is identified as a dominant programming model by supporting high speedups for two of the three different dwarfs but on the other hand the tasking models are dominant in the development time and reducing the number of errors by supporting high growth in speedup for the applications without any communication and less growth in self-relative speedup for the applications involving communications. The degrade of the performance by the tasking models for the problems based on communications is because task based models are designed and bounded to execute the tasks in parallel without out any interruptions or preemptions during their computations. Introducing the communications violates the purpose and there by resulting in less performance. The directive model OpenMP is moderate in both aspects and stands in between these models. In general the directive models and tasking models offer better speedup than any other models for the task based problems which are based on the divide and conquer strategy. But for the data parallelism the speedup growth however achieved is low (i. e. they are less scalable for data parallel applications) are equally compatible in execution times with threading models. Also the development times are considerably low for data parallel applications this is because of the ease of development supported by those models by introducing less number of <b>functional</b> <b>routines</b> required to parallelize the applications. This thesis is concerned about the comparison of the shared memory based parallel programming models in terms of the speedup. This type of work acts as a hand in guide that the programmers can consider during the development of the applications under the shared memory based parallel programming models. We suggest that this work can be extended in two different ways: one is from the developer‘s perspective and the other is a cross-referential study about the parallel programming models. The former can be done by using a similar study like this by a different programmer and comparing this study with the new study. The latter can be done by including multiple data points in the same programming model or by using a different set of parallel programming models for the study. C/O K.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary {{immunodeficiency}} (PID) {{disorders are}} a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders {{caused by a}} variety of monogenetic immune defects. Thus far, mutations in more than 170 different genes causing PIDs have been described. A clear genotype-phenotype correlation is often not available, which makes a genetic diagnosis in patients with PIDs complex and laborious. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a robust, time-effective, and cost-effective diagnostic method to facilitate a genetic diagnosis in any of 170 known PID-related genes by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: We used both targeted array-based and in-solution enrichment combined with a SOLiD sequencing platform and a bioinformatic pipeline developed in house to analyze genetic changes in the DNA of 41 patients with PIDs with known mutations and 26 patients with undiagnosed PIDs. RESULTS: This novel NGS-based method accurately detected point mutations (sensitivity and specificity > 99 % in covered regions) and exonic deletions (100 % sensitivity and specificity). For the 170 genes of interest, the DNA coverage was greater than 20 × in 90 % to 95 %. Nine PID-related genes proved not eligible for evaluation by using this NGS-based method because of inadequate coverage. The NGS method allowed us to make a genetic diagnosis in 4 of 26 patients who lacked a genetic diagnosis despite <b>routine</b> <b>functional</b> and genetic testing. Three of these patients proved to have an atypical presentation of previously described PIDs. CONCLUSION: This novel NGS tool facilitates accurate simultaneous detection of mutations in 161 of 170 known PID-related genes. In addition, these analyses will generate more insight into genotype-phenotype correlations for the different PID disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The European Federation of the Neurological Societies (EFNS) {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of neuroimaging in the diagnosis and management of dementia are designed to revise and expand previous EFNS recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to provide an overview of the evidence for the use of neuroimaging techniques in non-AD dementias, as well as general recommendations that apply to all types of dementia in clinical practice. Methods: The task force working group reviewed evidence from original research articles, meta-analyses and systematic reviews, published before April 2012. The evidence was classified, and consensus recommendations were given and graded according to the EFNS guidance regulations. Results: Structural imaging, which should be performed at least once in the diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive impairment, serves to exclude other potentially treatable diseases, to recognize vascular lesions and to identify specific findings to help distinguish different forms of neurodegenerative types of dementia. Although typical cases of dementia may not benefit from <b>routine</b> <b>functional</b> imaging, these tools are recommended in those cases where diagnosis remains in doubt after clinical and structural imaging work-up and in particular clinical settings. Amyloid imaging is likely to find clinical utility in several fields, including the stratification of patients with mild cognitive impairment into those with and without underlying AD and the evaluation of atypical AD presentations. Conclusions: A number of recommendations and good practice points are made to improve the diagnosis of AD and other dementias. © 2012 The Author(s). European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic {{malignancy}} {{originating from}} clonal plasma cells. Despite effective therapies, outcomes are highly variable suggesting marked disease heterogeneity. The role of functional imaging for therapeutic management of myeloma, such as {{positron emission tomography}} with 2 -deoxy- 2 -[¹⁸F]fluoro-D-glucose (¹⁸F-FDG-PET), remains to be determined. Although some studies already suggested a prognostic value of ¹⁸F-FDG-PET, more specific tracers addressing hallmarks of myeloma biology, e. g. paraprotein biosynthesis, are needed. This study evaluated the amino acid tracers L-methyl-[¹¹C]-methionine (¹¹C-MET) and [¹⁸F]-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine ((¹⁸F-Fet) for their potential to image myeloma and to characterize tumor heterogeneity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To study the utility of ¹¹C-MET, ¹⁸F-Fet and ¹⁸F-FDG for myeloma imaging, time activity curves were compared in various human myeloma cell lines (INA- 6, MM 1. S, OPM- 2) and correlated to cell-biological characteristics, such as marker gene expression and immunoglobulin levels. Likewise, patient-derived CD 138 ⁺ plasma cells were characterized regarding uptake and biomedical features. RESULTS: Using myeloma cell lines and patient-derived CD 138 ⁺ plasma cells, {{we found that the}} relative uptake of ¹¹C-MET exceeds that of ¹⁸F-FDG 1. 5 - to 5 -fold and that of ¹⁸F-Fet 7 - to 20 -fold. Importantly, ¹¹C-MET uptake significantly differed between cell types associated with worse prognosis (e. g. t(4; 14) in OPM- 2 cells) and indolent ones and correlated with intracellular immunoglobulin light chain and cell surface CD 138 and CXCR 4 levels. Direct comparison of radiotracer uptake in primary samples further validated the superiority of ¹¹C-MET. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that ¹¹C-MET might be a versatile biomarker for myeloma superior to <b>routine</b> <b>functional</b> imaging with ¹⁸F-FDG regarding diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis and discrimination of tumor subtypes...|$|R
40|$|In {{approximately}} 20 % {{of patients}} with ankle fractures, there is an concomitant injury to the syndesmosis which requires stabilisation, usually {{with one or more}} syndesmotic screws. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether removal of the syndesmotic screw is required in order for the patient to obtain optimal functional recovery. A literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles in which the syndesmotic screw was retained. Articles describing both removal and retaining of syndesmotic screws were included. Excluded were biomechanical studies, studies not providing patient related outcome measures, case reports, studies on skeletally immature patients and reviews. No restrictions regarding year of publication and language were applied. A total of 329 studies were identified, of which nine were of interest, and another two articles were added after screening the references. In all, two randomised controlled trials (RCT) and nine case-control series were found. The two RCTs found no difference in <b>functional</b> outcome between <b>routine</b> removal and retaining the syndesmotic screw. All but one of the case-control series found equal or better outcomes when the syndesmotic screw was retained. However, all included studies had substantial methodological flaws. The currently available literature does not support routine elective removal of syndesmotic screws. However, the literature is of insufficient quality to be able to draw definitive conclusions. Secondary procedures incur a provider and institutional cost and expose the patient to the risk of complications. Therefore, in the absence of high quality evidence there appears to be little justification for routine removal of syndesmotic screws. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016; 98 -B: 1497 - 150...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Prosthetic and {{operative}} {{modifications in}} total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{have been proposed}} to maximise post-operative knee flexion as it is essential in <b>routine</b> <b>functional</b> activities. Methods: We performed a double blind randomised controlled trial to compare clinical outcomes of primary cruciate-retaining TKA for osteoarthritis with the femoral component implanted in either 4 ° flexion in the sagittal plane (F) or in a neutral position (C). The primary outcome of knee flexion and secondary outcomes knee extension, quadriceps strength, WOMAC, SF- 12 v 2, timed stand test, stair climb test and satisfaction were assessed at 1. year. Knee flexion and extension were also assessed intra-operatively. Implant flexion was measured from true lateral radiographs. Results: Thirty-nine participants (40 knees) were recruited, 20 knees per group. Three subjects from the control group and two from the flexed group were lost to 1. year follow-up but numbers were sufficient to satisfy the sample size calculation. Significant {{differences were found between}} the groups in knee flexion (F: 113. 6. ±. 8. 8 ° pre-operative, 122. 4. ±. 6. 0 ° intra-operative, 110. 2. ±. 7. 5 ° 1. year, C: 117. 4. ±. 11. 7 °, 117. 4. ±. 7. 6 °, 103. 5. ±. 10. 7 °. p. = 0. 031) and mental component score of the SF 12 -v 2 (F 53. 3. ±. 13. 2, C 61. 1. ±. 7. 3, p. = 0. 009) but there were no significant differences in other outcomes and patients were equally satisfied. Conclusion: Flexing the femoral implant in this cruciate retaining TKA system provided a significant difference in knee flexion compared to a neutral position. The improvement appears to occur predominantly at surgery and was not associated with a clinical or functional benefit at 1. year. (ACTRN 12606000325505).
