5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant <b>financial</b> <b>interests.</b> When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Imaging self-referral is {{increasingly}} {{cited as a}} contributor to diagnostic imaging overuse. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether ownership of MR imaging equipment by ordering physicians influences the frequency of negative cervical spine MR imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 500 consecutive cervical spine MRIs ordered by 2 separate referring-physician groups serving the same geographic community. The first group owned the scanners used and received technical fees for their use, while the second group did not. Final reports were reviewed, and for each group, the percentage of negative study findings and the frequency of abnormalities were calculated. The number of concomitant shoulder MRIs was recorded. RESULTS: Five hundred MRIs meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed (250 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 250 with no <b>financial</b> <b>interest).</b> Three hundred fifty-two had negative findings (190 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 162 with no financial interest); there were 17. 3 % more scans with negative findings in the <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> group (P. 006). Among scans with positive findings, there was no significant difference in the mean number of lesions per scan, controlled for age (1. 90 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 2. 19 with no financial interest; P. 23). Patients in the <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> group were more likely to undergo concomitant shoulder MR imaging (24 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 11 with no financial interest; P. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spineMRIs referred by physicianswith a <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in the imaging equipment usedwere significantlymor...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this policy is to define <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> and explain the {{disclosure}} and review of <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in non-governmental sponsors for principal investigators. Definitions <b>Financial</b> <b>Interest</b> in the sponsor of research means holding {{a position in the}} sponsor (i. e., director, officer, partner, trustee, consultant, employee), having a direct or indirect investment in the sponsor totaling $ 2, 000 or more, and/or receiving income from the sponsor within 12 months prior to the time the award is made. “Income ” means payments received, including but not limited to any salary, consulting income, honoraria payments, travel payments, totaling $ 500 or more. A gift is reportable if its fair market value is $ 50 or more. Indirect Investment or Indirect <b>Financial</b> <b>Interest</b> is when the principal investigator has a spouse, or a registered domestic partner, or dependent children with a <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in the sponsor and/or the principal investigator, his/her spouse, or registered domestic partner, or dependent children own directly, indirectly, or beneficially a 10 percent interest or greater in any business entity or trust which has a <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> i...|$|R

St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by <b>financial</b> <b>interests,</b> as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of {{recommendations}} in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called {{for the establishment of}} a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E

5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of <b>financial</b> <b>interests.</b> Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and <b>financial</b> <b>interests,</b> and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
