The proposed composition consisted of calcium enriched calcium phosphate, kaolin and barium titanate in different ratios. The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> was dry pressed at different pressures and fired at temperatures up to 1350 degC for different soaking times. The physical properties of the fired compacts that were tested are bulk density and porosity. These were determined as function of pressing pressure, firing temperature and soaking time for different compositions. The mechanical properties investigated were the ultimate compressive strength and Young's modulus, which were determined for different compositions and forming pressures. The electrical properties investigated were D. C. characteristics (resistivity) and A. C. characteristics (A. C. resistivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss and loss tangent). The piezoelectric behaviour of the fired compacts was investigated and the piezoelectric coefficient (d) in the axial direction was obtained {{as a function of the}} percent barium titanate added. The development of piezoelectricity when barium titanate is added was interpreted, using XRD, as due to the formation of barium titanate silicate. Compositions determined as having properties comparable to those of natural bone, were tested for in vitro solubility in pure water and saline solution. The results obtained showed that the selected composition (containing 15 % kaolin, 10 % barium titanate, pressed at 35 MPa and fired at 1350 degC for two hours) has properties comparable to those of dry bone and a reasonable in vitro solubility.

40|$|Forging dies {{are exposed}} to high thermal load and {{mechanical}} stresses which lead to wear and fatigue on the tool surface. To fulfil the demand of prolonging the lifetime of such high value parts new material designs are necessary. Laser cladding represents an established process to build up tailored layers on complex shaped surfaces. The present work investigates a new approach {{by the addition of}} nano-sized particles to laser cladded layers. The main idea is to reduce the grain size of the cladded layers by adding nano-sized nuclei. A fine grain structure improves strength as well as ductility and fatigue resistance. Furthermore hard particles are able to increase abrasive wear resistance. In the experimental studies nano-scaled aluminum and yttrium oxides, titanium and tungsten carbides are added in small contents from 0. 1 up to 2. 5 wt. -% to cladded layers of conventional used hot working tool steel X 32 CrMoV 12 - 28. Therefore a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> of nano- and micro-scaled materials is produced by high energy ball milling. The produced cladded layers of almost 100 % density are free from cracks. Depending on the added nano-material and the processing parameters a fine-grained orientation-free microstructure can be produced in contrast to cladded layers without nanoparticles. Superior mechanical properties like a high hardness of more than 800 HV and an increased tensile strength are achieved by adding tungsten carbides nanoparticles without affecting properties like the breaking elongation. In addition to the investigations on the tribological behavior of the layers by the calotte-wear-test the friction coefficient is analyzed by forging-test of a ring specimen.
