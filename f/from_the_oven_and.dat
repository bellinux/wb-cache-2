500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death.

50|$|Until recently, {{the process}} largely relied on both {{trial and error}} and the {{experience}} of the operator to determine when the part should be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> when it was cool enough to be removed from the mold.

50|$|The {{meat and}} fat are then removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> left to cool. When cool, the meat can be {{transferred}} to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept {{in the refrigerator for}} up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.|$|E

50|$|As a spekkoek {{commonly}} {{has more}} than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2.

The tin is then removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary heat-treatable steels did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|E

5000|$|In Argentina, the matambre is {{sometimes}} {{served as a}} steak, {{but this is not}} the typical serving method. The more common method is known as [...] "matambre relleno" [...] (stuffed, or filled matambre). The ingredients for this dish vary from province to province, but most common include whole carrots, hard-boiled eggs, and plenty of black pepper. These ingredients are then rolled up inside of the matambre sheet and sewn or pinned together to keep the rolled matambre from coming unrolled. It is then boiled in milk, or sometimes water, and roasted in the oven. After it is removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> cooled, it is sliced into thin pieces of lunch meat and served in toasted French roll with mayonnaise, and sometimes Argentine chimichurri, as a condiment. In Uruguay, and to a lesser extent in Argentina, matambre is marinated in milk, baked flat in the oven, and covered with the marinade, with the addition of lightly beaten eggs and cheese at the end of the cooking period. It is called [...] "matambre a la leche" [...] (matambre in milk).Another method of serving matambre is [...] "matambre a la pizza" [...] which is prepared in a similar way but instead of being rolled it is topped with pizza ingredients like tomato sauce and mozzarella.|$|E
5000|$|So {{they set}} off to kill Taso, but {{when they came to}} his house, he had gone to the beach to sharpen his teeth, and only his mother was at home.

Thereupon Taso's mother sang a song, telling him that there were two men in the gamal and that they should be food for him and for her; so the cannibal quickly returned from the shore, and as he came, he moved his head from side to side, striking the trees so that they went crashing down. When he reached the gamal he climbed over the door-rail, but the boys immediately threw at him all the hot rocks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> knocked him down, and then with their clubs they beat him until he was dead, after which they killed his mother, and setting fire to the house over them, went away.

40|$|Because of {{the need}} to {{significantly}} extend the lifetimes of weapons, and because of potential implications of environmental O-ring failure on degradation of critical internal weapon components, the authors have been working on improved methods of predicting and verifying O-ring lifetimes. In this report, they highlight the successful testing of a new predictive method for deriving more confident lifetime extrapolations. This method involves ultrasensitive oxygen consumption measurements. The material studied is an EPDM formulation use for the environmental O-ring the W 88. Conventional oven aging (155 C to 111 C) was done on compression molded sheet material; periodically, samples were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> subjected to various measurements, including ultimate tensile elongation, density and modulus profiles. Compression stress relaxation (CSR) measurements were made at 125 C and 111 C on disc shaped samples (12. 7 mm diameter by 6 mm thick) using a Shawbury Wallace Compression Stress Relaxometer MK 2. Oxygen consumption measurements were made versus time, at temperatures ranging from 160 C to 52 C, using chromatographic quantification of the change in oxygen content caused by reaction with the EPDM material in sealed containers...|$|R
