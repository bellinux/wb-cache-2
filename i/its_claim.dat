5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> to much of the land in the Great Lakes region. In July 1778, Clark and about 175men crossed the Ohio River and took control of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and several other villages in British Indiana. The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E
5|$|Controversy exists {{over the}} Falklands' {{discovery}} and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintains <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> to the islands. In April 1982, Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands. British administration was restored {{two months later}} {{at the end of}} the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1158, {{during the reign of}} Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince Raynald of Châtillon to swear fealty to him in {{punishment}} for Raynald's attack on Byzantine Cyprus. The Greek Patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin Patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald's capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine vassal state until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel's death in 1180 hindered the Empire's ability to enforce <b>its</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Falklands {{remained}} uninhabited {{until the}} 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride.

In 1766, France surrendered <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{culminated in}} what has become known as the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a {{condition}} for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital.|$|E
5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials {{had made to}} Native Americans in the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communities’ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E

5|$|Czech {{units were}} held up near Skoczów and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on {{historic}} and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. The area {{was important for}} the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice-Bohumín Railway, {{which was one of}} only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority (69.2%) of the area's population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{months after}} {{the signing of the}} Jay Treaty, the United States and Spain agreed to the Treaty of San Lorenzo, also known as Pinckney's Treaty.

5|$|France did {{not abandon}} its claims to Texas until November 3, 1762, when it ceded {{all of its}} {{territory}} west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, following its defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War. It ceded New France to Britain. In 1803, three years after Spain had returned Louisiana to France, Napoleon sold the territory to the United States. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. The United States insisted that its purchase included all of the territory France had claimed, including all of Texas. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, in which Spain ceded Florida to the United States {{in return for the}} United States' relinquishing <b>its</b> <b>claim</b> on Texas.|$|E

At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands west of the Mississippi.
