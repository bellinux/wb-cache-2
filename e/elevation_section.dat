50|$|Geographically, {{the entire}} region of Ward Valley is a {{transition}} from higher elevation bajadas and mountain ranges of the Mojave Desert, to lower <b>elevation</b> <b>sections</b> of Mojave Desert, and the northwest region of the Sonoran Desert in southeast California, called the Colorado Desert.

50|$|The {{region of}} the valley in {{southeast}} California, is the low <b>elevation</b> <b>section</b> of the Mojave Desert transitioning into the Colorado Desert, the northwest extension (in California) of the Sonoran Desert. The region is notable for valleys containing bajadas, sand dunes, and intermittent, dry, or saline lakes. Chuckwalla Valley contains Ford Lake (Ford Dry Lake) in the east-southeast; Palen Lake (Palen Dry Lake) occurs in the center-northwest, at the south terminus of the smaller, north-south Palen Valley.|$|E
5000|$|The Shivwits Plateau {{is a large}} plateau in {{northwest}} Arizona, and in the northwest of the Grand Canyon region.

The Colorado River goes due-south on the east perimeter of the plateau, goes west, then northwest to its outfall at Lake Mead. The southwest of the plateau borders the Colorado, but a lower <b>elevation</b> <b>section</b> is directly riverside; it is lower elevation hills and small canyons, called Sanup Plateau, and bordering the section of the Colorado called the Lower Granite Gorge. (The Lower Granite Gorge starts on the east side at the start of its due-south excursion around Shivwits Plateau.) ...|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{building}} design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional technical drawings (plans, <b>elevations,</b> <b>sections,</b> etc.). Building information modeling extends this beyond 3D, augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions (width, height and depth) with {{time as the}} fourth dimension (4D) and cost as the fifth (5D). BIM therefore covers more than just geometry. It also covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (for example, manufacturers' details).|$|R
