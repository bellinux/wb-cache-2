25|$|As mentioned, one {{variant of}} SPI uses single {{bidirectional}} data line (slave out/slave in, called SISO) {{instead of two}} unidirectional ones (MOSI and MISO). This variant is restricted to a <b>half</b> <b>duplex</b> mode.

Few SPI master controllers support this mode; although it can often be easily bit-banged in software.|$|E
25|$|The higher speed {{rates are}} {{achieved}} {{by using a}} two-lane low voltage (0.4V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156MB/s. In full duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In <b>half</b> <b>duplex</b> mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI).|$|E

The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late 1980s. Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.|$|E

40|$|In a full {{duplexing}} (FD) wireless cellular network, a {{base station}} operates in FD mode, while the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users operate in <b>half</b> <b>duplexing</b> (HD) mode. Thus, the downlink and uplink transmissions occur simultaneously so that interuser interference from a UL to a DL user occurs. In an FD network, the main challenge {{to minimize the}} interuser interference is user pairing, which determines a pair of DL and UL users who use the same radio resource simultaneously. We formulate a nonconvex optimization problem for user pairing to maximize the cell throughput. Then, we propose a heuristic user pairing algorithm with low complexity. This algorithm is designed such that the DL user having a better signal quality has higher priority to choose its paired UL user for throughput maximization. Thereafter, we conduct theoretical performance analysis of the FD cellular system based on stochastic geometry and analyze {{the impact of the}} user paring algorithm on the performance of the FD cellular system. Results show that the FD system that uses the proposed user pairing algorithm effectively reduces the interuser interference and approaches optimal performance. It also considerably outperforms the FD system using a random user pairing and almost doubles the conventional HD system in terms of cell throughput...|$|R

Moreover, each node is equipped with omnidirectional antennas allowing the transmission over distance R.

We model the network with a graph where the vertices represent the nodes and two nodes are connected if they are in the transmission/interference range of each other. Due to interferences a collision happens at a node if two or more of its neighbors try to transmit at the same time. Furthermore we suppose that an intermediate node should forward a message as soon as it receives it.
