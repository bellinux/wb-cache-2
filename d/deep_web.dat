5|$|Recorded over {{a period}} of several years in various studios—including James' own studio in rural Scotland—Syro {{features}} 12tracks and incorporates several subgenres of electronic music including techno, glitch, jungle and ambient. The album also features edited vocal tracks provided by James and his family. Syros cryptic promotional campaign included an announcement made available only on the <b>Deep</b> <b>Web,</b> as well as several press releases in broken English and events in various international cities. Upon its release Syro received widespread acclaim from music critics and placed in several international charts, as well as earning a nomination for the Choice Music Prize and winning the 2015Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. It was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.|$|E

500|$|American band Death Grips has {{released}} six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos. The band {{was formed by}} MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy [...] "Flatlander" [...] Morin in Sacramento {{during the winter of}} 2010. In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP. The mixtape Exmilitary followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics. Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album The Money Store was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the Billboard 200 chart. Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album No Love <b>Deep</b> <b>Web</b> before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012. As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records.

50|$|In {{the year}} 2001, Michael K. Bergman said how searching on the Internet can be {{compared}} to dragging a net {{across the surface of the}} ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed. Most of the web's information is buried far down on sites, and standard search engines do not find it. Traditional search engines cannot see or retrieve content in the <b>deep</b> <b>web.</b> The portion of the web that is indexed by standard search engines is known as the surface web. , the <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> was several orders of magnitude larger than the surface web. An analogy of an iceberg used by Denis Shestakov represents the division between surface web and <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> respectively:It is impossible to measure, and harsh to put estimates on the size of the <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> because the majority of the information is hidden or locked inside databases. Early estimates suggested that the <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> is 400 to 550 times larger than the surface web. However, since more information and sites are always being added, it can be assumed that the <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> is growing exponentially at a rate that cannot be quantified.Estimates based on extrapolations from a study done at University of California, Berkeley in 2001 speculate that the <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> consists of about 7.5 petabytes. More accurate estimates are available for the number of resources in the deep web: research of He et al. detected around 300,000 <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> sites in the entire web in 2004, and, according to Shestakov, around 14,000 <b>deep</b> <b>web</b> sites existed in the Russian part of the Web in 2006.|$|E

While still at CERN, Olive had begun to study the magnetic monopoles which 't Hooft and Polyakov had shown existed in non-abelian gauge theories, publishing a paper with Peter Goddard and Jean Nuyts. In 1977, together with Claus Montonen, he made the remarkable conjecture that there should exist an electromagnetic dual theory in which the roles of monopoles and gauge bosons are interchanged. In subsequent work with Ed Witten, Olive showed that this duality is realised in a certain class of supersymmetric theories.

Bralca seznanja s številnimi pojmi in tehnologijami, ki so nujno potrebne za razumevanje in delovanje Deep in Dark weba, ob tem pa na praktičnih primerih prikaže delovanje sistemov, programov in dejanj storilcev kaznivih dejanj.

The distinction between <b>Deep</b> and Dark <b>web</b> is of utmost importance, because replacing of confusion of concepts not only causes problems in distinguishing the two but also has far reaching consequences in criminal prosecution and regulation. The main aim of this thesis is the exposure and presentation of the new forms of criminal acts, both those we already know and perceive {{as well as those}} that only gained momentum with their help. It acquaint the reader with multiple concepts and technologies that are indispensable in understanding of <b>Deep</b> and Dark <b>web</b> and their operations, while practical examples demonstrate the workings of systems, programs and actions that offenders use to carry out each day. Countries around the world are confronted with this issue more and more, therefore a increasingly more vocal tendency for definition and regulation is present, hence a common solution must be found, one that would satisfy both law enforcement and users who wish to retain their anonymity...|$|R
