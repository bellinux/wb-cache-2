40|$|A {{question}} how effective European Union Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds are in promoting {{economic growth and}} speeding up the process of convergence has attracted an interest of international community and a broad circle of scientists. While some authors claim that only for countries with the “right“ institutions these funds bring benefit, some research on international aid shows that financial assistance is likely to reduce quality of institutions in the recipient countries. This thesis is exploring how the absorption of <b>EU</b> <b>Funds</b> support {{and the quality of}} institutions in EU Member States affect each other by first measuring how great is the impact of public institutions quality on the <b>EU</b> <b>Funds</b> absorption (namely, the <b>EU</b> <b>Funds</b> actually received compared to the amount allocated) in a cross-country perspective, and then conducting informant interviews to find out possible effects of the <b>EU</b> <b>funding</b> (absorbed via <b>EU</b> co-financed projects) on institutional quality in the Member States.

40|$|The {{original}} contribution {{of this article}} resides in the studies {{carried out by the}} Author indicating that a 1 % increase in the profit on sales, against the unaltered remaining financing funds, is connected with a 0. 76 % increase in the <b>EU</b> <b>fund</b> for support of market and capital. Against the EU operational fund, the profit on sales proves negative (- 0. 631). Viewed {{in the context of the}} literature indicating certain difficulties in the determination of the financial security category, the impact of technologies and procedures, the impact of unique resources, the increase of entrepreneurial orientation, and access to EU funding, the present research fills the gap in terms of the determination of the regressive relation between the profit on sales on the one hand, and the <b>EU</b> <b>fund</b> for the support of the market and capital and the EU operational fund on the other. The regressive relation is expressed by flexibility coefficients (parameters) of the power function (model). They contribute to the economic literature with their empirical model based on the Cobb-Douglas power function, whilst the model contributes to the theory related to the financial security of enterprises (model = theory). The principal research tool used in the present study is the Cobb-Douglas power model used to examine the regressive dependency of profit on sales upon the EU operational fund and the <b>EU</b> <b>fund</b> for support of the market and capital as for the years 2014 – 2020. The model has also been used to calculate the marginal and average profitability for the aforesaid funds as measures of the efficiency of their financial security with small- and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. Moreover, the market/capital support fund remains within the sound management zone of the enterprises under research. Originalni doprinos ovog rada sastoji se u rezultatima istraživanja koji pokazuju da je 1 % porasta profita u prodaji, uz neizmijenjene ostale izvore financiranja, povezan s 0, 76 % povećanja europskih fondova za potporu tržišta i kapitala.

The present results confirmed some dependence of perceived initiation toughness values on ENF specimen geometry predicted in recent numerical studies.
