50|$|Primary {{heavy duty}} <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> of 265 to 1000 lbs per disc are mainly used {{to break up}} virgin land, to chop material/residue, and to {{incorporate}} it into the top soil. Lighter secondary <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> help completely incorporate residue left by a primary disc harrow, eliminate clumps, and loosen the remaining packed soil. The notched disc blades chop up stover left from a previous crops, such as cornstalks. <b>Disc</b> <b>harrows</b> incorporate remaining residue into the top soil, promoting the rapid decay of the dead plant material. Applying fertilizer onto residue {{on the surface of}} the soil results in much of the applied nitrogen being tied up by residual plant material; therefore it is not available to germinating seeds. <b>Disc</b> <b>harrows</b> are also generally used prior to plowing in order to make the land easier to manage and work after plowing. Applying a disc harrow before plowing can also reduce clogging and allow more complete turning of the soil during plowing.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{invention}} of the modern tractor, <b>disc</b> <b>harrows</b> typically consisted of two sections, which were horse-drawn and had no hydraulic power. These harrows were often adjustable so that the discs could be changed from their offset position.

40|$|Oxisols such {{as those}} of the Colombian Eastern Plains (Llanos) are {{susceptible}} to physical, chemical and biological degradation once brought into cultivation, especially under intensive use of machinery. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of intensive disc harrowing (2, 4 or 8 <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> passes per year over 3 years) on soil physical and chemical properties, soil phosphorus dynamics, plant growth and nutrient acquisition of contrasting agropastoral systems on an Oxisol. The three main systems tested after 2 years of upland rice cultivation were grass-alone pasture (Brachiaria dictyoneura), green manure (Crotalaria juncea), and maize (Zea mays). Native savanna treatment was used as a control. Intensive disc harrowing improved macroporosity values of 0 – 5 cm soil layer up to 59 % for grass-alone pasture system compared to native savanna. Disc harrowing significantly reduced bulk densities for pasture and green manure systems compared to the native savanna in the 0 – 5 cm soil layer. Intensive disc harrowing significantly improved volumetric moisture content of green manure and maize systems at 5 – 10 cm soil depth. The distribution of biologically, moderately and sparingly available P, organic P and total P varied under green manure, maize and grass-alone pasture systems. Two passes of <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> per year were sufficient for grass-alone pasture, while maize showed greater aboveground production and nutrient acquisition at 8 passes of <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> per year.

50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: <b>disc</b> <b>harrows,</b> tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|E
50|$|A drag harrow, {{a type of}} spring-tooth harrow, is {{a largely}} {{outdated}} type of soil cultivation implement {{that is used to}} smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been plowed and packed. It uses many flexible iron teeth usually arranged into three rows. It has no hydraulic functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effects of tillage practices (with different depths) on soil penetration resistance, technical parameters and grain yield of wheat crop. The experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with three replications for two years. Treatments included: moldboard plow fallowed by two passes of <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> and leveler (CT), two passes of <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> plus leveler (RT), subsoiler fallowed by two passes of <b>disc</b> <b>harrow</b> and leveler (S 1 D) and subsoiler fallowed by rotivator (S 1 R). The results showed that soil compaction and penetration resistance increased {{at the end of}} growth stages because of irrigation operations and cohesion force of soil particles. However due to increasing of cumulative infiltration, it can be concluded that subsoiler caused the formation of micro cracks in different depths of soil. From technical indices viewpoint comparing to CT treatment, S 1 D and S 1 R treatments saved fuel consumption up to 2. 2 and 10. 44 lit ha 1 and tillage operation time up to 0. 58 and 1. 54 h ha- 1, respectively. The result of grain yield assessment showed an increase of 8. 5 % in grain yield after replacing moldboard plow with annual subsoiling.
