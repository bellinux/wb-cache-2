25|$|William Armstrong {{invented a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> that was {{installed}} in dockyards {{up and down the}} country. He then began to design light, accurate field guns for the British army. These were a vast improvement on the existing guns that were then in use.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{the latest}} {{production}} Fahd-240, it shares the position and entry doors for the commander and the driver with the APC variant. A 2.5 ton turnable-mounted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> is mounted on the roof rear, with a telescopic jib that has 315 degrees of traverse, with the boom being elevated to +70 degrees. The vehicle contains two hydraulic stabilizers for the crane, {{in which they are}} lowered to the ground while the crane is being used to provide a more stable platform. The vehicle is 13 tons in weight, and 2.8 meters in height.|$|E
25|$|In 1845 {{a scheme}} {{was set in}} motion to provide piped water from distant {{reservoirs}} to the households of Newcastle. Armstrong {{was involved in this}} scheme and he proposed to Newcastle Corporation that the excess water pressure in the lower part of town could be used to power a quayside crane specially adapted by himself. He claimed that his <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> could unload ships faster and more cheaply than conventional cranes. The Corporation agreed to his suggestion, and the experiment proved so successful that three more hydraulic cranes were installed on the Quayside.|$|E

25|$|The Span and Boat Shed {{were built}} at {{approximately}} the same time using similar techniques (interlocking steel archways on a concrete base), and are located {{at either end of}} site. The Span is a storage facility for vehicles, equipment and waste. It is called the Span as it was manufactured by the Miracle-Span company which specialises in these buildings. The Boat Shed is used to store, maintain and operate the boats for travel to the local islands and diving (all Ribs of various size). It is situated next to the Biscoe Wharf (named after the RRS John Biscoe). There is a slip (only usable in summer) and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> to lift the boats {{in and out of the}} water.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was a very}} keen angler, {{and while}} fishing on the River Dee at Dentdale in the Pennines, he saw a {{waterwheel}} in action, supplying power to a marble quarry. It struck Armstrong {{that much of the}} available power was being wasted. When he returned to Newcastle, he designed a rotary engine powered by water, and this was built in the High Bridge works of his friend Henry Watson. Unfortunately, little interest was shown in the engine. Armstrong subsequently developed a piston engine instead of a rotary one and decided that it might be suitable for driving a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane.</b> In 1846 his work as an amateur scientist was recognized when he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
500|$|The new {{main office}} in Leonard Street opened around 1896 and {{comprised}} [...] over four storeys, complete with internal hydraulic lifts, an external <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> and electric lighting; the company claimed in its press release {{that it had}} more than doubled its sales compared to any previous year {{and that it had}} sales lists for in excess of 100 US machinery manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{series of}} nine late-19th century 160-ton {{capacity}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cranes</b> for naval use. These were erected worldwide, in India (Bombay), Italy (La Spezia, Pozzuoli, Taranto and Venice), Liverpool, Malta {{and two more}} in Japan. The sole surviving example is undergoing partial restoration at Venice's Arsenale.|$|R

5000|$|The {{method of}} loading coal for export in the Alexandra Dock system was by hoists, in which loaded railway wagons are lifted from ground level, {{in order to}} tip the {{contents}} into the ships' holds. General cargoes were loaded and unloaded by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cranes,</b> which had capacities from 3 to 30 tons.|$|R
500|$|The Croatian Coast Guard {{was formed}} in October 2007, and Šolta was {{assigned}} to the 1st Division, based in Split. During the same year the ship underwent a modernisation that included the installation of a new Sperry Marine radar, gyrocompass and GPS. [...] A second refit that occurred sometime between 2007 and 2013 included the deletion of the Strela launcher and the stern 20mm M-75 gun to create space needed for a RHIB and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> used to lower it into the sea. The pennant number was changed from OB-62 to OB-02.|$|E
2500|$|Options {{included}} a winch, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane,</b> tipping body, tankers and specialist-vehicles for refuelling operations. The optional [...] crane has {{a capacity of}} 6.5 t/m while the winch (produced by Reynolds Boughton) has a capacity of 5,500kg front and rear and is provided with 75 m of cable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} his <b>hydraulic</b> <b>crane</b> led Armstrong to {{consider}} setting up a business to manufacture cranes and other hydraulic equipment. He therefore resigned from his legal practice. Donkin, his legal colleague, supported him in his career move, providing financial backing for the new venture. In 1847 the firm of W. G. Armstrong & Company bought [...] of land alongside the river at Elswick, near Newcastle, and began to build a factory there. The new company received orders for hydraulic cranes from Edinburgh and Northern Railways and from Liverpool Docks, {{as well as for}} hydraulic machinery for dock gates in Grimsby. The company soon began to expand. In 1850 the company produced 45 cranes and two years later, 75. It averaged 100 cranes per year {{for the rest of the}} century. In 1850 over 300 men were employed at the works, but by 1863 this had risen to 3,800. The company soon branched out into bridge building, one of the first orders being for the Inverness Bridge, completed in 1855.|$|E
5000|$|Rapid growth, {{primarily}} due {{to demand}} for the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cranes,</b> resulted in the company expanding to over 1,000 employees by 1967. That same year, against John's wishes, Grove Manufacturing was sold to the Walter Kidde Company. Internal strife between the brothers, and possible health issues, caused John to leave the company in 1968.|$|R
