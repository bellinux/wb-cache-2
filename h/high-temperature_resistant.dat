Over {{a number}} of decades, titanium aluminide intermetallics have been of high scientific and industrial interest due to their good mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. Despite Ti 3 Al and TiAl receiving {{the vast majority of}} this interest, less work has been conducted on the Al???Ti intermetallics. In the present work, titanium aluminide (Al???Ti) has been reactively processed from elemental powder using a combined mechanical and electrical activation approach. The effect of mechanical activation and electric current intensity on the ignition and phase development is discussed. An increase in current intensity was found to result in an increase in product homogeneity and product porosity. A secondary reaction and sustained glow was found to occur only at the higher current intensity used, which in turn increased the product homogeneity. Ignition was not possible when powders were milled for short durations, while prolonged milling resulted in mechanical activation that promoted a self-propagating type ignition event. The time to reaction (where the whole compact was engulfed with the reaction wave) was found to decrease with an increase in current intensity.

While many HT resistant products are known, not simple appears to satisfy the requirement of their high and stable adhesion on the support. The aim of this work was to develop novel HT resistant ceramic coatings based on silicon carbide and/or zirconium oxide, using geopolymeric resins as binders. Geopolymers show many advantages respect to organic polymers, first of all their high heat resistance and refractoriness. Moreover, they are fully inorganic, do not require organic solvents and are not off-gassing. During the geopolymerization step, the polymineral resin (alumino-silicate binders) is formed, acting as glue sticking together the unreacted Al-Si source materials and fillers (ceramic powders), forming the ceramic-geopolymer composite coatings. In order to optimize the geopolimeric binders, different raw materials have been tested (caolins, meta-kaolins and alumina/silica fine powders), while the alkali aqueous solution was KOH/K 2 SiO 3, fixing the ratios SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 4 and SiO 2 /K 2 O = 2.

While initial fabrication advances in microfluidics involved mainly the etching of silicon and glass, the economics of scaling of these materials is not amendable for point-of-care usage where single-test applications forces cost considerations to be kept low and throughput high. As such, a materials base more consistent with point-of-care needs is required. In this manuscript, the fabrication of a hot embossed, through-hole low-density polyethylene ensembles derived from an anisotropically etched silicon wafer is discussed. This semi-opaque polymer that can be easily sterilized and recycled provides low background noise for fluorescence measurements and yields more affordable cost than other thermoplastics commonly used for microfluidic applications such as cyclic olefin copolymer (COC). To fabrication through-hole microchips from this alternative material for microfluidics, a fabrication technique that uses a <b>high-temperature,</b> high-pressure <b>resistant</b> mold is described.

40|$|Advanced {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (TBC) {{are crucial to}} improved energy efficiency in next generation gas turbine engines. The use of traditional topcoat materials, e. g. yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), is limited at elevated temperatures due to (i) the accelerated undesirable phase transformations, and (ii) high temperature corrosive attacks from calcium-magnesium-aluminum-silicate (CMAS) deposits and moisture. In this research, the Solution Precursor Plasma Spray (SPPS) process was employed first to further reduce the thermal conductivity of conventional YSZ TBCs by introducing a microstructural feature of layered porosity, called the inter-pass boundaries (IPBs), that disrupts heat conduction in the coatings. Process optimization involving extensive scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization and laser-flash measurements on hundreds of spray trials, yielded a thermal conductivity as low as 0. 623 Wm- 1 K- 1 in SPPS YSZ TBCs, which equated an approximately 50 % reduction than the standard air-plasma-sprayed (APS) TBCs. At the same time, other engine critical properties of the low thermal conductivity SPPS TBCs, such as cyclic durability, erosion resistance and sintering resistance, were characterized to be equivalent or better than the APS baselines. To enhance the high temperature capability of SPPS TBCs, modifications {{were introduced to the}} SPPS YSZ TBCs so as to improve their resistance to CMAS and moisture under harsh IGCC environments. Several mitigation approaches were explored, including doping the coatings with Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2, applying a CMAS infiltration-inhibiting surface layer, and filling topcoat cracks with blocking substances. The efficacy of these modifications on CMAS resistance was assessed with a set of novel CMAS-TBC interaction tests, while the moisture resistance was evaluated in a custom-built high-temperature moisture rig. In the end, the optimal coating system was evaluated to be consisted of a thick inner layer of SPPS YSZ having the low thermal conductivity, and a <b>high-temperature</b> stable CMAS <b>resistant</b> gadolinium zirconate (GZO) protective surface layer made by the SPPS process.

40|$|The {{development}} of high-temperature electrochemical {{devices such as}} oxygen and hydrogen separators, fuel gas reformers, solid oxide fuel cells, and chemical sensors {{is part of a}} rapidly expanding segment of the solid state technology market. These devices employ an ionic conducting ceramic as the active membrane that establishes the electrochemical potential of the device, either under voltage (i. e. to carry out gas separation) or under chemical gradient (to develop an electrical potential and thereby generate electrical power). Because the device operates under an ionic gradient that develops across the electrolyte, hermiticity across this layer is paramount. That is, not only must this thin ceramic membrane be dense with no interconnected porosity, but it must be connected {{to the rest of the}} device, typically constructed from a heat resistant alloy, with a high-temperature, gas-tight seal. A significant engineering challenge in fabricating these devices is how to effectively join the thin electrochemically active membrane to the metallic body of the device such that the resulting seal is hermetic, rugged, and stable during continuous high temperature operation. Active metal brazing is the typical method of joining ceramic and metal engineering components. It employs a braze alloy that contains one or more reactive elements, often titanium, which will chemically reduce the ceramic faying surface and greatly improve its wetting behavior and adherence with the braze. However, recent studies of these brazes for potential use in fabricating high-temperature electrochemical devices revealed problems with interfacial oxidation and subsequent joint failure [1, 2]. Specifically, it was found that the introduction of the ceramic electrolyte and/or heat resistant metal substrate dramatically affects the inherent oxidation behavior of the braze, often in a deleterious manner. These conclusions pointed to the need for an oxidation <b>resistant,</b> <b>high-temperature</b> ceramic-to-metal braze and consequently lead to the {{development of}} the novel reactive air brazing (RAB) concept. The goal in RAB is to reactively modify one or both oxide faying surfaces with an oxide compound dissolved in a molten noble metal alloy such that the newly formed surface is readily wetted by the remaining liquid filler material. In many respects, this concept is similar to active metal brazing, except that joining can be conducted in air and the final joint will be resistant to oxidation at high temperature. Potentially, there are a number of metal oxide-noble metal systems that can be considered for RAB, including Ag-CuO, Ag-V 2 O 5, and Pt-Nb 2 O 5. Our current interest is in determining whether the Ag-CuO system is suitable for air brazing functional ceramic-to-metal joints such as those needed in practical electrochemical devices. In a series of studies, the wetting behavior of the Ag-CuO braze was investigated with respect to a number of potential hydrogen separation, oxygen separation, and fuel cell electrolyte membrane materials and heat resistant metal systems, including: alumina, (La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4) (Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8) O 3, (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) FeO 3, YSZ, fecralloy, and Crofer- 22 APU.

40|$|<b>High-temperature</b> <b>resistant</b> {{light-weight}} {{materials for}} construction {{are in the}} focus of world-wide research. We report on the determination of elastic wave velocities in carbon-reinforced carbon material using laser ultrasonics. This technique allows for ultrasonic measurements at high temperatures due to the contact-free generation of ultrasound by short laser pulses and the interferometric. detection of the resulting surface displacement. Hence, measurements {{can be carried out}} remotely. Since the CFC-material shows high ultrasonic attenuation and strong scattering due to its laminar structure, distinction between and interpretation of the different peaks occuring in the detected ultrasonic signal becomes very difficult. Combining measurements carried out at room temperatrue for the identification of the various modes with the ones obtained at high temperatures, it is possible to obtain the temperature dependent elastic contants. First results will be shown, comparing theoretical model ing and experiment as well as measurements of the sound veolcity up to 1400 ø...|$|E
