5|$|While it {{was long}} {{believed}} that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> accelerate.|$|E
50|$|As soon as Lord Lindsey <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> {{fear that}} the {{disputes}} between the King and Parliament must end in war, he <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> exercise and train his tenantry in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, of whom he had formed a regiment of infantry.|$|R
60|$|On this {{beautiful}} isle, {{at the time}} of our tale, the churches and houses of Christian men <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> rise. The natives <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> cultivate the arts of civilisation, and to appreciate, in some degree, the inestimable blessings of Christianity. The plough had torn up the virgin soil, and the anchors of merchant-ships <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> kiss the strand. The crimes peculiar to civilised men had not yet been developed. The place had all the romance and freshness of a flourishing infant colony.|$|R

5|$|Early in his career, Barton mainly {{played a}} {{defensive}} role, with a game based on tackling and tracking back {{to shield the}} defence. As his career has progressed, he <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> incorporate a more attacking approach to his play, which {{has resulted in a}} greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E
60|$|Derek {{smiled a}} ghastly smile. This was not wholly due to mental disturbance. The dull {{heaviness}} {{which was the}} legacy of the Dry-Salters' dinner <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> change to something more actively unpleasant. A sub-motive of sharp pain <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> run through it, flashing in and out like lightning through a thunder-cloud. He felt sullen and vicious.|$|R
5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations.

5|$|Suppressed {{during the}} era of {{communist}} Poland, {{after the fall of}} communism in Poland, Dmowski's legacy <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be more widely recognized. A bridge in Wrocław was named after him in 1992. In November 2006 statue of Roman Dmowski was unveiled in Warsaw; it had led to a series of protests from organizations which see Dmowski as fascist and opponent of tolerance; due to similar protests plans to raise statues or memorials elsewhere have commonly been delayed.|$|E
5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.|$|E

Maida uses the information, as well as feedback from a traditional musical group distantly related to Pahing, {{to discover that the}} house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera– with whom she <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> fall in love– find documents showing the history of the house. With the help of her mother's former lover Kuan (Henky Solaiman), she discovers the true ownership of the house.|$|E
5|$|Among the Antaimoro people, the {{production}} of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> market to eco-tourists. Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development {{of fine arts in}} Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|At Castle Black, {{the body}} of Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is {{discovered}} by Ser Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), and loyal members of the Night's Watch protect his lifeless body.

5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

Utterson and Newcome arrive to arrest Hyde; knowing he can no longer transform back into Jekyll, Hyde commits suicide by taking poison.|$|E
5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} a prologue {{during the summer of}} 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from {{ethereal}} monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> cough badly. The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where Nier and Yonah are now living in a village built upon the ruins of an old town. The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of train tracks and industrial machinery.
