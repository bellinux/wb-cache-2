5|$|This {{approach}} was first {{applied to the}} <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction</b> catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} {{reaction is}} an equilibrium, {{which can be}} shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction</b> is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions</b> of amitraz {{strongly}} {{depend on}} the environmental pH. Even though amitraz undergoes <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions</b> at any pH, spectrophotometry, HPLC, and GC-MS studies revealed that pH-depending differences occur, affecting both the sort of reaction-products and the reaction rate. [...] Under basic conditions (pH>6) amitraz is metabolized to 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide. Followed by hydrolysis to 2,4-dimethylaniline, which also benefits from a basic pH. [...] At very acidic pH (pH<3) 2,4-dimethylaniline has been observed as the main degradation product. Under less acidic conditions (pH 3-6) mainly N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N′-methylformamidine and already amounts of 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide occur.|$|R
25|$|In vivo, {{chymotrypsin}} is a {{proteolytic enzyme}} (Serine protease) {{acting in the}} digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction,</b> which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse amide bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.|$|E

[...] In Lewis theory an acid, A, and a base, B:, form an adduct, AB, in which the electron pair is used to form a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is illustrated {{with the formation of}} the adduct H3N−BF3 from ammonia and boron trifluoride, a reaction that cannot occur in aqueous solution because boron trifluoride reacts violently with water in a <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} report on {{asymmetric}} indole hydrogenation, N-acetyl 2-substituted indoles could be protected with high yields and ee of 87-95%. [...] 3-substituted indoles were less successful, with hydrolysis of the protecting group outcompeting the hydrogenation of the indole. Switching to an N-tosyl protecting group inhibited the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction</b> and allowed both 2- and 3-substituted indoles to be hydrogenated in high yield and ee. The problem with both methods, however, is that N-acetyl and N-tosyl groups require harsh cleavage conditions {{that might be}} incompatible with complex substrates. Using an easily cleaved N-Boc group would relieve this problem, and highly effective methods for the asymmetric hydrogenation of such indoles (both 2- and 3-substituted) were soon developed.|$|E

2500|$|Silica aerogels are {{typically}} synthesized {{by using a}} sol-gel process. The first step {{is the creation of}} a colloidal suspension of solid particles known as a [...] "sol". The precursors are a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide, such as tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates). The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reaction</b> which forms particles of silicon dioxide. The oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either M–O–M, [...] "oxo" [...] bridges or M–OH–M, [...] "ol" [...] bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles. [...] These reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates, and as a result either acidic or basic catalysts are used to improve the processing speed. Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDistinct and {{simultaneous}} COS and HCN <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions</b> over {{an industrial}} TiO 2 based catalyst were extensively studied {{in this work}} in the scope of synthesis gas purification applications. 144 experiments were carried out, including 92 experiments that allowed to achieve partial conversion rates and showed reaction kinetics sensitivity to operating parameters. Significant crossed influences were evidenced between both COS and HCN <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions.</b> The concomitant occurrence of both reactions showed to detrimentally affect each other upon COS and HCN conversion rates, and therefore upon kinetic rates. This was explained through a competitive adsorption of HCN and COS reactants upon catalyst surface active sites. Inhibition of catalytic activity {{by the presence of}} NH 3 and H 2 O (over a certain amount for the latter) was also evidenced and explained through competitive adsorption phenomena. For the operating conditions ranges explored, H 2 S and CO 2 had no sensitive impact on the kinetics of the COS and HCN <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions.</b> However the moderate impact of CO 2 upon COS and HCN conversion rates might be explained by the large CO 2 excess compared to COS and HCN levels.

40|$|A novel heteropoly acid (HPA) /nitrogen {{functionalized}} onion‐like carbon (NOLC) hybrid catalyst was synthesized through supramolecular (electrostatic {{and hydrogen}} bond) {{interactions between the}} two components. The chemical structure and acid strength of the HPA/NOLC hybrid have been fully characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NH 3 temperature‐programmed desorption and acid–base titration measurements. The proposed method for the fabrication of the HPA/NOLC hybrid catalyst is a universal strategy for different types of HPAs to meet various requirements of acidic or redox catalysis. The hydrophobic environment of NOLC effectively prevents the deactivation of HPA in an aqueous system, and the combination of uniformly dispersed HPA clusters and the synergistic effect between NOLC and HPA significantly promotes its activity in ester <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>reactions,</b> which is {{higher than that of}} bare PWA as homogeneous catalyst.
