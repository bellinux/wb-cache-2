50|$|Born in Angers, Moreau was a choirboy at the Cathédrale Saint-Maurice d'Angers, and it {{was there}} that he {{received}} his musical education. He worked in Langres and Dijon for short periods, before moving to Paris to become a court musician. He eventually was appointed master of music at the court and was awarded a pension from the king upon his retirement. Moreau contributed original music to the premieres of the final two plays of Racine, Esther and Athalie. Moreau also composed musical interludes for <b>Duche's</b> Jonathas, Boyer's Jephte, Absalon, Debora and various divertissements. He was also active as a teacher and counts among his pupils Louis-Nicolas Clérambault, Jean-François Dandrieu, and Michel Pignolet de Montéclair. He died in Paris.|$|R

25|$|On 18 July 1806 it was {{captured}} by the French under André Masséna, after an heroic defence. It was created a <b>duché</b> grand-fief in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples, but under the French name Gaete, for finance minister Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin, in 1809 (family extinguished in 1841).|$|E
25|$|Lapérouse {{was well}} liked by his men. Among his 114-man crew there were ten scientists: Joseph Lepaute Dagelet (1751–1788), an {{astronomer}} and mathematician; Robert de Lamanon, a geologist; La Martinière, a botanist; a physicist; three naturalists; and three illustrators, Gaspard <b>Duché</b> de Vancy and an uncle and nephew named Prévost. Another {{of the scientists}} was Jean-André Mongez. Even both chaplains were scientifically schooled.|$|E
25|$|Gaeta {{was turned}} into a <b>duché</b> grand-fief in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples with the French name of Gaete. The duchy was awarded to finance {{minister}} Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin on 15 August 1809. After the collapse of the Joachim Murat's kingdom in the Neapolitan War, Gaeta was the last city to hold out. The 1815 siege lasted from 28 May to 8 August before the surviving 133 officers and 1,629 men of the Neapolitan garrison surrendered to Austrian General-major Joseph von Lauer.|$|E
25|$|The Duchy of Brittany (Breton: Dugelezh Breizh, French: <b>Duché</b> de Bretagne) was {{a medieval}} feudal state that existed between {{approximately}} 939 and 1547. Its territory covered the northwestern peninsula of Europe, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the west, the English Channel to the north, and less definitively by the Loire River to the south, and Normandy and other French provinces to the east. The Duchy was established after {{the expulsion of}} Viking armies from the region around 939. The Duchy, in the 10th and 11th centuries, was politically unstable, with the dukes holding only limited power outside their own personal lands. The Duchy had mixed relationships with the neighbouring Duchy of Normandy, sometimes allying itself with Normandy, and at other times, such as the Breton-Norman War, entering into open conflict.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Duché</b> {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1737, the son of Colonel Jacob <b>Duché,</b> Sr., later mayor of Philadelphia (1761–1762) and {{grandson}} of Anthony <b>Duché,</b> a French Huguenot. [...] He was educated at the Philadelphia Academy {{and then in the}} first class of the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), where he also worked as a tutor of Greek and Latin. After graduating as valedictorian in 1757, he studied briefly at Cambridge University before being ordained an Anglican clergyman by the Bishop of London and returning to the colonies.|$|E
2500|$|When the British {{occupied}} Philadelphia in September 1777, <b>Duché</b> {{was arrested}} and detained, underlining the seriousness of his actions. [...] He was later released, at which time he wrote a famous letter to General George Washington, camped at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in which he begged him to lay down arms and negotiate for peace with the British. [...] Suddenly, <b>Duché</b> went from hero of the Revolutionary cause to outcast in the new United States. He was convicted of high treason to the State of Pennsylvania, and his estate was confiscated. In consequence, <b>Duché</b> fled to England, where he was appointed chaplain to the Lambeth orphan asylum, and soon made a reputation as an eloquent preacher. He {{was not able to}} return to America until 1792, after he had suffered a stroke.|$|E
2500|$|On July 4, 1776, {{when the}} United States Declaration of Independence was ratified, <b>Duché,</b> {{meeting with the}} church's vestry, passed a {{resolution}} stating that the name of King George III of Great Britain was no longer to be read in the prayers of the church. [...] <b>Duché</b> complied, crossing out said prayers from his Book of Common Prayer, committing an act of treason against England, an extraordinary and dangerous act for a clergyman who had taken an oath of loyalty to the King. On July 9, Congress elected him its first official chaplain.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 July 1806 the French under André Masséna {{captured}} Gaeta {{after an}} heroic defence. In 1809 {{it became a}} <b>duché</b> grand-fief in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples, but under the French name [...] "Gaete", for finance minister Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Duché</b> {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of the First Continental Congress in September 1774, when he was summoned to Carpenters' Hall to lead the opening prayers. [...] Opening the session on the 7th of that month, he read the 35th Psalm, and then broke into extemporaneous prayer.|$|E
2500|$|His daughter, Elizabeth Sophia <b>Duché</b> (born on September 18, 1774, Philadelphia; died on December 11, 1808, Montréal), married Captain John Henry in 1799. [...] Henry was an Army {{officer and}} {{political}} adventurer who was indirectly {{instrumental in the}} declaration of war on Great Britain by the United States in 1812.|$|E
2500|$|The Potteries has a {{distinctive}} local dialect. Whilst it contains many non-standard words (e.g. nesh meaning [...] "soft, tender, or to easily get cold"; and slat meaning [...] "to throw"), {{the best known}} word is duck, which {{is used as a}} greeting to either men or women. It is believed to be derived from the Saxon word ducas, used to indicate respect; in Middle English this became duc or duk, which denotes a leader; in turn, it became the title Duke and the Old French word <b>duché,</b> which indicates the territory ruled by a Duke.|$|E
6000|$|Upon this, Mr. Samuel Adams arose and said: [...] "He would willingly join {{in prayer}} with any gentleman of piety and virtue, {{whatever}} {{might be his}} cloth, provided {{he was a friend}} of his country;" [...] and he moved that the reverend Mr. <b>Duché,</b> of Philadelphia, who answered to that description, might be invited to officiate as chaplain. This was one step towards unanimity of feeling, Mr. Adams being a strong Congregationalist, and Mr. <b>Duché</b> an eminent Episcopalian clergyman. The motion was carried into effect; the invitation was given and accepted.|$|E
6000|$|The reverend Mr. <b>Duché,</b> {{according}} to invitation, {{appeared in his}} canonicals, attended by his clerk. The morning service of the Episcopal church was read with great solemnity, the clerk making the responses. The Psalter for the 7th day of the month includes the 35th Psalm, wherein David prays for protection against his enemies. [...] "Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.|$|E
6000|$|The imploring {{words of}} this psalm, spoke the {{feelings}} of all hearts present; but especially of those from New England. John Adams writes {{in a letter to}} his wife: [...] "You must remember this was the morning after we heard the horrible rumor of the cannonade of Boston. I never saw a greater effect upon an audience. It seemed as if heaven had ordained that psalm to be read on that morning. After this, Mr. <b>Duché</b> unexpectedly struck out into an extemporary prayer, which filled the bosom of every man present. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself never prayed with such fervor, such ardor, such earnestness and pathos, and in language so eloquent and sublime, for America, for the Congress, for the province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the town of Boston. It has had an excellent effect upon every body here." [...] [Footnote: John Adams' Correspondence and Diary.] ...|$|E
