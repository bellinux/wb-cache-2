40|$|As higher {{resolution}} <b>data</b> <b>converters</b> capable of direct IF-sampling come to market, system designers need help making performance/cost trade-off decisions on low jitter clock circuits. Many {{of the traditional}} methods used to specify clock jitter are not applicable to <b>data</b> <b>converters</b> or at best reveal {{only a fraction of}} the story. Without a proper understanding of how to specify and design the clocking circuit, optimal performance of these new <b>data</b> <b>converters</b> may not be achieved. A simple jitter specification is rarely sufficient for making an informed clock selection. Rather, it is important to know the bandwidth and spectral shape of the clock noise so that this can be properly accounted for during the sampling process.

It is therefore crucial to select suitable system components, which help generate a low phase-jitter clock. The following application note serves as a valuable guide for selecting the appropriate components to design a low-phase noise PLL-based clock generator, suitable for ultra-fast <b>data</b> <b>converters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sigma delta {{modulators}} (ΣΔMs) {{form part}} of the core of today’s mixed-signal de-signs. They are cornerstone components of oversampled <b>data</b> <b>converters.</b> Such <b>data</b> <b>converters</b> take advantage of digital signal processing techniques and VLSI technology to provide high performance with low sensitivity to analog component imperfections and noisy conditions. The ongoing research on these devices shows the potential of ΣΔ <b>data</b> <b>converters</b> as a promising candidate for high-speed, high-resolution, and low-power mixed-signal interfaces. As for any electronic system, efficient modeling and simulation tools are essential in the design cycle of oversampled converters, par-ticularly for their embedded ΣΔMs. Although transistor-level simulation is the most accurate approach known for these components, this method becomes impractical for complex systems due to the long computational time required. This situation has led circuit designers to consider alternate modeling techniques. Among these, the simulation of ΣΔMs using behavioral models has {{become the focus of}} attention for {{a large portion of the}} design community. This thesis presents an accurate behav...|$|R
