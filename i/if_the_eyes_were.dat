60|$|I {{ran to the}} Hall—I {{dared not}} go to the Kennels. In a short time I was back with the squire and three men. As I led the way, I saw the child lifting a corner of the {{handkerchief}} to peep and see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> closed in sleep. Then he heard us, and started violently. When we removed the covering, and he saw the face unchanged in its horror, he looked at me with a look I have never forgotten.|$|E
60|$|These hags {{were very}} ugly but when one-eyed Blinkie whispered her orders to them they grinned with joy {{as they began}} dancing around Gloria.

60|$|I {{followed}} him to the chamber where death was hovering. The dark hangings of the large bed made a background that gave a strong relief to Bertha's pale face as I entered. She started forward as she saw me enter, and then looked at Meunier with an expression of angry inquiry; but he lifted up his hand as it to impose silence, while he fixed his glance on the dying woman and felt her pulse. The face was pinched and ghastly, a cold perspiration was on the forehead, and the eyelids were lowered so as to conceal the large dark eyes. After a minute or two, Meunier walked round {{to the other side of}} the bed where Bertha stood, and with his usual air of gentle politeness towards her begged her to leave the patient under our care--everything should be done for her--she was no longer in a state to be conscious of an affectionate presence. Bertha was hesitating, apparently almost willing to believe his assurance and to comply. She looked round at the ghastly dying face, as if to read the confirmation of that assurance, when for a moment the lowered eyelids were raised again, and it seemed as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> looking towards Bertha, but blankly. A shudder passed through Bertha's frame, and she returned to her station near the pillow, tacitly implying that she would not leave the room.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Accidents due to {{drowsiness}} can {{be controlled}} and prevented with <b>the</b> help of <b>eye</b> blink sensor using IR rays. It consists of IR transmitter and an IR receiver. The transmitter transmits IR rays into <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> shut then <b>the</b> output <b>is</b> high. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open then <b>the</b> output is low. This output is interfaced with an alarm {{inside and outside the}} vehicle. This module can be connected to the braking system of the vehicle and can be used to reduce the speed of the vehicle. The alarm inside the vehicle will go on {{for a period of time}} until the driver is back to his senses. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> driver is unable to take control of the vehicle after that stipulated amount of time then the alarm outside the vehicle will go on to warn and tell others to help the driver...|$|R

40|$|Do {{locomotor}} aftereffects depend {{specifically on}} visual feedback? In 7 experiments, 116 college students were tested, with closed eyes, at stationary running or at walking to a previewed target after adaptation, with closed eyes, to treadmill locomotion. Subjects showed faster inadvertent drift during stationary running and increased distance (overshoot) when walking to a target. Overshoot seemed to saturate (i. e., reach a ceiling) at 17 % after {{as little as}} 1 min of adaptation. Sidestepping at test reduced overshoot, suggesting motor specificity. But inadvertent drift effects were decreased <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> open and the treadmill was drawn through the environment during adaptation, indicating that these effects involve self-motion perception. Differences in expression of inadvertent drift and of overshoot after adaptation to treadmill locomotion {{may have been due}} to different sets of ancillary cues available for the 2 tasks. Self-motion perception is multimodal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used ERPs to {{investigate}} {{the time course of}} implicit face processing. More specifically, we utilized a masked priming paradigm {{to investigate}} implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using a prime duration of 33 ms. Two types of prime–target pairs were used: (1) congruent (e. g., open eyes only in both prime and target); (2) incongruent (e. g., open eyes only in prime and open mouth only in target). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed one button to indicate whether the target face’s mouth was open, and another <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> open. The behavioral results indicated a congruent priming effect for upright but not for inverted faces. The ERP results indicated a face orientation effect across all ERP components studied (P 1, N 1, P 2, N 170, N 2, P 3) starting at about 80 ms, and a congruency/priming effect on late components (N 2, P 3), starting at about 200 ms. The functional significance of these ERP effects is discussed in relation to unconscious perception and configural face processing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo find {{correlation}} between the type of mutations observed and {{the severity of the}} disease using multiple techniques like polymerase chain reactions (PCR), quantitative multiplex PCR, sequencing and RNA analysis. MethodsProspective, observational study. Patients who had been screened for mutations in the RB 1 gene were included in the study. Patient details including demographic data; age and sex, laterality, international classification of intraocular retinoblastoma (ICIOR) staging, modality of management, histopathology high risk factors <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> enucleated and metastasis rate were assessed. ResultsSeventy four patients were studied. Fifty three patients had bilateral and 21 unilateral disease. Complete genetic data was analyzed for 74 patients and complete clinical correlation was established for all the 49 patients with mutations. Of the total mutations identified, 11 / 49 (22. 4 %) of patients had large deletions, 12 / 49 (24. 5 %) had small deletions or insertions, 14 / 49 (28. 6 %) had nonsense mutations, 7 / 49 (14. 3 %) had splice mutations and 5 / 49 (10. 2 %) of patients had missense mutations. Four cases were familial. Group E ICIOR stage at presentation was noted in 40 % of patients with large deletions, 33 % with small deletions whereas 38. 5 % with splice mutations and 44. 4 % of patients with missense mutations presented with Group B ICIOR. Twenty five percentages of eyes with large deletions had high risk features on histopathology and one patient among these developed metastasis. ConclusionCurrent laboratory testing of RB 1 mutations may be feasible in determining the severity of the disease and patient counseling. The study provides a starting point for looking at correlations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- We {{employ a}} novel method to avoid {{accidents}} due to Drowsy Driving in this Project. Firstly, an IR sensor pair {{is placed on}} the spectacles of the driver which monitor the frequency of eye-blink. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open <b>the</b> vehicle moves in its desired path. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed for a specific time interval than an alarm is given as warning to driver, even then <b>if</b> <b>the</b> driver is Drowsy then the vehicle, irrespective of its path it parks {{on the left side of}} the road. Two IR sensor pair are used for parking of vehicle in the left side of road. In this one IR Sensor pair is used for detection of white line and the other to detect whether there were any obstacle or vehicle in the left side while parking. The position of the vehicle i. e. latitude, longitude positions are sent as message to mobile via GSM. The path is controlled by switches on remote to move vehicle...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we used ERPs to {{investigate}} neural correlates of face processing. More specifically, we utilized a masked priming paradigm {{to investigate}} implicit processing {{of the eyes}} and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using prime duration of 50 ms. Three types of prime-target pairs were used: 1. congruent (e. g., open eyes only in both prime and target); 2. incongruent (e. g., open eyes only in prime and open mouth only in target) and 3. dual (both mouth and eyes open in the prime only followed by either type of target, i. e., either eyes or mouth but not both, open). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed one button to indicate whether the target face’s mouth was open, and an other <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> open. The behavioural results indicated a congruent priming effect for both upright and inverted faces. In addition, we found an enhanced negativity at about 200 ms after target presentation. The amplitude of the N 200 -like depended on the relation between prime and target, being smaller when the stimuli were congruent in both upright and inverted faces. This N 200 -like {{was followed by a}} P 300 component, which was influenced by the three conditions, with incongruency and dual producing a smaller positivity than congruency in both upright and inverted faces. Moreover, when the stimuli were presented upside down, the N 200 and the P 300 effects took place about 30 ms later. The functional significance of these ERP effects is discussed in relation to unconscious perception and configural face processing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Strabismus {{is one of}} {{the causes}} for visual {{impairment}} in childhood. It affects the development of binocular single vision. Therefore, early detection and timely management of strabismus is important. Aim: This study was aimed to describe types of strabismus patients presenting to a tertiary care center and the various management modalities including the surgical outcomes of ocular re-alignment Materials and Methods: Retrospective chart analysis of all patients with strabismus in any age group over a period of 5 years. Patients with cerebral palsy were excluded from this study. Surgical outcomes were graded as good <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> orthophoric post-operatively, satisfactory if there was a residual squint of less than 10 degrees, and it was considered to be a poor outcome if the patients were left with more than 10 degrees of residual squint. Results: Chart analysis of 53 cases with strabismus comprising of 33 males and 20 females was done. The mean age of patients was 25 years. Thirty-two (60 %) cases had exotropia, and 14 (26 %) had esotropia. Three cases were of congenital superior oblique palsy, and one case was of lateral rectus palsy. Duane syndrome type I was seen in four cases. Of the 38 (72 %) patients who were advised surgical correction, only 20 individuals underwent surgery. Reasons for refusal of surgery varied from fear factor to financial constraints and a disregard for cosmesis. Surgeries had been performed on both children (7) as well as adults (13). Seventy-five percent of the operated patients had exotropia. Eighteen patients underwent single-staged surgery. Bilateral recessions were {{the most common type of}} surgery noted in this study. Fifty percent of them remained orthophoric up to one year of post-operative follow up. Conclusion: Exotropia was the most common type of strabismus observed in this study. Successful ocular re-alignment was seen in majority of the patients following a single-stage procedure. Greater effort needs to be made to educate the public on need for early diagnosis and management...|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} extreme symptoms, steroids such as {{prednisone}} or triamcinolone are sometimes administered to attenuate the immune response and prevent long-term skin damage, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> involved.

50|$|One of {{the causes}} of the risks above is that the lens can rotate inside <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> PIOL <b>is</b> too short, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> {{incorrectly}} measured, or because the sulcus has a slightly oval shape (the height is slightly smaller than the width).

In contrast, all patients showed greater errors <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> moved horizontally during the memory period; however, errors of both vertical and horizontal components of memory-guided saccades were similar. Thus, inaccuracy of memory-guided saccades could not be simply attributed to failure to internally monitor change in horizontal gaze during the memory period. Instead, we propose that the greater saccadic errors which occurred when gaze changed during the memory period reflected a disruption of predictive mechanisms governing eye movements...|$|R
