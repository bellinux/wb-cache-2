5|$|The Dutch Artillery had {{available}} a {{total of}} 676 howitzers and field guns: 310 Krupp 75mm field guns, partly produced in licence; 52 105mm Bofors howitzers, the only really modern pieces; 144 obsolete Krupp 125mm guns; 40 150mm sFH13's; 72 Krupp 150mm L/24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152mm L/15 howitzers. As antitank-guns 386 Böhler 47mm L/39s were available, which were effective weapons but too few in number, being only at {{a third of the}} planned strength; another three hundred antiquated 6 Veld (57mm) and 8 Staal (84mm) field guns performed the same role for the covering forces. Only eight of the 120 modern 105mm pieces ordered from Germany had been <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the invasion. Most artillery was horse-drawn.|$|E
5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried {{with it a}} mandatory life sentence, so {{it was only in}} the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E

5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
