50|$|All Avellas came {{standard}} with 13 inch wheels, a four-speaker stereo, heated rear glass, {{anti-lock brakes}} (ABS), driver's side airbag, and door impact beams. Optional equipment included air conditioning, power locks, power mirrors, power windows, folding rear seats, dimming <b>interior</b> <b>mirror,</b> a tachometer, and aluminum wheels. The Avella {{was the first}} South Korean car in its class to offer dual airbags and ABS-brakes. The Delta version received a slightly reworked front end from its hatchback siblings.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{exterior}} remained little changed during its life, the car nevertheless underwent various improvements. When production restarted after the 1958 summer holiday shut-down, the <b>interior</b> <b>mirror</b> {{had been moved}} from its position {{on the top of}} the dashboard to a position at the top of the windscreen, improving the rear view for most drivers. It was also in 1958 that the windscreen wipers received their own electric motor: hitherto they had been mechanically powered from the camshaft with the help of a flexible linkage, a solution which Opel had first employed in 1937 on the Super Six ...|$|R
50|$|Built to {{exacting}} standards including aircon, {{leather seats}} and deluxe <b>interior,</b> electric <b>mirrors,</b> race logic launch and adjustable traction control, GEMS X25 ecu, hydraulic lift suspension, varex exhaust and Aspira own big brake kit.|$|R
50|$|A {{garage door}} opener {{integrated}} in the <b>interior</b> rear view <b>mirror</b> is also available.|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} and furnishings of the <b>interior</b> space <b>mirror</b> family roles and spiritual concepts. Each cardinal direction is significant, {{and the door}} always faces south. Herders use the sun's position in the crown of the yurt as a sundial.|$|R
50|$|Blind spots {{may occur}} {{in the front of}} the driver when the A-pillar (also called the {{windshield}} pillar), side-view <b>mirror,</b> or <b>interior</b> rear-view <b>mirror</b> block a driver's view of the road. Behind the driver, cargo, headrests, and additional pillars may reduce visibility.|$|R
5000|$|... 1985: March: ABS braking becomes {{optional}} on the CX 25 GTi Turbo. July: Introduction of {{the model}} year 1986 S2 (Series 2) CX, restyled in appearance. Plastic bumpers, a completely revised <b>interior,</b> new <b>mirrors,</b> and protective body strips {{are among the most}} obvious changes.|$|R
50|$|A new {{aftermarket}} <b>interior</b> rear-view <b>mirror</b> with {{a built-in}} OnStar module, branded as OnStar FMV, became {{available to the public}} on July 24, 2011. It provides some of the features an OEM system has, such as Automatic Crash Response, Stolen Vehicle Tracking, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, and Roadside Assistance.|$|R
50|$|For the {{autonomous}} applications a lidar with a 3D scanner {{is used for}} obstacle detection and collision avoidance. The scanner measures radial distance at different angular resolutions. The lidar emits a single laser ray and uses an <b>interior</b> rotating <b>mirror</b> to distribute the laser ray covering a large field of view.|$|R
50|$|The {{base level}} had the 2.0 litre, 141 hp engine, air conditioning, driver and {{passenger}} airbags, ABS, a traction control system, halogen headlamps, power steering, adjustable steering column, electrically adjustable driver's side seating, a six-speaker amplified audio system, heated folding side <b>mirrors,</b> self-dimming <b>interior</b> rear-view <b>mirror,</b> and a single-use spare tyre.|$|R
50|$|A Sport {{model was}} offered {{beginning}} in 1999 with eight-way power adjustable seats, heated front seats, 17-inch wheels, driver's seat memory, audible theft-deterrent system, three-channel garage door opener, high-intensity discharge headlamps, and a rear spoiler. The Catera received a facelift in 2000 with revised nose, tail, wheels, <b>interior</b> trim, <b>mirrors,</b> optional HID headlamps, stiffer suspension settings, and side airbags.|$|R
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{and most other}} {{components}} stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts came with 14-inch four-lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Fairmonts featured bucket seats, the 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main bearing unit, three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, blower heater, screen washers, chrome-plated <b>interior</b> <b>mirror,</b> seven <b>interior</b> door-operated lights, and a handbrake on warning light flasher as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models.|$|R
50|$|By 2011, {{the full}} range met the Euro 5 {{emission}} standard. It offered a new interior trim color palette. The <b>interior</b> had parabolic <b>mirrors</b> painted in Gloss Black. In 2011 the Ypsilon Unyca debuted.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} included power {{windows and}} mirrors, central locking, full leather <b>interior,</b> power <b>mirrors,</b> cruise control, air conditioning, heated front seats, alloy wheels and electrically powered radio antenna. The only optional extras were a limited-slip differential, {{a choice of}} stereos, and the no-cost option of a Borg-Warner three-speed automatic instead of the four-speed manual with electrically operated overdrive. By 1981, the manual option had been deleted in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Hotel Astor's success {{triggered}} {{the construction of}} the nearby Knickerbocker Hotel by other members of the Astor family two years later, although that property became commercial office space within a few years. The Astor set the pattern for [...] "a new species of popular hotels that soon clustered around Times Square, vast amusement palaces that catered to crowds with scenographic <b>interiors</b> that <b>mirrored</b> the theatricality of the Great White Way." ...|$|R
50|$|Female sphinxes with extravagantly {{elongated}} {{necks and}} prominent breasts support a Burgundian cabinet of walnut in the Frick Collection, New York; soon Antwerp made a specialty of richly carved and veneered cabinets inlaid with tortoiseshell, ebony, and ivory, with architectural <b>interiors,</b> <b>mirrored</b> to multiply reflections in feigned spaces. In England the Mannerist excesses of Jacobean furniture were expressed in extreme legs turned to imitate stacked covered standing cups, and {{a proliferation of}} enlaced strapwork covered plane surfaces. Following the success of Brussels tapestries woven after the Raphael cartoons, Mannerist painters like Bernard van Orley and Perino del Vaga were called upon to design cartoons in Mannerist style for the tapestry workshops of Brussels and Fontainebleau. Painterly compositions in Mannerist taste appeared in Limoges enamels too, adapting their compositions and ornamented borders from prints. Moresques, swags and festoons of fruit inspired by rediscovered Ancient Roman grotesque ornament, first displayed in the Raphael school Vatican Stanze, were disseminated through ornament prints. This ornamental vocabulary was expressed in the North less in such frescoes and more in tapestry and illuminated manuscript borders.|$|R
50|$|On November 24, Glenn Straub {{announced}} he was buying the Energenic power plant from ACR. ACR previously warned the city that bondholders were planning to foreclose on the power plant. The deal was announced after Atlantic City threatened to issue fines {{and said it would}} consider litigation if the building’s <b>interior</b> <b>dipped</b> below 40 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1994 Geneva Motor Show, Maserati {{launched}} an updated Ghibli. A refreshed <b>interior,</b> new wing <b>mirrors,</b> wider and larger 17" [...] alloy wheels {{of a new}} design, fully adjustable electronic suspension and ABS brakes were added. The Ghibli Open Cup single-make racing car was announced in late 1994.|$|R
25|$|For 2003 {{the design}} of the {{radiator}} grille, headlamp inner panels, and sills were altered. The <b>interior</b> and <b>mirrors</b> were altered, while the suspension and braking systems were also refined. The Skyline Coupe was introduced as a version of Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe for Japanese market. Also, the Skyline 350GT went on sale. It is a version of the Infiniti G35 sport sedan with a six-speed manual transmission for the Japanese market, only available with the 3.5 litre engine. The Skyline 350GT and Skyline 350GT Premium sedan went on sale on 2003-06-03.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of the {{introduction}} of the fourth generation, [...] "EyeSight" [...] was once again offered on the Japanese-spec Outback. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one on each side of the <b>interior</b> rear-view <b>mirror,</b> that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|R
50|$|The grille-mounted {{park and}} turn signal lenses were amber; prior years had colorless lenses with amber bulbs. The <b>interior</b> rear view <b>mirror</b> was mounted {{directly}} to the windshield {{rather than to the}} previous double-pivot roof bracket, and the parking brake was now foot- rather than hand-operated. Disc brakes became standard equipment on cars built after 1 January 1976.|$|R
50|$|The Holden HR {{range was}} {{released}} in April 1966, replacing the Holden HD series which had been in production since 1965. In addition to a revised grille, the HR featured a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels.Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after {{the launch of the}} HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, windscreen washers, reversing lights, sunvisors and a shatterproof <b>interior</b> rearview <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Lexus lineup, the GX is {{situated}} between its crossover counterpart, the RX, and the premium full-size LX. All GX production has {{occurred at the}} Tahara plant in Japan, alongside the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. In fact, both generations of the GX have been heavily based on the Prado, with updated frontal styling to better integrate with the Lexus design language. Elsewhere, the changes are less prominent and mainly restricted to minor trimmings, such as wheels and taillamp lenses inserts. The first generation <b>interior</b> largely <b>mirrors</b> that of the Toyota-badged version. The second generation interior has been further differentiated with fewer shared components.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} wheel has various control buttons for the cluster display, volume and telephone control {{and for the}} optional Linguatronic voice control system. On the electrically adjustable {{steering wheel}} column are also mounted the gearbox control lever, the stalk for controlling the speedtronic and cruise control functions, the main combination lever that operates the indicators, high beam and windscreen wipers and a stalk to adjust {{the steering wheel and}} control the optional heated steering wheel. Controls for the interior lighting and the sun roof or panoramic sun roof are mounted on the roof, near the <b>interior</b> rear-view <b>mirror.</b> This section also includes a compartment for sun glasses.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, the Brasileira was remodelled by Manuel Joaquim Norte Júnior (1878-1962) {{in order}} to provide a café, and again in 1922, to re-orient the {{business}} model {{in order to}} sell drinks, in addition to coffee. Its redesign, completed by architect José Pacheco, was completed in the Art Deco-style, with a green and gold entrance, and an <b>interior</b> that included <b>mirrored</b> walls, brass fittings, a long, oak bar and wooden booths.|$|R
2500|$|A {{lower body}} graced the 1957 Roadmaster {{with an even}} more {{panoramic}} windshield equipped with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled Sweepspear lined the bodysides and a chromed rear fender lower panel filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer [...] "Dagmar bumpers" [...] at the front. A new centered fuel filler {{was found in the}} rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was found within the deck and grille emblems. Two door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters but the four door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear <b>dip.</b> <b>Interiors</b> featured a padded dashboard and were broadcloth and nylon in 4-doors, nylon in 2-doors and leather in convertibles. There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door Riviera hardtop proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( [...] March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter [...] body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. [...] Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this [...] "sales plunge" [...] was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.|$|R
50|$|To {{commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Lincoln in 1971, a Golden Anniversary Town Car was {{offered as a}} limited-edition option for Continental buyers. Golden Anniversary Town Cars {{featured}} a full vinyl roof, unique leather <b>interior,</b> glovebox vanity <b>mirror,</b> 22 carat gold-plated keys, and a commemorative plaque on the dashboard. In addition to the Continental's other exterior color choices, a Golden Anniversary-exclusive gold moondust metallic paint was also available. Approximately 1,600 were produced.|$|R
40|$|We present {{two pieces}} of {{research}} in the area of visual behaviour and driving. Our first study investigated if there are differences in eye movement behaviour when viewing movies of driving passively, as if one were a passenger, and driving where one controls the action via steering. One group of participants was asked to complete a passive hazard perception task where they had to watch videos of driving situations and press a button when they spotted a hazard, and another group were asked to drive in a simulated environment and press a button when they spotted the hazard. Eye movements were recorded throughout. We found that individuals attended to more of the roadway both horizontal and vertically and were faster at fixating the hazards in the passive task than the active task. We suggest that these results may imply that standard passive tests have limited utility when developing visual models of driving behaviour. Our second study investigated whether we can use expert eye movement information to train more efficient looking patterns when driving. Two groups of inexperienced drivers undertook two simulated drives one week apart whilst eye movements were tracked. One group was asked to watch pre-recorded videos of eye movements of an expert driver before the second driving session. The other group (control) was not shown the eye movement videos. We found that, after watching the videos, drivers exhibited increased horizontal visual scanning of the road and an increase of fixations towards the <b>interior</b> <b>mirror</b> and driver-side mirror. The control group showed no such improvement in visual behaviour. The results show that eye movement cueing can be used to train more efficient search strategies in a dynamic task such as driving and may highlight a possible training intervention method which can be introduced to educate early stage drivers...|$|R
40|$|The laser and optics {{system for}} the photon {{collider}} seeks to minimize the required laser power by using an optical stacking cavity to recirculate the laser light. An enhancement of between 300 to 400 is desired. In order to achieve this the laser pulses which drive the cavity must precisely match the phase of the pulse circulating within the cavity. We report on simulations {{of the performance of}} a stacking cavity to various variations of the drive laser in order to specify the required tolerances of the laser system. We look at the behavior of a simple four mirror cavity as shown in Fig. 1. As a unit input pulse is applied to the coupling mirror a pulse begins to build up in the interior of the cavity. If the drive pulses and the interior pulse arrive at the coupling mirror in phase the interior pulse will build up to a larger value. The achievable enhancement is a strong function of the reflectivity of the cavities. The best performance if attained when the reflectivities of the input coupler is matched to the internal reflectivities of the cavity. In Fig. 2 we show the build up of the internal pulse after a certain number of drive pulses, assuming the input coupler has a reflectivity of 0. 996 and the <b>interior</b> <b>mirrors</b> have 0. 998 reflectivity. With these parameters the cavity will reach an enhancement factor of 450. Reducing the coupler reflectivity gives a faster cavity loading rate but with a reduced enhancement of the internal pulse. The enhancement as a function of coupler reflectivity and total internal cavity reflectivity is shown in Fig. 3. The best enhancement is achieved when the coupling mirror is matched to the reflectivity of the cavity. A coupler reflectivity just below the internal cavity reflectivity minimizes the required laser power...|$|R

The small room is transformed into an infinite world, while a viewer from outside the room will see a distorted shadow through the window. The opulent <b>interior</b> of the <b>mirror</b> room is simply perceived as flat shadows and reflections from the outside.|$|R
30|$|Little {{is known}} about the manner in which drivers {{interact}} with new technologies in vehicles. Many such technologies are thought to increase the risk of driver distraction since they may increase the likelihood that the driver will take his or her “eyes off the road” during the driving task and hence not focus on the traffic conditions (i.e., become ‘distracted’) thereby increasing the crash-risk. In this study, ‘eyes-off-road’ is defined as any point during driving at which the visual attention is diverted away from the road towards the vehicle <b>interior</b> or <b>mirrors.</b> Hedlund [1] provides a useful definition of distraction; he defines it as being “a diversion of attention from driving, because the driver is temporarily focusing on an object, person, task or event not related to driving, which reduces the driver’s awareness, decision making ability and/or performance, leading to an increased risk of corrective actions, near-crashes, or crashes”.|$|R
