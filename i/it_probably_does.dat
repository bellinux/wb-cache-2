25|$|The {{ozone layer}} has {{little effect on}} the longer UV {{wavelengths}} called UV-A (315–400nbsp&nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see ultraviolet for more information on near ultraviolet).|$|E
500|$|Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is {{assessed}} as [...] "Data Deficient" [...] on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it may be}} endangered {{because of}} its narrow ecological preferences. Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites {{where it has been}} recorded have already been destroyed. Forest loss is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats. Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to the {{assertion}} of Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code, it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> symbolize Christ and His twelve apostles. The apse mosaic in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual {{to use the term}} [...] "crux gemmata" [...] for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.|$|E
2500|$|The boreal {{woodland}} caribou (forest-dwelling) ecotype is found discontinuously, mainly between the 49th and 55th parallels. In 2003 its distribution covered 235 000 km2,mainly {{east of the}} 72nd meridian. This sedentary ecotype is found almost exclusively in the boreal forest, principally in areas with long forest fire cycles. Its abundance has also decreased over the years. Large forest-dwelling populations still persisted during the 1950s and 1960s, but they apparently disappeared. The current abundance is not known precisely, but based on density estimates and considering the current distribution, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not exceed 3000 individuals. Current data are insufficient to identify precisely {{the causes of the}} population decline, although hunting seems to be an important proximal cause." ...|$|E
2500|$|Avot de-Rabbi Nathan (...) , usually printed {{together}} with the minor tractates of the Talmud, is a Jewish aggadic work probably compiled in the geonic era (c.700–900 CE). Although Avot de-Rabbi Nathan is the first and longest of the [...] "minor tractates", <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not belong in that collection chronologically, having more {{the character of a}} late midrash. In the form now extant it contains a mixture of Mishnah and Midrash, and may be technically designated as a homiletical exposition of the Mishnaic tractate Pirkei Avot, having for its foundation an older recension (version) of that tractate. It may be considered as a kind of [...] "tosefta" [...] or [...] "gemarah" [...] to the Mishna Avot, which does not possess a traditional gemarah. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan contains many sentences, proverbs, and incidents that are not found anywhere else in the early rabbinical literature [...] Other rabbinical sayings appear in a more informal style than what is found in the canonical Mishna Avot redacted by Judah I.|$|E
25|$|Null {{result is}} a term often used in science to {{indicate}} evidence of absence. A search for water on the ground may yield a null result (the ground is dry); therefore, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not rain.|$|R
25|$|In the west, the civitas and its later diocese {{stretched}} {{towards the}} Dijle river, {{and then the}} Scheldt which it flows into, but might not have reached this limit in all areas.

5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|R
60|$|Apparently, however, it does not. It {{seems to}} be a train that starts out from Munich at 1.45, and goes off on the loose. Possibly, it is a young, romantic train, fond of mystery. It won't say where it's going to. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not even know itself. It goes off in search of adventure.|$|E
6000|$|There was Highland {{as well as}} Lowland {{blood in}} the veins of young Laidlaw. This sanguinary mixture is {{generally}} believed to possess effervescing properties when stirred. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does.</b> For one moment the strength of Goliath of Gath seemed to tingle in David's frame, and the vision of two policemen's heads battered together swam before his eyes--but he {{thought better of it}} and restrained himself! ...|$|E
60|$|Young {{people and}} unseasoned people, Benham argued, {{are apt to}} imagine that if fear is {{increased}} and carried to an extreme pitch it becomes unbearable, one will faint or die; given a weak heart, a weak artery or any such structural defect and that may well happen, {{but it is just}} as possible that as the stimulation increases one passes through a brief ecstasy of terror to a new sane world, exalted but as sane as normal existence. There is the calmness of despair. Benham had made some notes to enforce this view, of the observed calm behaviour of men already hopelessly lost, men on sinking ships, men going to execution, men already maimed and awaiting the final stroke, {{but for the most part}} these were merely references to books and periodicals. In exactly the same way, he argued, we exaggerate the range of pain as if it were limitless. We think if we are unthinking that it passes into agony and so beyond endurance to destruction. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> nothing of the kind. Benham compared pain to the death range of the electric current. At a certain voltage it thrills, at a greater it torments and convulses, at a still greater it kills. But at enormous voltages, as Tesla was the first to demonstrate, it does no injury. And following on this came memoranda on the recorded behaviour of martyrs, on the self-torture of Hindoo ascetics, of the defiance of Red Indian prisoners.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{of these}} more {{practical}} devices, its main purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not have a dial. The wheels and gears are mounted in a four-post wrought iron frame. The framework was not held together with nuts and bolts (which had not been invented), but rather with metal wedged tenons.|$|R
2500|$|However, a 2014 {{analysis}} of a biomechanical model of its skull suggested that unlike Deinosuchus, Sarcosuchus {{may not have been}} able to perform the [...] "death roll" [...] maneuver used by extant crocodylians to dismember their prey. This suggests that if S. imperator did hunt big game, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not dismember prey in the same fashion as extant crocodylians.|$|R
60|$|During {{the whole}} of that meal I felt certain there was a secret, mysterious {{communication}} between me and Mary Warren, which, while <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> escape the notice of others, was perfectly evident to ourselves. This fact I felt to be true; while there was a consciousness betrayed in Mary's blushes, and even in her averted eyes, that I found extremely eloquent on the same subject.|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} mail with your letter, arrived the {{enclosed}} from Orme the motor man. You will observe {{that he has}} an office. I will explain {{that this is a}} law office and I think <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man to have one with an active business attached. You see he is on the electric light lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if I want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me, to hire him on a good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same old eagerness, the same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will escape him? Now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities, going on week after week with this same man, during fifty entire years, and he has not yet learned, in the slightest degree, that there isn't any occasion to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always wait; and that whether it waits or flies, he certainly will never catch it. This immortal hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment, is the immortal feature of this character, for a play; and we will write that play. We should be fools else. That staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent, for it is slung on the paper telegraphically, all the small words left out. I am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit. Save this letter for an inspiration. I have got a hundred more.|$|E
6000|$|The {{philosophy}} imputed {{to him in}} {{that beautiful}} outbreak, the hour there, amid such happy provision, striking for him, would have been then, on behalf of my man of imagination, to be logically and, as the artless craft of comedy has it, [...] "led up" [...] to; the probable course to such a goal, the goal of so conscious a predicament, would have in short to be finely calculated. Where has he come from and why has he come, {{what is he doing}} (as we Anglo-Saxons, and we only, say, in our foredoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression) in that galere? To answer these questions plausibly, to answer them as under cross-examination in the witness-box by counsel for the prosecution, in other words satisfactorily to account for Strether and for his [...] "peculiar tone," [...] was to possess myself of the entire fabric. At the same time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle of probability: he wouldn't have indulged in his peculiar tone without a reason; it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give him so ironic an accent. One hadn't been noting [...] "tones" [...] all one's life without recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position. The dear man in the Paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably IN one--which was no small point gained; what next accordingly concerned us was the determination of THIS identity. One could only go by probabilities, but there was the advantage that the most general of the probabilities were virtual certainties. Possessed of our friend's nationality, to start with, there was a general probability in his narrower localism; which, for that matter, one had really but to keep under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets. He would have issued, our rueful worthy, from the very heart of New England--at the heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled for me into the light. They had to be sifted and sorted, and I shall not reproduce the detail of that process; but unmistakeably they were all there, and it was but a question, auspiciously, of picking among them. What the [...] "position" [...] would infallibly be, and why, on his hands, it had turned [...] "false"--these inductive steps could only be as rapid as they were distinct. I accounted for everything--and [...] "everything" [...] had by this time become the most promising quantity--by the view that he had come to Paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing, as a result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions, a change almost from hour to hour. He had come with a view that might have been figured by a clear green liquid, say, in a neat glass phial; and the liquid, once poured into the open cup of APPLICATION, once exposed to the action of another air, had begun to turn from green to red, or whatever, and might, for all he knew, be on its way to purple, to black, to yellow. At the still wilder extremes represented perhaps, for all he could say to the contrary, by a variability so violent, he would at first, naturally, but have gazed in surprise and alarm; whereby the SITUATION clearly would spring from the play of wildness and the development of extremes. I saw in a moment that, should this development proceed both with force and logic, my [...] "story" [...] would leave nothing to be desired. There is always, of course, for the story-teller, the irresistible determinant and the incalculable advantage of his interest in the story AS SUCH; it is ever, obviously, overwhelmingly, the prime and precious thing (as other than this I {{have never been able to}} see it); as to which what makes for it, with whatever headlong energy, may be said to pale before the energy with which it simply makes for itself. It rejoices, none the less, at its best, to seem to offer itself in a light, to seem to know, and with the very last knowledge, what it's about--liable as it yet is at moments to be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no warrant but its splendid impudence. Let us grant then that the impudence is always there--there, so to speak, for grace and effect and ALLURE; there, above all, because the Story is just the spoiled child of art, and because, as we are always disappointed when the pampered don't [...] "play up," [...] we like it, to that extent, to look all its character. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> so, in truth, even when we most flatter ourselves that we negotiate with it by treaty.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{provides}} additional benefits relative to existing treatments, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not precisely mimic {{the mechanism of}} an existing known treatment.|$|E
50|$|At least VC 4 (e.g. in the Raspberry Pi) {{does not}} support S3 Texture Compression (S3TC). <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> also <b>does</b> not support Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC).|$|R
50|$|It breeds across Arctic Europe and Asia and in Canada and {{the northernmost}} United States. It is migratory, {{wintering}} in the Russian steppes, the southern United States, Northern Scandinavian arctic areas {{and down to}} coastal Southern Sweden, Denmark and Great Britain. This is the only Eurasian species of the longspur buntings, and while <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not evolve there, it has been present in Eastern Europe for at least about 30,000 years.|$|R
50|$|Wilstein, {{in several}} columns, criticized the weak early testing by baseball. “Baseball may think it’s {{satisfying}} Congress and fooling {{the public with}} its drug-testing plan, but <b>it’s</b> <b>probably</b> <b>doing</b> neither,” Wilstein wrote on August 27, 2002 as the sport shaped its first stab at testing _ anonymous and without punishments. “More than likely, it will result in greater drug use, not less, as players figure out how and when they can take steroids and beat the tests.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the poem}} is lost. Only {{fragments}} of it are preserved in Skáldskaparmál and in Heimskringla. In Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum a Latin translation {{of the poem}} is found but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not closely follow the original.|$|E
50|$|The First Swedish Crusade {{is purely}} legendary and {{according}} to most historians today never took place {{as described in the}} legend and did not result in any ties between Finland and Sweden. For the most part, it was made up in the late 13th century to date the Swedish rule in Finland further back in time. No historical record has also survived describing the second one, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> take place and ended up in the concrete conquest of southwestern Finland.|$|R
5000|$|The Romney {{campaign}} subsequently defended ORCA as a success, though campaign officials {{admitted that}} the system [...] "had its challenges". Conservative activists and writers blamed ORCA for depressing Republican turnout on election day. While political scientists have rebutted these claims, suggested that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not have a decisive effect on the outcome, it may have negatively affected turnout figures. ORCA has been compared unfavorably with a [...] "get out the vote" [...] and data effort from President Obama, including Project Narwhal, seen as more robust.|$|R
5000|$|She {{trained with}} Christoph Poppen and Dénes Zsigmondy. After winning the Paganini Competition, and keen to broaden her experience, {{she moved in}} 1996 to Paris where she lived for the next nine years. [...] It was in France that her first CD appeared, {{featuring}} music by Bartok. She attracted plaudits as an interpreter of Fauré.

50|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> {{not belong}} to Katla, but feeds from its own source of magma.

50|$|The dot-winged crake (Porzana spiloptera) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae. Despite its visual similarities, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> {{not belong to the}} genus Porzana; like the Yellow-breasted crake, which was {{variously}} placed in Hapalocrex, Micropygia, Poliolimnas or Porzana, it seems to form a badly-resolved complex with the mainly Neotropical crakes of genera Anurolimnas, Coturnicops and Laterallus.|$|E
5000|$|The modius {{is a type}} of flat-topped {{cylindrical}} headdress or crown {{found in}} ancient Egyptian art and art of the Greco-Roman world. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a Roman unit of dry measure, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not form {{where it is}} found today. Because of the {{decreased}} gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|R
50|$|Heterodonty {{is known}} in several sphenosuchians, {{including}} Dibothrosuchus, Hesperosuchus, Pedeticosaurus, and Sphenosuchus. These forms had similar divisions of pointed and recurved anterior teeth and less pointed middle and posterior teeth, {{which could have been}} the ancestral state for the leaf-shaped teeth of Phyllodontosuchus. Small heterodont crocodylomorphs are known from other lineages as well, including Edentosuchus, Chimaerasuchus, and Malawisuchus. These small, variably-toothed crocodylomorphs are thought to have had diets beyond the typical carnivory/piscivory of modern crocodilians, possibly including some degree of herbivory. If Phyllodontosuchus <b>did</b> eat plants, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not grind them in the jaws, though.|$|R
