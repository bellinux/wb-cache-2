5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron.

Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which <b>he</b> <b>answers</b> an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{picks up}} {{at the press conference}} {{immediately}} where last season's cliff-hanger (Two Cathedrals) left off, and what was then only implicit is here made clear: President Bartlet is running for a second term. When asked if he plans to seek re-election, <b>he</b> <b>answers</b> [...] "Yeah, and I'm gonna win." [...] From that point on the story develops in dual storylines, one following immediately upon the press conference, the other taking place four weeks later, as the staff is preparing for the official campaign announcement in Manchester, New Hampshire.|$|E

The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, [...] "Later, Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad". After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, <b>he</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] "Just because". Later, Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people that going to war was correct because <b>he</b> <b>answers</b> to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|E
