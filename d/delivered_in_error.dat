50|$|When Kat stops paying Stacey's rent, Martin sets {{up his own}} {{market stall}} but some of his {{merchandise}} is faulty and he is forced to issue refunds, though is unable to get a refund himself. Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) assists Martin by getting him some work in Sunderland for two weeks. Martin accepts this, but when he returns, Stacey is underwhelmed with the funds he has collected; he insists more is being transferred soon. Andy later tells Martin he knows he was fired from the job and is lying to Stacey. Andy tells Stacey, so Martin explains that he was underqualified for the position. Martin asks Andy for more work, so Andy says that 40 toilets were <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>error</b> to the flats he is renovating and they could sell them and split the profits. Martin agrees and with Stacey and Kyle's help, they successfully steal them. When Stacey learns her cousin Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) is trying to sell them back to Jack, Martin, Stacey, Kyle and Belinda put them back. Following Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) death, Stacey tells Martin she cannot get married, but she changes her mind. Martin and Stacey marry at the registry office. When Sonia moves away, Bex moves in with Martin and Stacey and the family then move into Sonia's old house, but Kyle and Belinda then both move away. Later, Martin is furious when he finds out that Bex's boyfriend and Kush's younger brother, Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) has ended his relationship with Bex immediately after having sex with her. He attacks Shakil {{in the market and}} announces his actions to everyone but this humilates Bex. He apologises to Bex and Stacey and later comforts Bex.|$|E

40|$|The {{next-generation}} cellular wireless networks {{will support}} high data rates and provide {{quality of service}} (QoS) for multimedia applications with increased network capacity. Under limited frequency resources, the conventional approach to increase network capacity is to install more base stations (BSs) to exploit spatial reuse. This solution is not very eﬃcient because {{the cost of the}} BS transceiver is quite high. An alterna- tive approach is to employ relay stations (RSs) as intermediate nodes to establish multihop communication paths between mobile hosts and their corresponding BSs. Multihop cellular networks (MCN) can potentially enhance coverage, data rates, QoS performance in terms of call block- ing probability, bit error rate, as well as QoS fairness for diﬀerent users. A number of diﬀerent architectures, protocols, and analytical models for MCNs have been proposed in the literature where diﬀerent system aspects were investigated. This thesis aims to present strategies of re- source allocation (RA) and path selection (PS) for cognitive radio (CR) multi-hop communications over a packet-oriented and bit-interleaved- coded OFDM transmission, employing practical modulation and coding schemes. As a promising technology, cognitive radio can be leveraged by the cellular network to increase the overall spectral efciency by allowing additional users in an already crowded spectrum. Here, we assume that a secondary transmitter (ST) adapt his parameters for transmitting to a secondary receiver (SR) or to a relay, over sections of spectrum owned by licensed or primary users (PUs), without harming the quality of service of the latter. This approach is known as underlay. The performance of the system are evaluated in terms of goodput (GP), which is deﬁned as the number of information bits <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>error</b> free packets per unit of time. It is able to quantify the trade-oﬀ between data rate and link reliability, and it is a more suitable metric to quantify the actual perfor- mance of packet-oriented systems, employing practical modulation and coding schemes, respect to the capacity for example. A generic trans- mitter of the network is able to optimize the GP by a proper selection of the transmission parameters, if the channel state information (CSI) are perfect. In most wireless networks, because of channel estimation errors and channel feedback delay, this CSI will not be perfect there- fore any transmitting node only has outdated and imperfect CSI and the channel prediction and as a consequence, a predicted GP (PGP), will be optimized. GP depends on PER that is not easy to calculate for a multi-carrier system and so will be use kESM technique. From here a Local-RA (L-RA) technique and a Sub-Optimal PS (Sub-PS) strategies are formulated for non-cooperative CR multi-hop communications, ex- ploiting xed decode-and-forward (DF) relay nodes (RNs). With these strategies we are able to reduce the signaling over the feedback channel and the computational complexity, compared to the Optimal-RA with Optimal-PS method, paying a very little reduction of GP. Finally we will evaluate whether the increase of the number of relays corresponds to a performance increase...|$|E

30|$|The use of IP {{networks}} for video delivery is gaining an increasing popularity as {{a mean of}} broadcasting data from content providers to consumers. Video transmission over peer-to-peer networks is also becoming very popular. Typically, these networks provide only best-effort services, that is, {{there is no guarantee}} that the content will be <b>delivered</b> without <b>errors.</b> <b>In</b> practice, the received video sequence may be a degraded version of the original. Besides distortions introduced by lossy coding, user's experience might be also affected by channel-induced distortions. Thus, the design of systems for automatic monitoring of the received video quality is of great interest for service providers, in order to optimize the transmission strategies as well as to ensure a desired level of quality of experience. Several algorithms, usually referred to as objective quality metrics, have been proposed in the literature for the in-service objective quality evaluation of video sequences. They consist of No-Reference or Reduced-Reference methods relying on the analysis of the bitstream, the pixels, or both (so-called hybrid approach) [1, 2]. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available databases of video sequences and subjective scores makes the comparison of existing and novel solutions very difficult.|$|R
