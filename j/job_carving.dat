Davis grew up painting, sculpting and drawing. He continued to pursue these crafts his entire life, supplementing his income with design commissions and art sales. On the DVD commentary track for Stargate SG-1 season 6 episode 17 ("Disclosure"), Davis said that he once had a <b>job</b> <b>carving</b> wooden cigar store Indians that were sold at Silver Dollar City.

40|$|Excerpt] Supported {{employment}} {{has been}} a service option {{for a long time}} and is responsible for many individuals working who were previously considered unemployable. It is characterized by competitive employment in community businesses with training and support provided by a skilled job coach for as long as the individual is employed. Supported employment is for those individuals who need help finding a job, intensive support to learn the job, and on-going follow-along support in order to keep their job. It is based on the premise that individuals do no have to “get ready ” for work but rather receive the necessary supports that bridge the gap between their skills and the job requirements once they are employed. Job coach assistance is provided more intensely at first followed by intermittent on-going support once that individual is able to complete the job. Examples of some of the supports that may help someone perform their job are: advocacy, natural supports, assistive technology, job modifications, <b>job</b> <b>carving,</b> rehabilitation engineering, compensatory strategies, and behavioral training techniques...|$|E

40|$|Workers in {{small-scale}} {{wood industries}} (SSWI) have increased risks of developing asthma and other respiratory diseases. Wood dust and microbial agents {{have both been}} suggested to play a role, but few studies have measured endotoxin exposure in SSWI in Africa. We assessed inhalable dust levels in 281 samples from 115 workers and bacterial endotoxins levels in 157 samples from 136 workers from SSWI in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The overall geometric mean of personal exposure was 3. 3 mg/m(3); geometric standard deviation (GSD) 2. 5; range 0. 45 - 67. 0 mg/m(3)) and 91 EU/m(3) (GSD 3. 7; range 9 - 4914. 8 EU/m(3)) for wood dust and endotoxins, respectively. Dust and endotoxin levels were weakly correlated (r = 0. 44, n = 157, P < 0. 0001). Between- and within-worker variances and percentages explained by the differences among job titles and seasons were 0. 31 (9 %) and 0. 35 (30 %), respectively, for wood dust exposure, and 0. 35 (0 %) and 0. 35 (38 %) for endotoxin exposure. Higher dust and endotoxin exposure levels were observed in the dry compared to the wet season, after correcting for differences in exposure between <b>jobs.</b> <b>Carving</b> and manual cleaning {{were associated with the}} highest dust exposures. Sewing seat covers and manual cleaning were associated with the highest endotoxin exposures. Dust and endotoxin exposure levels in SSWI are high and appropriate control measures are necessary...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three papers {{on a handful of}} related metaphysical and metametaphysical topics. The first examines the connection between analyticity and ontology. Some hold that we can trivially resolve longstanding ontological debates by appealing to "ampliative" analytic truths (e. g. 'if Socrates is wise, then wisdom is characteristic of Socrates'). I argue that once we clarify the theoretical role that analyticity needs to play for this view, it turns out that analyticity is ill-suited to play it; rather, what is motivating these theorists is a distinctive sort of equivalence claim - for instance, that 'Socrates is wise' and 'wisdom is characteristic of Socrates' merely provide different means of describing the same fact. I go on to argue that equivalencies of this sort are independent of controversial claims about analyticity, and threaten to hold important consequences for ontological inquiry. The second paper explores the metaphysical underpinnings of this type of equivalence claim. Part of the project is to clarify the content and consequences of such claims, and part is to canvass some motivations for accepting them; but the main goal is to explore two importantly ways of understanding their metametaphysical import. Briefly, one such view allows that 'Socrates is wise' and 'Socrates instantiates wisdom' can describe the same fact, but goes on to suggest that one of these sentences does a better <b>job</b> of <b>carving</b> that fact at its metaphysical joints. Another denies that such distinctions in joint-carvingness can be drawn (these sentences merely provide different means of "carving up" that fact). Although both views face serious challenges, I ultimately recommend the latter. The third paper develops a positive account of this equivalence relation. In contrast to one prominent view found in the literature, according to which this relation is cashed out in terms of a coarse-grained relation of necessary or truthconditional equivalence, I recommend a fine-grained alternative, motivated by way of some traditional assumptions about the connection between facts and truthbearers. I go on to discuss several metaphysical and metametaphysical consequences of this position. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Natural Categories and Human Kinds is {{a recent}} and timely {{contribution}} to current debate on natural kinds. Because of the growing sophistication of this debate, {{it is necessary to}} make careful distinctions in order to appreciate the originality of Khalidi’s position. Khalidi’s view on natural kinds is naturalistic: if {{we want to know what}} Nature’s joints really are, we should look at the actual <b>carving</b> <b>job</b> carried out by our best scientific practices. Like LaPorte, Khalidi is a fallibilist: our best scientific theories may be revised or abandoned and so can our current classifications of natural kinds. Unlike LaPorte, however, Khalidi is an anti-essentialist: he argues against the idea that membership in a natural kind is a matter of possessing an essential set of necessary and sufficient properties. Like Dupré, Khalidi is a pluralist and anti-reductionist: he does not believe that there is only one true classification system and that there are natural kinds only at the so-called "fundamental level" of microphysics. Khalidi develops his pluralistic and anti-reductionistic position on the basis of a deep appreciation for the special sciences but, unlike Dupré, he thinks that only the scientific inquiry, which is driven by epistemic purposes, discover natural kinds and that, therefore, there are important differences between scientific and folk classifications. Khalidi’s conception of natural kinds has both an epistemic and a metaphysical component...|$|R
50|$|An {{impotent}} middle-aged Brahman {{king had}} {{a young and}} very beautiful queen who was a Brahman, too, and lived in the palace under cultural confinements. She was a devotee of Goddess Durga. The king thought of getting a temple constructed within the palace for the queen to worship. Perumthachan was called for, and was entrusted with the <b>job.</b> During construction <b>carving</b> the sculpture of the goddess {{was the most important}} item and further more important was its face. Perumthachan tried to carve the face numerous times on other stones to practice so that he would not spoil the main piece, but was dissatisfied. This was happening {{for the first time with}} him. The fact was that the queen used to peep through one of her windows at him and he himself was aware of this. Hence, whenever he started to work on the face his mind would imagine a blank face because he could not see the queen’s beautiful face. One day the queen, without the knowledge of the king, came to supervise the work and was surprised that the face was blank. Perumthachan told the queen the fact and then the queen agreed to sit with him to model her face for the idol but the condition was that the king should not know and she would call him late night to her private room at the appropriate time. Once during the king’s official visit to far off places in his regime the queen signaled Perumthachan as agreed and next few nights were their private nights. The princess was the outcome of this secret relation which was known to one of his assistants and one of the queen’s maids. When the king returned and came to check if the idol’s face was carved, he was surprised to see that face was still covered (though it was fully carved). But, to cover-up, Perumthachan took official permission from the king to get the sight of the queen’s face just once so that he could finish the face. The king permitted him to see the queen’s face one time, just one time in his presence.|$|R
