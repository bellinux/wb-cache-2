5|$|In 1986, {{the company}} {{established}} a <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop</b> at Torp. By 1987, Norsk Air was losing NOK20 million per year. The company established a route from Sandefjord to Göteborg Landvetter Airport and to London Stansted Airport, but neither were profitable, and were quickly terminated. Norsk Air started a route from Fagernes Airport, Leirin to Oslo and Bergen on 4 November 1987. The route {{turned out to}} be unprofitable, and was terminated on 1 June 1988, after the company had lost NOK 5 million on the route.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} buildings, the {{terminal}} building, and the combined building for airport operations, e.g. air traffic control, rescue services, etc. In addition there are some smaller buildings. The terminal building has a café, a gift shop, a <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop</b> and a restaurant.|$|E

25|$|Vildanden {{introduced}} a daily service to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen on 26 February 2007. They never reached their target ridership and terminated the route in November. With {{the completion of}} Nyhamna in the summer, ridership at the airport began to fall, dropping by 110,000 in 2008. Ving and Star Tour introduced winter IT charters to Las Palmas from October. This spurred {{the need for a}} larger terminal, with construction starting in March 2008. When completed, it could handle a full 180-seat Boeing 737-800 at both the domestic and international sections simultaneously. It also featured a <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{passengers}} {{traveling on}} international flight must {{pass through the}} <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop</b> {{in order to get}} to their flight. There is a possibility for some passengers (for example, those allergic to perfume) to ask security to use a narrow corridor which bypasses the shop. Nonetheless, the layout has been criticized by teetotalist organizations. The airport's response is that the layout was needed due to the terminal's small size. The shop has also been criticized for informing passengers who purchase less than their permitted tax-free quota of alcohol that they are allowed to purchase more. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs indicated that this may violate the ban on alcohol advertising.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{authorized}} on July 24, 2011, before advanced planning had been completed. The project will cost NIS 1.95 billion {{and will be}} funded partly by real estate revenue from selling the Eilat Airport's land. The planning budget, approved on May6, 2010, is NIS 56million. There was a plan to make the airport a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, but the Israel Airports Authority (IAA) objected, and the government authorized it to plan and oversee the project. Despite this, {{it is estimated that}} if the IAA takes on the funding completely on its own, it will go bankrupt and default on its debts. Danya Cebus will build the passenger terminal. The terminal is set to feature a <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop,</b> a feature which was not present in Eilat Airport. Mer Group will provide command and control for the airport, including CCTV and perimeter protection.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the {{government}} of Thaksin Shinawatra granted King Power the right to operate <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops</b> at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's new main airport, for 10 years.

25|$|Terminal B {{original}} completed {{construction in}} 2005, {{with the total}} area of 15,400 m² and the capacity of 600 pax/hour. On June 15, 2009, a larger, 45,000 m² international terminal completed construction {{in time for the}} BRICS summit, and took the role of Terminal B. The original one was merged with the domestic terminal. Terminal B has a capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal consists of 2 floors and is conjoined to Terminal A. The ground floor houses the check-in desks, a baggage claim area with the baggage carousels, customs control and several retail stores. On the second floor there stand the security control, international business lounge, a <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop,</b> a smoking room and several retail shops. General renovations were made alongside the domestic renovation project. The business terminal was renovated as recent as February 2014.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a jetty {{dedicated}} to all U.S. bound flights, which holds 18 gates: 72 through 89. For access to gate 87, 88 or 89, passengers must go down one level via an escalator. Gate 56, 58 and 60 (part of the international jetty) {{can also be used}} for a U.S. bound flight. They can be isolated from the other gates by moving glass walls known as swing gates. Unlike other jetties, the transborder jetty requires passengers to go through security checkpoint C and then the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and lastly through the <b>duty-free</b> <b>shop</b> before accessing their gates. The gate area contains the same services as the other parts of the airport such as shops, restaurants, rest zones and cafés. If needed, some gates can be isolated in order to offer additional security checkpoints if an aircraft flies to a potential risk zone like Washington–National.|$|E
