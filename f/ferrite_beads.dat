50|$|A {{ferrite bead}} or ferrite choke is a passive {{electric}} component that suppresses {{high frequency noise}} in electronic circuits. It is {{a specific type of}} electronic choke. <b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> employ high frequency current dissipation in a ferrite ceramic to build high frequency noise suppression devices. <b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> may also be called blocks, cores, rings, EMI filters, or chokes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.|$|E
50|$|Lossy <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> {{may also}} be used to isolate or 'island' {{sections}} of circuitry. These add a high series impedance (in contrast to the low parallel impedance added by decoupling capacitors) to the power supply rails, preventing high-frequency currents being drawn from elsewhere in the system.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the small}} {{dimensions}} of SMDs, SMT inductors are limited to values of less than about 10 mH. Smaller inductance with moderately high current ratings are usually of the <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> type. They are simply a metal conductor looped through a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> and almost {{the same as their}} through-hole versions but possess SMD end caps rather than leads. They appear dark grey and are magnetic, unlike capacitors with a similar dark grey appearance. These <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> type are limited to small values in the nH (nano Henry), range and are often used as power supply rail decouplers or in high frequency parts of a circuit. Larger inductors and transformers may of course be through-hole mounted on the same board.|$|R

50|$|Surface-mount <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> are available. These are {{soldered}} into {{a gap in}} {{the printed}} circuit board trace, just like any other surface mount inductor. Inside the bead component, a coil of wire runs between layers of ferrite to form a multi-turn inductor around the high permeability core.|$|E
5000|$|To reduce low-frequency {{reflections}} {{from the}} fuselage and vertical stabilizer, wires were strung horizontally from {{the nose of}} the aircraft to the tail, and horizontally from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer. <b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> were placed on the wires to tune them to the expected frequencies. This technique was called simply, [...] "Wires." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> {{are used}} as {{inductors}} to form a passive low-pass filter. The geometry and electromagnetic properties of coiled wire over the ferrite bead result in an impedance for high-frequency signals, attenuating high frequency EMI/RFI electronic noise. The energy is either reflected back up the cable, or dissipated as low level heat. Only in extreme cases is the heat noticeable.|$|E
5000|$|Cables for {{connection}} of computer peripherals {{often have a}} <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead.</b> The cable {{can be used to}} increase the inductance also repeatedly passed through a ferrite core.|$|R
50|$|High-frequency {{signal lines}} may {{attenuate}} or prevent sheath currents using a sheath current filter which {{is applied to}} a coaxial cable {{in or near the}} device. In the simplest case, this is a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead,</b> it includes the coaxial inner and outer conductor and acts as a common-mode choke. At the same time, a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> has a transformer effect, so that a useful signal is confirmed as differential-mode. To increase the inductance compared to the unwanted common mode signal component, the cable can also be repeatedly passed through or wound around the bead.|$|R
50|$|A modern form of choke {{used for}} {{eliminating}} digital RF noise from lines is the <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead,</b> a cylindrical or torus-shaped core of ferrite slipped over a wire. These are often seen on computer cables. A typical RF choke value could be 2 millihenries.|$|R
50|$|All {{equipment}} using RF electronics {{should be}} inside a screened conductive box and all connections {{in or out}} of the box should be filtered to avoid the passage of radio signals. A common and effective method of doing so for wires carrying DC supplies, 50/60 Hz AC connections, audio and control signals is to use a feedthrough capacitor, whose job is to short circuit any RF on the wire to ground. The use of <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> is also common.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> prevent {{interference}} in two directions: from a device or to a device. A conductive cable {{acts as an}} antenna - if the device produces radio frequency energy, this can be transmitted through the cable, which acts as an unintentional radiator. In this case the bead is required for regulatory compliance, to reduce EMI. Conversely, if there are other sources of EMI, such as household appliances, the bead prevents the cable from acting as an antenna and receiving interference from these other devices. This is particularly common on data cables and on medical equipment.|$|E

50|$|A {{design that}} uses a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> to improve noise {{filtering}} {{must take into account}} specific circuit characteristics and the frequency range to block. Different ferrite materials have different properties with respect to frequency, and manufacturer's literature helps select the most effective material for the frequency range.|$|R

The small rectangular chips {{with numbers}} are resistors, while the unmarked small rectangular chips are capacitors.

50|$|Ferrite cores {{are used}} in {{electronic}} inductors, transformers, and electromagnets where the high electrical resistance of the ferrite leads to very low eddy current losses. They are commonly seen as a lump in a computer cable, called a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead,</b> which helps to prevent high frequency electrical noise (radio frequency interference) from exiting or entering the equipment.|$|R
50|$|Passive {{measurement}} of an electrically small antenna requires a quarter-wavelength RF choke or ferrite bead {{to be added}} to the end of the feeding coaxial cable to limit or prevent the current from flowing onto the surface of the cable. Current flowing on the exterior of the feeding cable increases the electrical size and radiation aperture of the antenna, resulting in erroneous measurement result. The quarter-wavelength choke are narrow-band and the <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> are lossy at higher frequency greater than 1 GHz. These techniques are not without problems; the quarter-wavelength choke technique allows currents to travel up to 0.25 wavelengths from the antenna and increases the effective size, whereas the lossy choke (e.g. ferrite bead) technique introduces losses that should be considered.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} effect of <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> on the audio quality of Class-D audio amplifiers. This latter is a switch-ing circuit which creates high {{frequency}} harmonics. Generally, a filter is used at the amplifier output {{for the sake of}} electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC). So often, in integrated solutions, this filter contains <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> which are magnetic components and present nonlinear behavior. Time domain measurements and their equivalence in frequency domain are presented. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measurements according to the audio signal frequency and amplitude are exposed and discussed. It is shown that <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> introduce up to 30 dB of additional THD which prove the negative effect of the ferrite bead on the amplifier audio quality...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for designing baluns exhibiting multi-decade bandwidths at microwave frequencies. Simulations show that resistors terminating the outer transmission line suppress the half-wavelength resonance and greatly extend the bandwidth. Using linear measurements at microwave frequencies, <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> {{have been shown}} to behave as resistors with a small reactance, suitable for terminating the outer transmission line. This paper shows that <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> can perform the dual role of improving magnetic coupling at low frequency and suppressing resonance at higher frequencies. The design methodology was applied to produce a balun that operates between 30 MHz and 6 GHz, displays less than 1 dB of power loss up to 4. 4 GHz, and delivers an impedance transformation of 2 : 1...|$|E
50|$|In {{circuits}} producing {{high frequency}} noise such as computer components, <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> chokes are placed around cables just before the termination to the next appliance (e.g., the computer). These present a high impedance only at high frequency, so they will effectively stop radio frequency and digital noise, but will have little effect on 50/60 Hz noise.|$|R
5000|$|Dark grey colour {{indicates}} a capacitance in the Î¼F range, generally 0.5 to 50 Î¼F, or the device {{may be an}} inductor and the dark grey {{is the color of}} the <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead.</b> (An inductor will measure a low resistance to a multimeter on the resistance range whereas a capacitor, out of the circuit, will measure a near infinite resistance.) ...|$|R
50|$|Common mode {{filtering}} {{may also}} be used to prevent egress of noise for electromagnetic compatibility purposes. High frequency common mode signals, for example, RF noise from a computing circuit, may be blocked using a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> clamped to the outside of a cable. These are often observable on laptop computer power supplies near the jack socket, and good quality mouse or printer USB cables and HDMI cables.|$|R
40|$|International audienceClass-D audio {{amplifiers}} are switching circuits that produce serious Electromagnetic (EM) emissions and disturb the surrounding electronics. In {{order to reduce}} these emissions, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) filters with <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> are used. However, <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> contain magnetic materials that have a nonlinear behavior. Thus, they have an unfavorable impact on the system audio quality. The common ferrite bead models do {{not take into account}} nonlinear phenomena. Thus, to predict the impact on the signal quality, this paper models the ferrite bead using the Jilesâ€“Atherton magnetic material theory. The presented model provides the designers with a tool to quantify the effect of EMC filters on the total harmonic distortion (THD) of {{audio amplifiers}}. The simulated and measured results show that the tested ferrite bead {{have a negative effect on}} the audio signal for a wide range of amplitudes and can increase the THD up to 37 dB. Finally, this paper highlights the impact of the magnetic material type on the audio distortion by simulating the same component with different types of materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} {{approach for}} lumped-parameter circuit modeling of SMT <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> is introduced. Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) measurements are utilized {{to provide the}} frequency-dependent characteristics for SPICE analysis. The measured data is imported into the simulation environment via Analog Behavioral Models (ABM) accounting for the frequency dependent behavior of the ferrite sheets. It demonstrates {{a significant departure from}} a simple R-L-C circuit network. Model accuracy is validated by realization of an ad hoc testboard and by experimental characterization of the component in terms of Insertion Loss...|$|E
40|$|Limiting {{resistors}} {{are currently}} {{required to be}} connected in series with tantalum capacitors {{to reduce the risk}} of surge current failures. However, application of limiting resistors decreases substantially the efficiency of the power supply systems. An ideal surge current limiting device should have a negligible resistance for DC currents and high resistance at frequencies corresponding to transients in tantalum capacitors. This work evaluates the possibility of using chip <b>ferrite</b> <b>beads</b> (FB) as such devices. Twelve types of small size FBs from three manufacturers were used to evaluate their robustness under soldering stresses and at high surge current spikes associated with transients in tantalum capacitors. Results show that FBs are capable to withstand current pulses that are substantially greater than the specified current limits. However, due to a sharp decrease of impedance with current, FBs do not reduce surge currents to the required level that can be achieved with regular resistors...|$|E
5000|$|For a {{cable bundle}} between two devices but {{grounded}} at only one device, in general a ferrite sheath current filter is not effective. With such an arrangement, a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> {{would only be}} effective to reduce sheath current standing waves. When used to eliminate standing waves, the ferrite sheath current filter must be placed at a current antinode, but not at standing wave nodes.|$|R
50|$|Bifilar coils impose an {{inductance}} in {{the common}} mode, but impose no inductance in the differential mode. Coils in such a combination are widely used to eliminate ingress or egress of common mode signals from electronic signalling circuits. This arrangement is used in transmission and reception magnetics of Ethernet cables and conspicuously {{in the form of}} a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead</b> clamped to the outside of USB, laptop power supply and HDMI cables.|$|R
50|$|On April 2, 1996, Sony {{released}} a {{revised version of}} the PlayStation Controller (model SCPH-1080), featuring a longer cord with a <b>ferrite</b> <b>bead.</b> After briefly selling the Dual Analog Controller in 1997, Sony began phasing out the PlayStation Controller later that year {{with the introduction of}} the DualShock controller, which would become the new standard controller for the PlayStation. The PlayStation 2 is backward-compatible with the original PlayStation controller.|$|R
