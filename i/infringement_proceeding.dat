DOI: 10. 1080 / 13600860902742588 In 2007 the European Commission {{finalised}} its proposals for replacing the Television without Frontiers Directive. The resultant Audiovisual Media Services Directive aims {{to provide a more}} suitable regulatory framework for the creative industries allowing it to benefit from the opportunities brought about by convergence. Convergence is the coming together of different technologies which have distinct functions to create one medium which performs each divergent function. The prime illustration of convergent technologies is arguably the coming together of telecommunications and broadcasting, through the internet and digital technology, so as to enable us to make voice telephony calls and watch television while sat at a computer. However, while convergence has created opportunities for the industry it has also created threats in that the same technology is also being used to infringe the copyright of content producers on a far greater scale. This is important as wide scale infringement may impact negatively on the creation of new works; as without protection from illegal copying the work has less economic value. It is argued that regardless of any other flaws the new Directive may have; its biggest weakness is not addressing the link between converged media platforms and the potential for increased copyright <b>infringement.</b> This work <b>proceeds</b> to evaluate whether the traditional approach to copyright protection is still the most suitable and whether in fact the arguments advanced in favour of this approach still have merit in the converged age. To this end an evaluation of a Creative Commons approach is provided in order to see whether this may have more advantages...|$|R
5000|$|This inherent-right {{doctrine}} was expressly {{rejected a}} few years later, however, in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. In that case, Justice Holmes (who {{had been in the}} majority in the A.B. Dick case), now in dissent, argued that because the owner of a patented teapot [...] "may keep his device wholly out of use [...] [...] [...] I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer" [...] will agree to buy his tea from the patent owner. But the majority rejected this doctrine of patentees' [...] "inherent rights." [...] It explained:The argument is that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding,</b> and rights which he may create for himself by private contract, which, however, are subject to the rules of general, as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute, and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted {{to the use of the}} invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the patent law which justifies as valid the restriction of patented machines, by notice, to use with unpatented supplies necessary {{in the operation of}} them, but which are no part of them, is believed to have originated in Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co. (which has come to be widely referred to as the Button-Fastener Case), decided by the [...] [...] [...] the Sixth Circuit in 1896.[...] [...] This decision Button-Fastener proceeds upon the argument that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding,</b> and rights which he may create for himself by private contract which, however, are subject to the rules of general as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, [...] [...] [...] he is thereby restricted {{to the use of the}} invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.The [...] [...] [...] obvious possibilities for gain in the method which it approved led to an immediate and widespread adoption of the system, in which these restrictions expanded into more and more comprehensive forms until at length the case at bar is reached, with a machine sold and paid for, yet claimed still to be subject not only to restriction as to supplies to be used, but also subject to any restrictions or conditions as to use [...] [...] [...] which the company which authorized its sale may see fit, after the sale, from time to time to impose. The perfect instrument of favoritism and oppression which such a system of doing business, if valid, would put into the control of the owner of such a patent should make courts astute, if need be, to defeat its operation. If these restrictions were sustained, plainly the plaintiff might, for its own profit or that of its favorites, [...] [...] [...] ruin anyone unfortunate enough to be dependent upon its confessedly important improvements for the doing of business.|$|E
5000|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{estimates}} that implementing H.R. 3309 would cost $3 {{million over the}} 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, mainly for reports to be prepared by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) and the Government Accountability Office and administrative costs incurred by the AOUSC associated with new judicial procedures. Pay-as-you-go procedures {{do not apply to}} this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. Based on information from the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the CBO also {{estimates that}} implementing H.R. 3309 would have a gross cost to the PTO of about $30 million per year. However, the PTO is authorized to collect fees sufficient to offset its operating expenses; therefore, the CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of PTO’s activities undertaken to implement H.R. 3309 would not be significant, assuming appropriation actions consistent with the agency’s authorities. H.R. 3309 would change administrative and judicial processes that support the protection of intellectual property rights. The CBO expects that, by requiring inventors to be more specific in pleadings to the court, awarding attorney fees to the prevailing party, and limiting discovery early in an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding,</b> the bill would affect the decisions of inventors to initiate lawsuits for patent infringement. [...] H.R. 3309 would make several adjustments to judicial procedures for patent infringement cases, including which parties may join a suit and when a court is required to grant a motion to stay an action. Further, the bill would require the courts to award the prevailing party reasonable fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such cases. The bill also would require the AOUSC to develop rules and procedures related to the discovery of evidence in lawsuits for patent infringement. [...] The bill would change procedures that the PTO has in place to examine patent applications, award patents, and determine the validity of a patent that has already been granted. Among other things, H.R. 3309 would specify that the agency use methods similar to those used in district courts to evaluate the validity of a patent. The bill also would require the agency to develop new databases to make information about patent ownership and litigation available on its website, perform an additional review of certain declarations made on original applications, and prepare several studies and reports on patent ownership and the behavior of certain patent owners. [...] H.R. 3309 would impose a mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) on both public and private entities because the PTO would charge fees to offset the costs incurred to collect and make some information related to patents publicly available. Other provisions in the bill also would result in increased patent fees. The requirement to pay those fees would be a mandate because the federal government controls the patent and trademark system, and no reasonable alternatives to that system exist. [...] Based on information from PTO, the CBO estimates that the annual cost to comply with the mandate would be about $30 million, with less than $1 million of those costs accruing to public entities and the rest accruing to private entities. Therefore, the cost for public and private entities to comply with the mandate would fall below the annual thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($75 million and $150 million in 2013, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a European <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding</b> against Spain, which {{was joined by}} other Member States in 2007, including Finland, the United Kingdom and Poland. The European Commission alleges {{a violation of the}} Second Company Law Directive through a discrimination of shareholders. It argues that Spanish companies are allowed to issue shares below the market value and exclude the pre-emption rights of the existing shareholders. Such share issues result in a wealth transfer from old to new shareholders (often referred to as a "dilution” of shareholdings), contrary to the equal treatment clause of the Second Directive. This article shows that the dispute is partly due to a misunderstanding of Spanish law, including legal culture. It also finds that the allegations have merit to some extent but crucially depend on the fact finding of the European Court of Justic...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the behavior of the European Commission in the infringement of proceedings based on article Article 258 et seq. TFEU. The paper seeks to look behind the borders of mere legal framework of <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding</b> and deals primarily with the political influences, which can affect the Commission's decision on how to act, as well as the theories, which try to explain and predict its reaction on the violation of Treaties by a Member State or different actors. The structure of the paper is as follows. Firstly, this thesis deals with the Commission's position in the system of the EU, with basic information about the Commission, then {{raises the question of whether}} the Commission is independent and impartial, or whether it is under some external or internal political pressures. Secondly, the thesis studies the infringement proceedings and the possibilities, procedures and tools available to the Commission to enforce the law and also how the Commission uses these options in practice. Of course, the paper will also cover the limits of this procedure. The Commission's main limitation of its ability to enforce the law is the lack of resources. This problem helps to resolve its discretion power. It can choose in which case of non-compliance to initiate the infingement [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Studies on EU {{policy-making}} generally {{disregard the}} key {{role played by}} the Commission as an enforcement agent responsible for the instigation and continuation of infringement cases. Furthermore, the Commission employs both amicable (‘management’) and coercive means (‘enforcement’) to induce compliance by member states, which are reflected in the different stages of the <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding.</b> In contrast to current research, this study incorporates the perspective of the Commission on non-compliance. Based on assumptions about the relation between the Commission and member states, it is assumed that different mechanisms drive the instigation of infringement proceedings and their escalation to later stages. Thus, it is predicted that conflict in the Council and member state low level of acceptance for EU policies increase the probability of instigating infringement cases. However, the same factors are expected to make escalations of infringements to ECJ referrals less likely, because the Commission dependence on the cooperation of member states. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset on the policy preferences of the Commission and 15 member states with regards to 18 EU directives. On the basis of multinomial logit and ordered logit regression analyses, I find evidence that there are differences between the effects on the instigation and the escalation of infringement cases...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that widespread uncertainty over the scopes of issued patents creates significant costs for third-party firms and may decrease innovation. This Article addresses the scope uncertainty issue from a theoretical perspective {{by creating a}} model of patent claim scope uncertainty. It is often difficult for third parties to determine the legal coverage of issued patents. Scope underdetermination exists when {{the words of a}} patent claim are capable of a broad range of plausible scopes ex ante in light of the procedures for interpreting patents. Underdetermination creates uncertainty about claim coverage because a lay interpreter cannot know which interpretation will ultimately be elected and employed by a judge or jury in a patent <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding.</b> This Article models this uncertainty problem by the set of interpretations that are plausible for a patent-claim element in light of constraints that restrict meaning, internal and external to the patent document. The model suggests generalizable properties against which we can critically evaluate patent interpretive rules and procedures. On this basis, the Article develops an approach to improving the ex ante scope precision of any given patent claim. The general approach is to reduce the set of interpretative scopes that patent claim words can plausibly obtain. By increasing explicit, scope-defining information in the public patent record, it is possible to improve scope precision by ex ante clarifying scope coverage and exclusion in foreseeable scope uncertainty scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Better {{regulation}} in the European Union cannot be achieved without serious attention to transposition of EU law into national legislation. As {{a matter of}} fact, EU member states breach EU law – perpetuately. Why do member states miss deadlines when transposing EU internal market directives? What factors determine delays when transposing EU directives? How do these factors influence the timeliness of the national transposition processes? And under what conditions are transpositions of directives delayed? This study analyses the timeliness of national transposition processes across nine member states of the 2004 EU transport acquis. Based on a truly mixed-method approach – a new quantitative data set with further insights gleaned from four controlled case studies and a concluding fuzzy set analysis - this study shows that the European Union has a serious transposition problem. Almost 70 percent of all national legal measures transposing the transport acquis cause problems, either because they are transposed too late, risking the opening of an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding,</b> or because they are too early (gold-plating), risking warping effects on the regulatory environment for business and citizens in the EU alike. Furthermore, this book provides some progress regarding {{the conditions under which}} transposition performance of member states could be improved. Seven potential European and national drivers and constrainers for timely transposition can be identified with different effects on the lengths of transposition delays. Distinguishing between three outcomes of transposition process (on time, short and long delay) it is the specific features of European directives that account for short term delays, whereas serious time lags of more than six months are a result of domestic factors. Furthermore, the timing of general elections in a member state and policy sector-related crises retard or rather accelerate national transposition processes just as political priority represents a significant necessary condition for timeliness.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the European directive on unfair commercial practices, its provisions started to apply alongside the existing sector-specific European legislation on consumer protection. With the aim of ensuring a coherent system of European consumer law, the directive stated that, in the case of conflict between its rules and other Community law regulating specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, the latter shall prevail and apply to those aspects. The directive, however, did not mandate any enforcement mechanism at the national level. The Italian legislation which implemented the European directive conferred a general enforcement power on unfair commercial practices to the national antitrust authority. Italian law was not, however, very clear regarding the competence of the agency in markets subject to the oversight of a different sector-specific authority. This issue was raised before the Italian administrative law Court which, at first, seemed to limit the general competence of the antitrust authority in fields where the contested practices were also considered by sector-specific regulation. For this reason, the European Commission started an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding</b> against Italy for not having correctly implemented the directive on unfair commercial practices. As a consequence, a recent reform in Italian law conferred the antitrust authority an exclusive competence to combat unfair commercial practices also in regulated sectors, after having consulted the sector-specific regulator, apart when the breach of sector-specific regulation does not result in an unfair commercial practice. After {{the adoption}} of this provision, the Italian administrative judge finally interpreted the law on unfair commercial practice consistently with the European directive. The Court denied that {{the adoption of}} secondary legislation by a national sector-specific regulators can exclude the application of the general provisions on unfair commercial practices and affirmed the relevant enforcement competence of the antitrust authority also in regulated sectors. In the light of these different approaches, this paper will attempt to examine the benefits and the drawbacks of the enforcement mechanisms endorsed by the Italian Courts and legislator. The aim of the work is to assess, from a legal perspective, which role should the general antitrust authority play in the enforcement of unfair commercial practices in markets subject to sector-specific regulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The general {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis is to analyse under what circumstances a Swedish court might adjudicate a cross-border trademark infringement case. Due to the recent technological developments (e. g. Internet) an underlying aim is to specifically identify so called Internet-related problems {{when it comes to}} ascertaining jurisdiction in cross-border cases. The study adopts a Swedish court perspective. The question raised, put simply, is whether the holder of a trademark could enforce the trademark right against a foreign defendant in a cross-border infringement case. The underlying question is if (and to what extent) foreign, as well as national, trademark infringements can be adjudicated in a Swedish court. The study is primarily concerned with registered national trademarks but Community Trademarks and unregistered trademarks are covered as well. The study begins with an analysis of the existing rules of private international law. It then proceeds with an examination of the relevant rules for ascertaining jurisdiction in cross-border cases. When the legal grounds for jurisdiction in a traditional (un-plugged) environment have been analysed the discussion then focuses on Internet-related problems. The following general conclusions were reached after analysing the questions raised. Firstly, the Internet-related problems in the area of cross-border trademark infringements are not as serious as first imagined. However, there are some problems of a general nature. These problems are related to the fact that actions and effect are not easy to demarcate on the Internet. As a consequence, jurisdictional rules based upon such grounds are difficult to adopt. In regards to this problem the study concludes {{that there is a need}} to amend the jurisdictional rules as they exist today. Secondly, the existing rules on exclusive jurisdiction when it comes to questions about registered intellectual property rights are in need of clarification. One of the main questions is whether or not a negative declaratory judgement could be regarded as concerned with the validity of a disputed intellectual property right. Another important question is whether or not questions about validity, raised as a defence during an <b>infringement</b> <b>proceeding,</b> should be handled as exclusive questions, or if it is possible to try such questions preliminarily. In this regard it was concluded that an action for a negative declaratory judgement might be regarded as a case covered by the applicability of the exclusive rules. It was also concluded that questions of validity, raised as a defence, might be tried by courts preliminarily, without conflicting with the exclusive rules on jurisdiction...|$|E
