40|$|This project explores a {{security}} framework, called the Persona Concept, aimed at giving the user {{greater control over}} their private data in cyberspace, in particular, their <b>electronic</b> <b>credentials.</b> The background for the Persona Concept, along with the requirements identified {{can be found in}} three (3) technical publications produced by Kal Toth and myself in 2003 (see list of references [1], [2] and [3]). The Persona Concept uses a Persona Server as the secure storehouse for persona data such as credit card and bank account identifiers as well <b>electronic</b> <b>credentials</b> such as X. 509 certificates. The data is secured using public key encryption. The server component interacts with the user via a Persona Client which obtains X- 509 Certificates on behalf of the user from a Certification Authority (CA) service. Interaction among the various components (Persona Server, Persona Client and Certification Authority) is enabled by the use of Web Services. This project focused on managing the user data across these components including the creation, secure storage and retrieval of Persona data to and from the Persona Server using Simple Object Application Protocol (SOAP) and under the control of public key encryption schemes. SOAP is an open XML-based application-level Internet protocol for implementing distributed access to object-oriented services deployed on the Web. SOAP is designed to allow applications running on a range of platforms to access remote objects and applications on servers across a TCP/IP network. In addition to this, the project built upon the work by Ike Chen (OSU M. S. graduate project in 2004) [4] by enabling X- 509 Certificate file transfer between the client and Certification Authority using SOAP (improvements were made to the mechanisms for transferring files, particularly in support of X. 509 certificates). A Java-based prototype client called the Persona Client (PC) was created and used in conjunction with a small local password-based security scheme to protect the private key data on the user device. My project first implemented the upgrade to the Certification Authority services and detailed the various policies surrounding storage of data. I then implemented the Persona Client which enabled me to test the persona services in place. I then implemented the encryption schemes and the server components enabling the secure storage and transfer of Persona Data. Components to create, edit and delete data were packaged and published as services to be used by the Persona Client. Future extensions of this project could include exploring custom credential generation based on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) which together can be used to specify XML-based credentials and access control policies for an enterprise. Other extensions include the implementation of discretionary and mandatory security policies using XACML to allow users to conduct transactions across various domains...|$|E

However, in today's globalized environment, it is becoming more common for citizens and entities of a given country, with their own <b>electronic</b> <b>credentials</b> under the legal framework of their country, to seek access to the public services provided by other countries with different legal frameworks and credentials. At present, a number of projects in the European Union are attempting to solve the problem through the use of pan-European identity management systems that ensure interoperability between the public institutions of different Member States. However, the solutions adopted to date are inadequate, for they do not envision all possible cases of user interaction with institutions.

40|$|Personal information, {{especially}} certified personal information, can be {{very valuable}} to its subject, {{but it can also}} be abused by other parties for identify theft, blackmail, fraud, and more. One partial solution to the problem is credentials, whereby personal information is tied to identity, for example by a photo or signature on a physical credential. We present an efficient scheme for large, redactable, digital credentials that allow certified personal attributes to safely be used to provide identification. A novel method is provided for combining credentials, even when they were originally issued by different authorities. Compared to other redactable digital credential schemes, the proposed scheme is approximately two orders of magnitude faster, due to aiming for auditability over anonymity. In order to expand this scheme to hold other records, medical records for example, we present a method for efficient signatures on redactable data where there are dependencies between different pieces of data. Positive results are shown using both artificial datasets and a dataset derived from a Linux package manager. <b>Electronic</b> <b>credentials</b> must of course be held in a physical device with electronic memory. To hedge against the loss or compromise of the physical device holding a user's credentials, the credentials may be split up. An architecture is developed and prototyped for using split-up credentials, with part of the credentials held by a network attached agent. This architecture is generalized into a framework for running identity agents with various capabilities. Finally, a system for securely sharing medical records is built upon the generalized agent framework. The medical records are optionally stored using the redactable digital credentials, for source verifiability. Ph. D.

40|$|In this thesis, we make {{contributions}} to secure and privacy preserving use of <b>electronic</b> <b>credentials</b> {{in three different}} levels. First, we address the case in credential systems where a credential owner wants to show her credential to a verifier without taking {{the risk that the}} ability to prove ownership of her credential is transferred to the verifier. We define credential ownership proof protocols for credentials signed by standard signature schemes. We also propose proper security definitions for the protocol, aiming to protect the security of both the credential issuer and the credential owner against concurrent attacks. We give two generic constructions of credential ownership proofs based on identity-based encryption and identity based identification schemes. Furthermore, we show that signatures with credential ownership proofs are equivalent to identity-based identification schemes, in the sense that any secure construction of each implies a secure construction of the other. Moreover, we show that the GQ identification protocol yields an efficient credential ownership proof for credentials signed by the RSA signature scheme and prove the protocol concurrently-secure. Then, we give a generic construction for universal (mutli) designated-verifier signature schemes from a large class of signature schemes, referred to as Class C. The resulting schemes are efficient and have two important properties. Firstly, they are provably DV-unforgeable, non-transferable and also non-delegatable. Secondly, the signer and the designated verifier can independently choose their cryptographic settings. We also propose a generic construction for (hierarchical) identity-based signature schemes from any signature scheme in C and prove that the construction is secure against adaptive chosen message and identity attacks. We discuss possible extensions of our constructions to identity-based ring signatures and identity-based designated-verifier signatures from any signature in C. Furthermore, we show {{that it is possible to}} combine the above constructions to obtain signatures with combined functionalities. Finally, inspired by the recent developments in attribute-based encryption, we propose threshold attribute-based signatures (t-ABS). In a t-ABS, signers are associated with a set of attributes and verification of a signed document against a verification attribute set succeeds if the signer has a threshold number of (at least t) attributes in common with the verification attribute set. A t-ABS scheme enables a signature holder to prove possession of signatures by revealing only the relevant (to the verification attribute set) attributes of the signer, hence providing signer-attribute privacy for the signature holder. We define t-ABS schemes, formalize their security and propose two t-ABS schemes: a basic scheme secure against selective forgery and a second one secure against existential forgery, both provable in the standard model, assuming hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. We show that our basic t-ABS scheme can be augmented with two extra protocols that are used for efficiently issuing and verifying t-ABS signatures on committed values. We call the augmented scheme a threshold attribute based c-signature scheme (t-ABCS). We show how a t-ABCS scheme can be used to realize a secure threshold attribute-based anonymous credential system (t-ABACS) providing signer-attribute privacy. We propose a security model for t-ABACS and give a concrete scheme using t-ABCS scheme. Using the simulation paradigm, we prove that the credential system is secure if the t-ABCS scheme is secure...|$|E

Federated Identity provides IdPs and relying parties with a common set of identity trust conventions that transcend individual identity service providers, users, or networks, so that a relying party will know it can trust a credential issued by IdP 'A' at a level of assurance comparable to a common standard, which will also be agreed upon by IdPs 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' ...|$|R

40|$|We {{envisage}} a fine-grained {{access control}} solution {{that allows a}} user's access privilege {{to be linked to}} the confidence level (hereafter referred to as the assurance level) in identifying the user. Such a solution would be particularly attractive to a large-scale distributed resource sharing environment, where resources {{are likely to be more}} diversified and may have varying levels of sensitivity and resource providers may wish to adjust security protection levels to adapt to resource sensitivity levels or risk levels in the underlying environment. However, existing electronic authentication systems largely identify users through the verification of their <b>electronic</b> identity (ID) <b>credentials.</b> They take into account neither assurance levels of the credentials, nor any other factors that may affect the assurance level of an authentication process, and this binary approach to access control may not provide cost-effective protection to resources with varying sensitivity levels. To realise the vision of assurance level linked access control, there is a need for an authentication framework that is able to capture the confidence level in identifying a user, expressed as an authentication Level of Assurance (LoA), and link this LoA value to authorisation decision-making. This research investigates the feasibility of estimating a user's LoA at run-time by designing, prototyping and evaluating an authentication model that derives an LoA value based upon not only users' ID credentials, but also other factors such as access location, system environment and authentication protocol used. To this aim, the thesis has identified and analysed authentication attributes, processes and procedures that may influence the assurance level of an authentication environment. It has examined various use-case scenarios of authentication in Grid environments (a well-known distributed system) and investigated the relationships among the attributes in these scenarios. It has then proposed an authentication model, namely a generic e-authentication LoA derivation model (GEA-LoADM). The GEA-LoADM takes into account multiple authentication attributes along with their relationships, abstracts the composite effect by the multiple attributes into a generic value called the authentication LoA, and provides algorithms for the run-time derivation of LoA values. The algorithms are tailored to reflect the relationships among the attributes involved in an authentication instance. The model has a number of valuable properties, including flexibility and extensibility; it can be applied to different application contexts and supports easy addition of new attributes and removal of obsolete ones. The prototypes of the algorithms and the model have been developed. The performance and security properties of the LoA derivation algorithms and the model are analysed here and evaluated based on the prototypes. The performance costs of the GEA-LoADM are also investigated and compared against conventional authentication mechanisms, and the security of the model is tested against various attack scenarios. A case study has also been conducted using a live system, the Multi-Agency Information Sharing (MAIS) system.
