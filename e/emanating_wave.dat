40|$|The {{action of}} the linear (in momenta) {{constraints}} on the configuration space (i. e. the space spanned by {{the components of the}} spatial metric with respect to some invariant basis) of a general Class A geometry is considered. It is proven that this action can also be seen, as being induced by a special subset of the spatial general coordinate transformations group (GCT) acting on the slices t=constant. The connecting link is provided by the automorphisms of the Lie algebra of the isometry group acting on the 3 -surfaces: let points 1, 2 in the configuration space, lying on an integral curve of a linear constraint, having coordinates γ^(1) _aβ, γ^(2) _aβ respectively; then it can be proven that these two (symmetric, positive definite) 3 × 3 matrices are always related through an element of the inner-automorphisms invariant subgroup of the automorphism group above mentioned, i. e. γ^(2) _μν=Λ^a_μΛ^β_νγ^(1) _aβ with Λ∈ IAut(G). Furthermore, it is also proven that the corresponding spatial line elements (constructed by these two hexads) are GCT related and thus geometrically identifiable. This explains why the quantum theory, groups together all these γ_aβs into the independent solutions of the linear constraints (i. e. Kuchař's physical variables). The consequences of the existence of these special GCTs both for the form of the classical action of all Bianchi Geometries, and the <b>emanating</b> <b>wave</b> functions, are also investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{adjustment}} to equilibrium by a stratified fluid in a rotating reference frame is a classical problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. We consider the fully nonlinear, stratified adjustment problem from a numerical point of view. We present results of smoothed dam break simulations based on experiments in the published literature, {{with a focus on}} both the wave trains that propagate away from the nascent geostrophic state and the geostrophic state itself. We demonstrate that for Rossby numbers in excess of roughly 2 the wave train cannot be interpreted in terms of linear theory. This wave train consists of a leading solitary-like packet and a trailing tail of dispersive waves. However, it is found that the leading wave packet never completely separates from the trailing tail. Somewhat surprisingly, the inertial oscillations associated with the geostrophic state exhibit evidence of nonlinearity even when the Rossby number falls below 1. We vary the width of the initial disturbance and the rotation rate so as to keep the Rossby number fixed, and find that while the qualitative response remains consistent, the Froude number varies, and these variations are manifested {{in the form of the}} <b>emanating</b> <b>wave</b> train. For wider initial disturbances we find clear evidence of a wave train that initially propagates toward the near wall, reflects, and propagates away from the geostrophic state behind the leading wave train. We compare kinetic energy inside and outside of the geostrophic state, finding that for long times a Rossby number of around one-quarter yields an equal split between the two, with lower (higher) Rossby numbers yielding more energy in the geostrophic state (wave train). Finally we compare the energetics of the geostrophic state as the Rossby number varies, finding long-lived inertial oscillations in the majority of the cases and a general agreement with the past literature that employed either hydrostatic, shallow-water equation-based theory or stratified Navier–Stokes equations with a linear stratification...|$|E

The {{physical}} transformation by the cosmic power of Galactus allowed Morg to fly through space and granted him exponentially enhanced superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Morg can manipulate cosmic energy for various effects, including the projection of energy bolts of cosmic force, the augmentation of his strength to even greater superhuman levels, and survive unprotected in the vacuum of outer space without the need of oxygen, food or sleep. Morg carried a 2 ft double-bladed cosmic axe with a 5 ft handle, able to <b>emanate</b> <b>waves</b> of destructive force sufficiently powerful to rend a tear in Galactus's ship and to create highly impervious force shields. The mystical pool, the Well of Life, that Morg immersed himself in augmented each of these abilities further, making him more powerful than any other single herald, even more so than the Silver Surfer. It is unknown whether this still holds true after the events of Annihilation Wave, when Silver Surfer was empowered further by Galactus.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} {{incomplete}} separation of variables is applied for solving the wave propagation problems {{in which the}} source distribution and the <b>emanated</b> <b>wave</b> are constrained by an elliptic cylinder. Solutions are obtained {{in the form of}} expansions in terms of the Mathieu modes, whose completeness makes possible to solve the problem for arbitrary source distribution and initial values of the wavefunction and its time derivative defined within the cylinder. Transient modal amplitudes are found using the Riemann (Riemann-Volterra) method. An important feature of this approach is the straightforward definition of the essentially bounded effective integration areas on the plane spanned by the longitudinal and time coordinates, taking into account the spatiotemporal constraints imposed on the source. For source turned on in a fixed instant, the method is capable to model wave propagation inside the semi-infinite and finite elliptic cylinders provided that the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are specified on the limiting cross-section(s). Recent techniques of transverse-longitudinal wave decomposition open the prospect of adapting the method to more general cylindrical configurations and to other cases, in which the incomplete separation of variables results in partial differential equations of known Riemann function (such as the Euler–Poisson–Darboux equation) ...|$|R
