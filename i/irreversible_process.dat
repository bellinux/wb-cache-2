40|$|Through a {{thermodynamic}} argument {{based on}} Planck’s {{as well as}} the total entropy irreversibility criterions it is possible to prove that contrary to common wisdom, infinite-time <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> constituted by a succession of equilibrium states in which all the thermodynamic properties are defined and quantifiable, are possible. As such, these <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> are capable of graphical representation in thermodynamic state space. It is also shown that these infinite-time <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> are thermodynamically equivalent to their finite-time counterparts.

25|$|The Carnot {{cycle is}} the most {{efficient}} possible engine, {{not only because of}} the (trivial) absence of friction and other incidental wasteful processes; the main reason is that it assumes no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures. Carnot knew that the conduction of heat between bodies at different temperatures is a wasteful and <b>irreversible</b> <b>process,</b> which must be eliminated if the heat engine is to achieve maximum efficiency.|$|E
25|$|We now {{consider}} inhomogeneous systems in which internal transformations (processes) can take place. If we calculate the entropy S1 before and S2 after such an internal process the Second Law of Thermodynamics demands that S2 ≥ S1 where the equality sign holds if {{the process is}} reversible. The difference Si = S2 - S1 is the entropy production due to the <b>irreversible</b> <b>process.</b> The Second law demands that the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease.|$|E
25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an <b>irreversible</b> <b>process</b> due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E

40|$|Popper {{challenges}} the mainstream account of irreversibility, {{which refers to}} thermodynamics, by putting forward three theses: (1) There are <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> of wave-production. (2) These processes are independent of the <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> described by thermodynamics. (3) The <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> described by thermodynamics {{do not have a}} cosmic significance. Hence, Popper traces irreversibility back to radiation instead of increase in entropy. However, I shall argue that Popper’s account runs into the same problem as the mainstream account: Both these accounts presuppose initial conditions of the universe that seem to be at least as improbable as anything that is explained by referring in the last resort to these initial conditions. Thus, neither thermodynamics nor radiation provides for an explanation of irreversibility. The appropriate place to look for such an explanation is cosmology. Popper’s main motivation in favouring radiation over entropy increase as the source of irreversibility is that he regards a statistical theory of the arrow of time as being unacceptable. By the arrow of time, he means the flow of time {{in the sense of a}} temporal view of the universe. I shall claim that <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> do not provide an argument for assuming an arrow of time in this sense. A Newtonian world can include an arrow of time without having to contain <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes.</b> Special relativity suggests an atemporal view of the universe, the so-called block universe view. The block universe can include <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> such as the ones of radiation and entropy increase. General relativity does not change that matter. Hence, in order to make a case for a physical basis of the arrow of time in the sense of a temporal view of the universe, other arguments would be needed than Popper’s argument building on <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Contrary to neoclassical {{production}} theory, Georgescu identifies {{nature as}} the exclusive {{primary source of}} all factors of production. According to the first law of thermodynamics, matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy (the conservation principle). According to the second law of thermodynamics — the entropy law — {{what happens in the}} economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes to states unavailable for human purposes (the degradation principle). This transformation constitutes a unidirectional and <b>irreversible</b> <b>process.</b> Consequently, valuable natural resources ('low entropy') are procured by the input end of the economy; the resources flow through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; and unvaluable waste and pollution ('high entropy') eventually accumulate by the output end. Mankind lives in, by and of nature, and we return our residues to nature. By so doing, the entropy of the combined nature-economy system steadily increases.|$|E
500|$|Senescence, an <b>irreversible</b> <b>process</b> {{in which}} the cell no longer divides, is a {{protective}} response to the shortening of the chromosome ends. The telomeres are long regions of repetitive noncoding DNA that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division (see Hayflick limit). In contrast, quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage (see cell cycle). Senescence in cells {{may serve as a}} functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism, which serves as a [...] "last resort" [...] mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro-growth cellular signaling. Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor (see cancer), which is potentially lethal to an organism. Therefore, the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered {{to be part of a}} strategy of protection against cancer.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>irreversible</b> <b>process</b> degrades the {{performance}} of a thermodynamic system, designed to do work or produce cooling, and results in entropy production.

2500|$|Entropy is conserved for a {{reversible}} process. A {{reversible process}} {{is one that}} does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible. [...] In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work {{to be done in the}} transition is also lost. [...] More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an <b>irreversible</b> <b>process.</b> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the total entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.
