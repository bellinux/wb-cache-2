40|$|Abstract. Using the Master-Auxiliary concept, {{described}} in Euler et al. (2001), Euler and Zebhauser (2003) investigated the feasibility {{and benefits of}} standardized network corrections for rover applications. The analysis, focused primarily in the measurement domain, demonstrated that double difference phase errors could be significantly reduced using standardized network corrections. Extended research investigated the potential of standardized network RTK messages for rover applications in the position domain (Euler et al, 2004 -I). The results of baseline processing demonstrated effective, reliable and homogeneous ambiguity resolution performance for long baselines (> 50 km) and short observation periods (> 45 sec). In <b>general</b> <b>horizontal</b> and vertical position accuracy also improved {{with the use of}} network corrections. This paper concentrates on the impact of wrongly determined integers within the reference station network on RTK performance. A theoretical study using an idealized network of reference stations is complemented by an empirical analysis of adding incorrect L 1 and L 2 ambiguities to the observations of a real network. In addition, the benefits of using network RTK corrections for a small sized network in Asia during a period of high ionospheric activity is also demonstrated.

40|$|The metal {{additive}} manufacturing industry is rising {{and so is}} the interest in new lattice structures with unique mechanical properties. Many studies have already investigated lattice structures with different geometries and their influence on mechanical properties, but {{little is known about the}} effect of specific processing characteristics that are inherent to metal {{additive manufacturing}}. Therefore this study investigates the effect of two crucial steps in the manufacturing process: the build orientation selection and heat treatment. In total the microstructure and static mechanical properties of five different orientations and three heat treatment conditions were evaluated using Ti 6 Al 4 V diamond like lattice structures. The results show a significant decrease in mechanical strength for samples that are built diagonally and a transformation of the microstructure after a HIP (hot isostatic pressing) treatment, resulting in a lower maximum strength, but higher ductility. In <b>general,</b> <b>horizontal</b> struts should be avoided during manufacturing, unless the applied load after manufacturing can be properly supported by other struts. Both a stress relief heat treatment and a HIP treatment can be used in statically loaded applications, whereas a HIP treatment is believed to be beneficial for dynamically loaded applications. This study enables an appropriate selection of build orientation and heat treatment of lattice structures for different applications. status: publishe...|$|R

There are a multitude of standard and standard consortia organizations producing market relevant standards, specifications, and technical reports in the domain of Information Communication Technology (ICT). With the number of ICT related standards and specifications numbering in the thousands, it is not readily apparent to users and developers how these standards inter-relate to form a basis of technical interoperability. There is a need to develop and document a process to identify how standards form a basis of interoperability in multiple contexts at a <b>general</b> <b>horizontal</b> technology level that covers all technology domains, and within specific vertical technology domains and sub-domains.

This study proposes to analyse the DSU review negotiations and the proposals submitted so far.

In a second step, the study offers an overview {{and analysis of the}} negotiating process in its broader context. Additionally, negotiating proposals on stage-specific and <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> of the dispute settlement mechanism are presented and analysed in depth with regard to their background, their contents and their potential implications. In a third step, the difficulties faced by negotiators in completing the DSU review are explored. Policy recommendations for further negotiations are made and the chances of a future agreement are evaluated. Finally, the study is also intended to offer a one-stop point of departure for other researchers who wish to explore further specific aspects of the DSU review.

In particular, the book covers policy and institutional developments of the agricultural sector in Eurasia with a special focus on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> relevant to the current and future potential growth of the wheat production, such as land policy, credit and finance, privatization, farm restructuring, and environmental challenges. Global food security is a major societal concern in the light of an increasing population, which is projected to grow from around seven billion today to almost 10 billion in 2050. Two most likely ways to achieve the much needed food production growth are: expansion of land cultivation or increase in crop yields and total factor productivity. The only region with a significant amount of uncultivated arable land that {{is at the same time}} experiencing rising agricultural productivity is the “Eurasian wheat belt,” comprising of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirgizstan). This makes the region a potential hotspot for driving the future growth of global agriculture. Such prospects require a detailed investigation of Eurasia’s future perspectives in terms of food production (with a focus on wheat) and its potential contribution to regional and global food security.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the results of the project EUROCROP (Agricultural research for improving arable crop competitiveness – EUROCROP - [URL] aimed at the identification of research priorities for arable crop competitiveness. The project adopts a definition of competitiveness based on a combination of economic competitiveness and social/environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the project utilises both a crop chain and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>issue</b> perspective, and develops research priorities through the interaction of the scientific level (expert group approach) and the stakeholder level (scenario analysis). The main result of the project is the elaboration of approximately eighty research topics. Among these, the main areas for research identified are A: Risk management and adaptation of arable farming; B: Innovation in cropping systems for high environmental and economic performances; C: Limiting the impact of arable crop cropping systems on green-house gas emissions; D: Better understanding of public concern about arable crop production and products and communication with global and local societies. The project confirms that a number of well established research topics retain their importance (e. g. yield improvement, plant protection).

Gathering a range of international experts and specialists {{in the field of}} production costs analysis and development, covering a range of strategic agricultural sectors of global importance, the workshop aimed to review methodologies and approaches to calculating production costs used in various sectors nationally and globally, with emphasis on exploring the applicability for effective international comparisons. A special attention was given to the methodologies and approaches for data collection and processing, factor market structure and policy inter-linkages, sectoral coverage, <b>horizontal</b> technical <b>issues,</b> and the implications for global agricultural markets. Based on the participant deliberations and discussions, a number of practically based policy recommendations towards achieving such comparisons were highlighted.
