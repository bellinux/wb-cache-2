This the negroes have since said; * * * that one of the [...] ship-boys feeling, from Captain Amasa Delano's presence, some [...] hopes of release, and not having enough prudence, dropped some [...] chance-word respecting his expectations, which being overheard and [...] understood by a slave-boy with whom he was eating at the time, the [...] latter struck him on the head with a knife, inflicting a bad [...] wound, but of which the boy is now healing; that likewise, not [...] long before the ship was brought to anchor, one of the seamen, [...] steering at the time, endangered himself by letting the blacks [...] remark some expression in his countenance, arising from a cause [...] similar to the above; but this sailor, by his heedful after [...] conduct, escaped; * * * that these statements are made to show the [...] court that from the beginning to the end of the revolt, it was [...] impossible for the deponent and his men to act otherwise than they [...] did; * * *--that the third clerk, Hermenegildo Gandix, who before [...] had been forced to live among the seamen, wearing a seaman's [...] habit, and in all respects appearing to be one for the time; he, [...] Gandix, was killed by a musket ball fired through mistake from the [...] boats before boarding; having in his fright run up the [...] mizzen-rigging, calling to the boats--"don't board," [...] lest upon [...] their boarding the negroes should kill him; that this inducing the [...] Americans to believe he some way favored the cause of the negroes, [...] they fired two balls at him, so that he fell wounded from the [...] rigging, and was drowned in the sea; * * *--that the young Don [...] Joaquin, Marques de Aramboalaza, like Hermenegildo Gandix, the [...] third clerk, was degraded to the office and appearance of a common [...] seaman; that upon one occasion when Don Joaquin shrank, the negro [...] Babo commanded the Ashantee Lecbe to take tar and heat it, and [...] pour it upon Don Joaquin's hands; * * *--that Don Joaquin was [...] killed owing to another mistake of the Americans, but one [...] impossible to be avoided, as upon the approach of the boats, Don [...] Joaquin, with a hatchet tied edge out and upright to his hand, was [...] made by the negroes to appear on the bulwarks; whereupon, seen [...] with arms in his hands and is a questionable altitude, he was shot [...] for a renegade seaman; * * *--that on the person of Don Joaquin [...] was found secreted a jewel, which, by papers that were discovered, [...] proved to have been meant for the shrine of our Lady of Mercy in [...] Lima; a votive offering, beforehand prepared and guarded, to [...] attest his gratitude, when he should have landed in Peru, his last [...] destination, for the safe conclusion of his entire voyage from [...] Spain; * * *--that the jewel, with the other effects of the late [...] Don Joaquin, is in the custody of the brethren of the Hospital de [...] Sacerdotes, awaiting the disposition of the honorable court; * * [...] *--that, owing to the condition of the deponent, as well as the [...] haste in which the boats departed for the attack, the Americans [...] were not forewarned that there were, among the apparent crew, a [...] passenger and one of the clerks disguised by the negro Babo; * * [...] *--that, beside the negroes killed in the action, some were killed [...] after the capture and re-anchoring at night, when shackled to the [...] ring-bolts on deck; that these deaths were committed by the [...] sailors, ere they could be prevented. That so soon as informed of [...] it, Captain Amasa Delano used all his authority, and, in [...] particular with his own hand, struck down Martinez Gola, who, [...] having found a razor in the pocket of an old jacket of his, which [...] one of the shackled negroes had on, was aiming it at the negro's [...] throat; that the noble Captain Amasa Delano also wrenched from the [...] hand of Bartholomew Barlo a dagger, secreted at the time of the [...] massacre of the whites, with which he was in the act of stabbing a [...] shackled negro, who, the same day, with another negro, had thrown [...] him down and jumped upon him; * * *--that, for all the events, [...] befalling through so long a time, during which the ship was in the [...] hands of the negro Babo, he cannot here give account; but that, [...] what he has said is the most substantial of what occurs to him at [...] present, and is the truth under the oath which he has taken; which [...] declaration he affirmed and ratified, after hearing it read to [...] him.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after its}} foundation, the Orchestra {{presented}} premieres {{of works by}} 20th century composers Schönberg and Bartok, and successfully performed a complete symphony series of Brahms and Beethoven, creating quite sensation among Korean concert audiences. The Orchestra was invited to represent Korea at the 1st Asia Orchestra Week held in Japan in 2002. It staged Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique, receiving remarkably favorable reviews from Japanese music audiences and the press. The orchestra also amazed Japanese audiences again at the Kawasaki Concert Hall when it was invited by Kawasaki in 2006. <b>Futhermore,</b> the orchestra performed at Smetana Hall in Prague, Hercules Hall in Munich and Musikverein Goldener Saal in Vienna of Europe. In those the birthplace of classical music, they proved its excellence and built its reputation by receiving great commendations by local press and drew big applause from the audiences.The Orchestra is also well known for its performances of the complete symphonies of Mahler. The Mahler Series, which lasted from 1999 to 2003, is considered a milestone {{in the history of}} Korean classical music and marked the start of a “Mahler Fever” in Korea. The untiring efforts of the Orchestra have been highly recognized in the Korean arts scene and won it the Hoam Prize in Art, often called Korea’s Nobel Prize, in 2005, becoming the first musical organization to do so and strengthening the orchestra’s position as the best orchestra in the nation.|$|E
5000|$|Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved {{legislatures and}} executives, while England does not. The {{authority}} of these devolved legislatures {{is dependent on}} Acts of Parliament and, although it is politically very unlikely, they can in principle be abolished at {{the will of the}} Parliament of the United Kingdom. However, the acts that created the devolved institutions are considered constitutional statutes that are not subject to implied repeal. Constitional law professors have described this as a transfer [...] "real power" [...] that alters the sovereignty of the UK Parliament to a [...] "supervisory" [...] role over the devolved legislatures in regard of devolved matters. <b>Futhermore,</b> the Scotland Act 2016 expresses the constitutional intent that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government are permanent and declares that they are not to be abolished except following a referendum in Scotland. A historical example of a legislature that was created by Act of Parliament and later abolished is the Parliament of Northern Ireland, which was set up by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and abolished, in response to political violence in Northern Ireland, by the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (Northern Ireland has since been given another legislative assembly under the Northern Ireland Act 1998). The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985 and a similar institution, the Greater London Authority, was established in 2000 by the Greater London Authority Act 1999.|$|E
