25|$|Among {{the most}} obvious {{patterns}} that the size distribution time series shows {{is that in the}} planet’s most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are large, but in the <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes,</b> smaller aerosols are very abundant. Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray. Because land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere. Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the Sahara Desert in north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or natural fire activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from August–October, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is largely responsible for the areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe, especially in their summer.|$|E

2500|$|The arid, {{continental}} conditions {{characteristic of}} the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape.

The extinct Mesozoic conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby Bennettitales. Cycads were also common, as were ginkgos and tree ferns in the forest. Smaller ferns were probably the dominant undergrowth. Caytoniaceous seed ferns were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.

40|$|Observed {{variations}} of the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH 4) {{over the past two}} decades remain the subject of debate. These variations reflect changes in emission, uptake, and atmospheric chemistry and transport. We isolate changes in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CH 4 using a wavelet transform. We report a previously undocumented persistent decrease in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CH 4 at six out of seven <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> sites over the past two to three decades. The observed amplitude changes are statistically significant for sites at Barrow, Alaska and Ocean Station M, Norway, which we find are the most sensitive of our sites to <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> wetland emissions. We find using a series of numerical experiments using the TM 5 atmospheric chemistry transport model that increasing wetland emissions and/or decreasing fossil fuel emissions can explain these observed changes, but no significant role for trends in meteorology and tropical wetlands. We also find no evidence in past studies to support a significant role for variations in the hydroxyl radical sink of atmospheric CH 4. Using the TM 5 model we find that changes in fossil fuel emissions of CH 4, described by a conservative state-of-the-science bottom-up emission inventory, are not sufficient to reconcile observed changes in atmospheric CH 4 at these sites. The remainder of the observed trend in amplitude, by process of elimination, must be due to an increase in <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> wetland emissions, corresponding to an annual increase of at least 0. 7  %/yr (equivalent to 5  Tg CH 4 /yr over 30 years) ...|$|R

60|$|In 1856, a very {{remarkable}} {{addition to}} {{our knowledge of the}} nature of the sea bottom in <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes</b> was made by Professor Bailey of West Point. Lieutenant Brooke, of the United States Navy, who was employed in surveying the Sea of Kamschatka, had succeeded in obtaining specimens of the sea bottom from greater depths than any hitherto reached, namely from 2,700 fathoms (16,200 feet) in 56° 46' N., and 168° 18' E.; and from 1,700 fathoms (10,200 feet) in 60° 15' N. and 170° 53' E. On examining these microscopically, Professor Bailey found, as Ehrenberg had done in the case of mud obtained on the opposite side of the Arctic region, that the fine mud was made up of shells of Diatomacoe, of spicula of sponges, and of Radiolaria, with a small admixture of mineral matters, but without a trace of any calcareous organisms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMeasurements of the {{complete}} isotopic composition of atmospheric CO (13 CO, 14 CO, C 17 O, C 18 O) {{have been carried out}} at the <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> stations Spitsbergen, Norway, and Alert, Canada. The annual changes of the isotope signatures reflect the seasonally varying contributions from the individual CO sources and the OH sink. Short-term variability is small at the remote sampling locations. Nevertheless, the interannual variability is considerable, in particular for the summer minimum. The most prominent event was a strong increase in CO in 1998 that persisted for several months. Using the isotope signatures it is possible to clearly identify extraordinarily strong biomass burning during that season as the cause for this large-scale CO anomaly. In 1997, on the other hand, biomass burning emissions were very low, leading to an unusually low summer minimum and corresponding isotope signatures. The results underscore that monitoring of CO and its isotopic composition at remote high latitude stations is a valuable tool to better understand long-term variations of CO that are representative for the whole <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> region...|$|R

60|$|WHILE {{the various}} {{companies}} we have noticed were pushing their enterprises {{far and wide}} {{in the wilds of}} Canada, and along the course of the great western waters, other adventurers, intent on the same objects, were traversing the watery wastes of the Pacific and skirting the northwest coast of America. The last voyage of that renowned but unfortunate discoverer, Captain Cook, had made known the vast quantities of the sea-otter to be found along that coast, and the immense prices to be obtained for its fur in China. It was as if a new gold coast had been discovered. Individuals from various countries dashed into this lucrative traffic, so that in the year 1792, there were twenty-one vessels under different flags, plying along the coast and trading with the natives. The greater part of them were American, and owned by Boston merchants. They generally remained on the coast and about the adjacent seas, for two years, carrying on as wandering and adventurous a commerce on the water as did the traders and trappers on land. Their trade extended along the whole coast from California to the <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> They would run in near shore, anchor, and wait for the natives to come off in their canoes with peltries. The trade exhausted at one place, they would up anchor and off to another. In this way they would consume the summer, and when autumn came on, would run down to the Sandwich Islands and winter in some friendly and plentiful harbor. In the following year they would resume their summer trade, commencing at California and proceeding north: and, having {{in the course of the}} two seasons collected a sufficient cargo of peltries, would make the best of their way to China. Here they would sell their furs, take in teas, nankeens, and other merchandise, and return to Boston, after an absence of two or three years.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the GSFC coupled {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) model to study the impact of increasing carbon dioxide from 1980 to 2050 on the recovery of ozone to its pre- 1980 amounts. We find that the changes in temperature and circulation arising from increasing CO 2 affect ozone recovery in a manner which varies greatly with latitude, altitude, and time of year. Middle and upper stratospheric ozone recovers faster at all latitudes due to a slowing of the ozone catalytic loss cycles. In the lower stratosphere, the recovery of tropical ozone is delayed due to a decrease in production and a speed up in the overturning circulation. The recovery of <b>high</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> lower stratospheric ozone is delayed in spring and summer due {{to an increase in}} springtime heterogeneous chemical loss, and is speeded up in fall and winter due to increased downwelling. The net effect on the <b>higher</b> <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> column ozone is to slow down the recovery from late March to late July, while making it faster at other times. In the high southern latitudes, the impact of CO 2 cooling is negligible.
