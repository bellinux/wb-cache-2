St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate.

It {{is likely that the}} Spanish chose the Indian town of Maniani as the location for the new Spanish settlement. On 20 July 1536, Pedro de Alvarado sent instructions to found the new city, to be called Gracias a Dios, to provide better communication between Honduras and Guatemala. Pedro de Alvarado used the town of Tencoa as a base of operations, and sent his brother Gonzalo with 40 Spanish soldiers, and an unspecified number of indigenous allies, to help establish the new town. Alvarado appointed the members of the town council, and assigned 100 Spanish citizens to inhabit it. The natives around Gracias a Dios where not completely subjugated, however, and there were violent indigenous rebellions in the province until around 1539. As at San Pedro, Alvarado annulled all previous encomiendas in the region and reassigned them. Gonzalo de Alvarado had been exploring the central region around Siguatepeque, the Tinto River and Yoro, successfully dealing with native resistance and collecting supplies for San Pedro. He had about a dozen cavalry and fifteen or so infantry under his command, and joined up with ten more soldiers under Gaspar Xuárez de Ávila, who was to serve as his lieutenant.
