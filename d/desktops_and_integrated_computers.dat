Based {{on the idea}} of the semantic desktop, non-technical users can create, manipulate and mash-up RDF data with Konduit, and thus generate simple applications or workflows, which are aimed to simplify their everyday work by automating repetitive tasks. The platform allows to combine data from both web <b>and</b> <b>desktop</b> <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> it with existing desktop functionality, thus bringing us closer to a convergence of Web <b>and</b> <b>desktop.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Digital Performance is a {{very wide}} {{category}} filled {{with a range of}} productions, it is a generic performance but with an extra element of incorporating <b>and</b> <b>integrating</b> <b>computer</b> technologies <b>and</b> techniques into the production. You can incorporate multimedia into any type of performance whether it is live on a theatre stage or in the street. Anything as small as video recordings or a visual image classes the production as multimedia and therefore a digital performance. When the key role in a performance is the computer technologies rather than it being an additional role is when it is classed as a digital performance. This can be as little as projections on a screen in front of a live audience to creating and devising a performance in an online environment to using animation and sensing software’s.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{articles}} and studies {{have pointed to}} a divergence of opinion between economists and ecologists on environmental matters. This paper examines these differences as they apply to the debate over climate change. In particular, the paper examines the models that economists use for making decisions regarding climate change policy: cost–benefit analysis; utility theory; time-discounting; <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> models. For each {{of these types of}} model, the paper examines how ecologists might criticise the model structure, or its assumptions, or its results. The paper concludes that, although economic models are of great use in guiding decision-makers on some aspects of the problem, they provide an incomplete picture of the fundamental decision of when and how much to act to avoid climate change. cost–benefit analysis; integrated economic models; time-discounting, utility theory; climate change. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{assert that}} the {{critical}} leadership role for Civil Engineers now is to develop and apply meaningful metrics and processes for creation, use and stewardship of the built environment, {{in a way that}} is sustainable across space and time. We set out a broad definition of sustainability, and describe a novel design process for creation of engineered systems using integrated, multi-disciplinary computer-based virtual models. The big idea in this paper is that Civil Engineering educators should teach leadership in sustainable development of the built environment using new integrated, multi-disciplinary computer-based virtual performance models of engineered systems, using a pedagogical method and curriculum that emphasize: multi-disciplinary theory, work with real projects as part of the university laboratory and studio teaching experience, explicitly recognize the interrelated methods of science, engineering design and policy, and use multiple <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> models, simulations <b>and</b> visualization tools...|$|R

In the first step, user can select several color spaces and apply leaning and non-learning methods to segment the object. In the filtering step, morphological filter has been applied for image noise removal. In the localization step, connected component labelling and K-means technique are used for objects classification. Type of cancer malignancy is determined based on a score calculated from ABCD characteristics. Experiment has been conducted successfully using skin cancer images taken from internet. This result proved that the developed framework can be used for supporting the early diagnosing of cancer. In general, this research can contribute to the computer science knowledge especially in field of computer vision...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{miniaturization}} and {{computing power}} {{have set the}} scene {{for the emergence of}} powerful wearable computer systems capable of active computer vision. A lightweight miniature multimedia computer can be worn by a user, receive input from a camera to sense the local environment, present virtual annotations on a heads up display, and network with others through a wireless modem. Applications include field repair, on site tele-medicine, and augmented tourism. The very notion of such a wearable, networked, augmented reality system has an inherent appeal, as it liberates computing from the <b>desktop</b> <b>and</b> <b>integrates</b> computing with everyday activities. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that augmented reality interfaces can be achieved using basic 1 -D or 2 -D imaging methods. The notion of Personal Context is introduced to address information overload in augmented reality by taking a user-centric model in gathering awareness and context information. Two functional personal context prototypes were built and discussed, showing potential for piano and dance applications. Balancing the body-centric focus of personal context, the idea of mosaicing as a world model for augmented reality registration and telecollaboration is also presented, and realized in another working proof-of-concept system. Finally, a systematic study on accuracy, reliability, and speed of existing and new mosaicing methods (including the method used in the mosaicing prototype) was conducted, identifying their strengths and weaknesses as engines for augmented reality world modelling...|$|R
