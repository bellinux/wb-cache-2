5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of evidence dating to Unas' reign, we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas' time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu. Similar reliefs {{have been found in}} preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; however, for example the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well that {{they live in a}} world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E
25|$|The only dated {{works by}} Lübeck are two cantatas {{composed}} in Stade in November 1693, both {{commissioned by the}} Swedish administration in Stade in memory of Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark. Aside from these pieces, we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the composer's activities at Stade. His reputation as organist, organ consultant and teacher grew steadily, and finally landed him the position at St. Nikolai in Hamburg in 1702; he was succeeded in Stade by his son, Peter Paul (16801732). Hamburg was already {{one of the largest}} cities in Germany and had a long organ tradition associated first with pupils of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck: Heinrich Scheidemann, Jacob Praetorius, and others. A number of other important composers worked in Hamburg in the late 17th century: among them Matthias Weckmann, who helped organize the concert life of the city, and the aforementioned Reincken, one of the most celebrated organists of his time. However, by the time of Lübeck's arrival, only Reincken was still alive, and the musical life of the city, as well as its economic position, was in a slow decline. In 1720 Johann Sebastian Bach applied for a post at the Jacobikirche, but withdrew the application after acquainting himself with the local circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the price of land began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up. In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little. We know that it involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E

25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E

[...] No surprise that much of the public has ended up with a misimpression about the remarkable strength of our scientific understanding and the need for action". [...] He concludes, [...] "more and more pieces are being written by senior political reporters, who <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about global warming". Romm also believes that scientists and politicians need to be more effective communicators about climate change.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E

500|$|Until {{at least}} the eighteenth century, shamanism was {{at the core of}} Manchu spiritual life and {{differentiated}} Manchus from Han Chinese even as Manchu Bannermen garrisoned in various Chinese cities were adopting many aspects of the Chinese lifestyle. In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned the publication of a [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] to revive and regulate shamanic practices, which he feared were becoming lost. He had it distributed to Bannermen to guide their practice, but we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the effect of this policy. Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies. Partly because of their secret aspect, these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital. Even after the [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] was translated into Chinese and published in the 1780s, outsiders had little understanding of these practices.|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} [...] "there seems ample {{indication}} that Gefjon represents {{one aspect of}} a once powerful goddess of the north, the figure representing in Scandinavian myths as either Frigg, the wife of Odin, or Freyja, sister of fertility god Freyr. Freyja, desired by gods, giants and dwarves alike, acted as dispenser of bounty and inspirer of sexual love {{between men and women}} like the Greek Aphrodite." [...] In addition, Davidson says that [...] "as Axel Olrik (1901) pointed out long ago, we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about Gefion, and it is possible that she can be identified with Frigg or Freyja" [...] and not only does the Prose Edda associate her with an afterlife realm of the dead, [...] "in Lokasenna, Loki claims that Gefion was given a jewel by a lover, traditions that would fit in very well with what we know of Freyja." ...|$|E
500|$|Offa died on 29 July 796, and may {{be buried}} in Bedford, {{though it is not}} clear that the [...] "Bedeford" [...] named in that charter was {{actually}} Bedford. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith [...] "has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son." [...] It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.|$|E

500|$|Hordern cited Saint's Days {{negative}} publicity {{as having done}} his career [...] "the power of good" [...] as it {{brought him to the}} attention of the director Glen Byam Shaw, who cast him in a series of plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1951. Among the roles were Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. Hordern claimed to <b>know</b> <b>very</b> little about the bard's works and sought advice from friends about how best to prepare for the roles. The same year, he travelled down to Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames, to film Scrooge, an adaptation of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, in which he played Marley's ghost. Reviews were mixed with The New York Times giving it a favourable write-up, while Time magazine remained ambivalent. The Aberdeen Evening Express echoed the comments made by an American reviewer by calling Scrooge a [...] "trenchant and inspiring Christmas show". The author Fred Guida, writing in his book Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination in 2000, thought that Marley's ghost, though a [...] "small but pivotal role", was [...] "brilliantly played" [...] by Hordern.|$|E
500|$|Clark's {{loyalty to}} the Democratic Party was {{questioned}} by some {{as soon as he}} entered the race. Senator Joe Lieberman called Clark's party choice a matter of [...] "political convenience, not conviction." [...] Republican Governor Bill Owens of Colorado and University of Denver president Marc Holtzman have claimed Clark once said [...] "I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned my phone calls." [...] Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered [...] "very directly" [...] and [...] "wasn't a joke." [...] Katharine Q. Seelye wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was [...] "the only party that did not have a nominee." [...] On May 11, 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the Pulaski County Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was [...] "very glad we've got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul O'Neill—people I <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well—our president George W. Bush." [...] U.S. News & World Report ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican.|$|E
500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E
