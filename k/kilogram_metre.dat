5000|$|The term rotatum is {{not universally}} {{recognized}} but is commonly used. This word {{is derived from}} the Latin word rotātus meaning to rotate.

5000|$|Heat {{capacity}} or {{thermal capacity}} is a measurable physical quantity {{equal to the}} ratio of the heat added to (or removed from) an object to the resulting temperature change.

5000|$|A major {{difference}} between Gaussian and SI units is {{in the definition of}} the unit of charge. In SI, a separate base unit (the ampere) is associated with electromagnetic phenomena, with the consequence that something like electrical charge (1 coulomb = 1 ampere × 1 second) is a unique dimension of physical quantity and is not expressed purely in terms of the mechanical units (<b>kilogram,</b> <b>metre,</b> second). On the other hand, in Gaussian units, the unit of electrical charge (the statcoulomb, statC) can be written entirely as a dimensional combination of the mechanical units (gram, centimetre, second), as: ...|$|E

Other consequences of this definition are that in SI the value of vacuum permeability (μ0) is fixed at exactly [...] Since {{the speed of light}} in vacuum (c) is also fixed, it follows from the relationshipthat the vacuum permittivity (ε0) has a fixed value and fromthat the impedance of free space (Z0) likewise has a fixed value.|$|E
50|$|Measurements most {{commonly}} use the International System of Units (SI) as a comparison framework. The system defines seven fundamental units: <b>kilogram,</b> <b>metre,</b> candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole. Six of these units are defined {{without reference to}} a particular physical object {{which serves as a}} standard (artifact-free), while the kilogram is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sèvres near Paris. Artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a physical constant or other invariable phenomena in nature, in contrast to standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.|$|E
40|$|The next {{revision}} to the International System of Units will {{emphasize the}} relationship between the base units (<b>kilogram,</b> <b>metre,</b> second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole) and fundamental constants of nature (the speed of light, c, the Planck constant, h, the elementary charge, e, the Boltzmann constant, k B, the Avogadro constant, N A, etc). The redefinition cannot proceed without consistency between two complementary metrological approaches to measuring h: a 'physics' approach, using watt balances and the equivalence principle between electrical and mechanical force, and a 'chemistry' approach that can be viewed as determining the mass of a single atom of silicon. We report the first high precision physics and chemistry results that agree within 12 parts per billion: h (watt balance) = 6. 626 070 63 (43) 7 10 - 34 Js and h(silicon) = 6. 626 070 55 (21) 7 10 - 34 Js. When combined with values determined by other metrology laboratories, this work helps to constrain our knowledge of h to 20 parts per billion, moving us closer to a redefinition of the metric system used around the world. 9 2012 BIPM & IOP Publishing Ltd.
