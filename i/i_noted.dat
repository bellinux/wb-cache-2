In my earlier report <b>I</b> <b>noted</b> that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, however, she was {{grooming}} her favourite Şahin Giray, who resided at her court, for the role. As time went on, {{the rule of}} Devlet became increasingly untenable. In July 1775, he sent a group of envoys to Constantinople to negotiate a reentry of the Crimean Khanate into the Ottoman Empire. This action was in direct defiance of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which he asked the Ottomans to scrap. Famed diplomat Ahmed Resmî Efendi, who had helped draft the treaty, refused to provide any assistance to the Khanate, not wanting to start another disastrous war with Russia. Empress Catherine gave an order to invade Crimea in November 1776. Her forces quickly gained control of Perekop, {{at the entrance to}} the peninsula. In January 1777, Russian-supported Şahin Giray crossed into Crimea over the Kerch Strait, much as Devlet had done. Devlet, aware of his impending defeat, abdicated and fled to Constantinople. Şahin was installed as a puppet Khan, infuriating the Muslim population of the peninsula. When he heard this news, Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid <b>I</b> <b>noted</b> [...] "Şahin Giray is a tool. The aim of the Russians is to take Crimea." [...] Şahin, a member of the ruling House of Giray, attempted a series of reforms to [...] "modernise" [...] the Khanate. These included attempts to centralise power in the hands of the Khan, establishing [...] "autocratic" [...] rule, much as in Russia. Previously, power had been distributed between the leaders of different clans, called beys. He attempted to institute state taxation, a conscripted and centralised army, and to replace the traditional religion-based Ottoman legal system with civil law. These reforms, aimed at disrupting the old Ottoman order, were despised by the Crimean populace.|$|E

2500|$|Often {{referred}} to with the accompanying parenthetical title [...] "(Krishna, Where Are You?)", [...] "I Am Missing You" [...] {{is a love}} song dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna. In the choruses, Shankar's words mourn the apparent absence of Krishna from his life, but in the repeated verses he acknowledges: [...] "Though I can't see you / I hear your flute all the while." [...] The latter line reflects {{the importance of the}} flute – or bansuri – in the Hindu tradition, since it is the musical instrument most commonly associated with the deity. In his second autobiography, Raga Mala (1997), Shankar describes the words as [...] "a simple lyric that just gushed out of me when I was travelling on a plane". Speaking to journalist Graham Reid in 1998, Shankar recalled: [...] "I think we were travelling somewhere in the States … it was very short, maybe six or eight lines. It came very spontaneously with the tune and <b>I</b> <b>noted</b> it down." [...] In addition to the lyrics being in English rather than Hindi or Bengali, the latter being Shankar's first language, the song's melody follows Western convention, with distinct chord changes instead of the single-chord, monodic drone common to Indian music.|$|E
