5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no <b>great</b> <b>feeling</b> for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

500|$|Bellew's {{successor}} as Garter, Sir Anthony Wagner, {{referred to}} him in his 1988 memoirs; he wrote that Bellew seemed [...] "in early years a temperamental, combative Irishman not easy to live with though always possessed of <b>great</b> <b>feeling</b> for ceremonial and heraldic design and a skillful pen and pencil. In later years I have found him ever more charming". According to The Independent, Bellew enjoyed creating colourful grants of arms, drew inspiration from medieval heraldry and allowed multi-coloured wreaths to be used and adorned with badges {{for the first time}} in English heraldry. As Garter, he managed the financial affairs of the College well, maintaining [...] "a firm hand on the tiller", and, when faced with the task of organising the Coronation, his knowledge of tradition was complemented by his eye for design: [...] "At heart he was a designer, an artist and a perfectionist in all things", remarks his obituary in The Times.|$|E

Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review calling the film: [...] "A tender, often humorous tale with sparkling performances." [...] In her opinion, [...] "Koechlin does an exceptional job navigating the shoals {{of this as a}} kooky drama queen" [...] while [...] "Shah brings <b>great</b> <b>feeling</b> and complexity {{to the role of the}} wise, tolerant Shiv." ...|$|E

[...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Peter Neal {{was making a}} short film {{documentary}} about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking). [...] On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". [...] The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced. [...] For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand. [...] Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar. [...] After a false start, he settles into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "100 percent country blues... s with <b>great</b> <b>feeling,</b> however artificial {{the circumstances of the}} session may have been". [...] Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James. [...] Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as [...] "Big Fat Mama" [...] and [...] "Big Road Blues". [...] The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C–F–B–E–G–C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style. [...] At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with [...] "Did you think I could do that?" [...] In addition to the 1968 documentary, the [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] performance is included in the 1973 film Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack album (re-released on Blues). [...] In the UK, it was released by Reprise Records as a single in 1973 with the Experience's adaptation of B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby" [...] recorded at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 as the B-side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The current {{research}} tested the hypothesis that, because infidelity entails somewhat different negative consequences {{for men and}} women, men and women display different emotional and behavioral reactions aimed at reducing the costs of infidelity. The study utilized an open-response method in which participants wrote about their reactions to an imagined infidelity. Findings suggest that, in response to partner infidelity, men display <b>greater</b> <b>feelings</b> of anger and a greater propensity for violence (particularly toward the male interloper), whereas women display <b>greater</b> <b>feelings</b> of sadness and a greater inclination toward seeking out sources of compensatory social affiliation (particularly from existing friendships). The {{current research}} {{is some of the}} first to identify functional responses designed to help women and men offset the social costs inflicted by a partner’s infidelity...|$|R
