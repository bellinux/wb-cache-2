5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> of sale and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E

[...] He showed a marked ethnic nationalism in that he promoted English as the nation's sole official language, and {{the separation of church and}} state, a view that was directed particularly at the Catholic, French-speaking Québécois.

2500|$|While Kibbey was {{generally}} {{a supporter of}} the mining industry, he felt the territory's mines were not paying their fair share in taxes. [...] Proclaiming [...] "To pay proper taxes is a duty", the governor sought to remedy this situation. [...] His first effort was an attempt to have the assessed value of the mines increased for property taxes. [...] He was unsuccessful in this effort until August 1905, when he asked for the resignation of A. F. Donau from the territorial board of equalization. [...] The day after Donau resigned, a previously unsuccessful proposal to raise the assessed values of the territory's mines from US$4million to US$14million was passed. [...] Then during his address to the 24th Arizona Territorial Legislature, Kibbey renewed his call for higher taxes. [...] In the address he noted that while the mines had assessed values of between 3 and 5% of their real values, all other taxed property, {{with the exception of the}} railroads, were assessed at 40 to 70% of their real value. [...] During the legislative session, mining interests used their influence to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed that set the assessed property value for a mine at 25% of the value of the bullion produced by the mine. [...] The mining interests expected that Kibbey would find this assessment value too low and veto the bill. [...] Kibbey instead signed the bill into law, noting it increased tax revenues to the territory and was an improvement over the previous situation.|$|E

If you've ever looked at one of those cones, you will understand that those seeds are not very easy to get at. But with this kind of a bill it is no trouble at all.

There will be from six to seven hundred pounds, I cannot say how much exactly, for the cargo was not weighed, but it is somewhat over two hundred tons at three pounds a ton, and there is, besides, a hundred pounds for the passage-money of twenty invalid sailors, so you see you get the ship for practically about a hundred pounds, to which there will have to be added the payment of a captain, mate, and ten Italian sailors. She was valued by a court of naval officers at eight hundred and fifty pounds, that being the price they considered that she might fetch if sold there. I should say that she is worth quite double that. She is about three hundred tons, and carried six guns, so at any rate you are likely to make a thousand by the transaction.|$|E
60|$|And therefore, if, {{notwithstanding}} all I have said, {{it still}} be thought necessary to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> {{brought in for}} repealing Christianity, I would humbly offer an amendment, that instead of the word Christianity may be put religion in general, which I conceive will much better answer all the good ends proposed by the projectors of it. For {{as long as we}} leave in being a God and His Providence, with all the necessary consequences which curious and inquisitive men will be apt to draw from such promises, we do not strike {{at the root of the}} evil, though we should ever so effectually annihilate the present scheme of the Gospel; for of what use is freedom of thought if it will not produce freedom of action, which is the sole end, how remote soever in appearance, of all objections against Christianity? and therefore, the Freethinkers consider it as a sort of edifice, wherein all the parts have such a mutual dependence on each other, that if you happen to pull out one single nail, the whole fabric must fall to the ground. This was happily expressed by him who had heard of a text brought for proof of the Trinity, which in an ancient manuscript was differently read; he thereupon immediately took the hint, and by a sudden deduction of a long Sorites, most logically concluded: why, if it be as you say, I may safely drink on, and defy the parson. From which, and many the like instances easy to be produced, I think nothing can be more manifest than that the quarrel is not against any particular points of hard digestion in the Christian system, but against religion in general, which, by laying restraints on human nature, is supposed the great enemy to the freedom of thought and action.|$|E
