Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the withering fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and the onslaught of the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry chased the Russians away.|$|E

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|Dispatched to France in February 1915, the Canadian Division {{was briefly}} {{initiated}} to trench warfare {{on the periphery}} of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle before being attached to the British 2nd Army under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April that the Canadians bore the brunt of the most furious German attack of the year. In the afternoon at 5.00 pm the Germans began heavy shelling of the French trenches and the Canadians and the French Algerian troops stationed next to them saw a fog traveling across no-mans land, covering the advance of German forces. The fog was chlorine gas, the first occasion in which this substance had been used in warfare. The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6,000 casualties <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> and the Canadians were consequently forced to defend twice the length of their front line in the face of a new and deadly weapon. Although the Canadian Division held on for more than two days, much ground was lost and the division had themselves suffered over 50% casualties, nearly 6,000 men.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{defenders}} of Fort 54 fired incessantly, {{but by then}} the Russian horse artillery had clear line of sight onto {{the top of the}} rampart. For unknown reasons the Poles did not use the grenades prepared for defence in close quarters. When the breach was completed, two Russian regiments (13th 'Belozerskiy' and 14th 'Olonetskiy') charged into the gap. Other Russian soldiers stormed the earthwork itself, using bayonets as steps to climb onto the parapet. After several salvoes, Polish infantry retreated to within the fort, to fire at Russian soldiers appearing on top of the rampart. The first to cross the obstacles was Pavel Liprandi with his men. With 10:1 Russian superiority, the bayonet fight was short, and between 60 and 80 surviving Poles were taken prisoner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> Soon afterwards the gunpowder magazine was set on fire and exploded, killing over 100 Russians, among them the commanding officer of the 13th Regiment, Col. Ivan Khludenev. The explosion was fictionalised and immortalised in Adam Mickiewicz's poem Reduta Ordona (Ordon's Redoubt). Altogether the Russian losses during the storming of Fort 54 were between 500 and 600 killed. The dead were buried in a mass grave in a shell-hole, which later became the nucleus of the Orthodox Cemetery in Warsaw.|$|E

25|$|The Union's {{momentary}} {{inability to}} defend the opening in the works caused a weak spot in its line at the Columbia Pike from the Carter House to the cotton gin.

25|$|Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves {{produced}} by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water - including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean the distance between wave crests can surpass , and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600-800kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves {{produced by}} an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1897, the {{railroad}} had {{been interested in}} alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad's shops in Aurora had built an unreliable three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was hugely impractical (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel) and had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes)</b> and was therefore impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. None of that would do in a railroad locomotive; however, there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then.|$|E
