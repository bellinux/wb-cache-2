The engine, like others in use thereabout, shed steam and hot water round it from every leaky joint, and kept Harry busy feeding it with birch billets and liquid from the well. There were sheaves to pitch to the separator, grain bags to be filled and hauled to the straw-pile granary, while between times we drove wagon-loads of chaff and straw {{bouncing}} behind the bronco teams to complete that altogether western structure. Its erection is simple. You drive stout birch poles into the sod, wattle them with willow branches, and lash on whatever comes handiest for rafters; then pile the straw all over it several fathoms thick, and leave the wind and snow to do the rest. When it has settled into shape and solidity it is both <b>frost</b> and rain <b>proof,</b> and often requires a hay-knife to get into it.|$|R

40|$|Requirements {{regarding}} efficient {{energy use}} and reduction in CO 2 emissions {{are becoming increasingly}} strict. The building sector accounts for {{a large part of}} CO 2 emissions and the potential for reductions within this sector should be considerable. This thesis is a continuation of the author's project thesis. The main focus is to improve the earlier model emphasizing the modeling of the interactions between the leisure home building and the ground. The goal is to develop a prototype of a leisure home where sanitary installations are kept <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> throughout the year without the use of primary energy sources or electricity, minimizing net CO 2 emissions. The building envelope is constructed of poorly insulated log walls. The sanitary installations are placed in a thermally insulated internal zone, and an active solar heating system is developed to transfer heat into the ground in this internal zone. The intention is to store the heat, transferred to the internal zone during sunny periods, in a thermal mass under the cabin. This would then passively arise during cold periods, maintaining <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> conditions. The leisure home is planned to be located in the southern mountain regions of Norway. Different simulation tools were considered for modeling the leisure home and its energy system. The dynamic simulation tool ESP-r was chosen, and an improved model from the project thesis was developed. Different methods and theories concerning how the solar heating system and the ground could be modeled have been studied. The interactions between the building and the ground were modeled by implementing a new basement zone for the leisure home, and defining a BASESIMP configuration as boundary conditions for the surfaces adjacent to the ground. BASESIMP performs quasi 3 -dimensional calculations for the heat transfer between the building and the ground. Since the heat storage is not taken into account in the BASESIMP configuration, the storage is represented in the ground construction; the basement floor of the inner zone. The solar heating system is represented in a control loop. The control loop injects electric heat into the basement floor for a given period each day. The electric data is based on solar radiation data, and the time intervals for when heat is injected into the floor are determined from when solar radiation is available in the day. Climate data from &# 214;stersund, Sweden has been used as an approximation as there was no available climate file for the southern mountain regions of Norway. Different system parameters have been changed to investigate the influence they have on the temperature conditions in the internal zones throughout the year. The internal zones maintain much more stable temperatures throughout the year than the outer zones. This shows that isolating the <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> zones in the leisure home, represent a major advantage in the design process. The ground construction in the basement floor of the inner zone has been modeled as a thermal mass with high density and high specific heat capacity. This dense thermal mass is modeled to account for the whole area under the cabin. A south facing solar collector with an area of 4 m 2 and an inclination of 70 &# 176; indicates that the temperature in the internal zones stays above 4. 2 &# 176;C throughout the year, subject to the given ground conditions and without collecting heat during May until August. The delivered energy to the ground construction in the basement floor of the inner zone for a year under the given conditions and with a collector efficiency of 45 % turned out to be 878 kWh. Heat transfer from the ground into the internal zone turned out to have a significant heat contribution in cold periods. Results also showed a noticeable potential for seasonal storage of the energy extracted from the solar heating system. For further studies, the interactions between the heat storage and the surrounding ground should be studied in a 3 -dimensional conduction program. Insulation regarding snow should also be implemented in a future model to study the effect of extra insulation on the ground surface. </p...|$|E
40|$|Requirements {{regarding}} efficient {{energy use}} in buildings {{are becoming more}} and more strict. New ideas and technologies are constantly sought to face the challenge of reducing global CO 2 emissions. The building sector accounts for a large part of energy use. The potential for more efficient energy use in this sector is significant and will also contribute towards reduced CO 2 emissions. This master thesis is a continuation of a project work report written in collaboration with Ida Karin Aur&# 229;en during the fall semester of 2012. A prototype of a leisure home was developed where sanitary installations were kept <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> throughout the year without the use of primary energy. This was achieved by placing sanitary installations within well-insulated internal zones, and by using an active solar heating system and heat exchange with the ground. The goal of this thesis is to improve the model developed in the project work report. The main focus is to improve the design of the solar heating system to better approximate a realistic situation. Aur&# 229;en&# 146;s master thesis focused on the interaction between the leisure building and surrounding ground, and the ground model developed in her report is further used in this thesis. The leisure building consists of two floors and is constructed of poorly insulated log walls. Each floor has a thermally insulated internal zone where sanitary installations are deemed installed. The goal is to maintain <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> conditions throughout the year within the internal zones to avoid damages to sanitary installations. The idea is to promote seasonal heat storage by storing heat collected during sunny periods in thermal mass located below the building. The desired effect is that the heat transfer is reversed during cold, dark winter months, so that stored heat is released upwards and into the leisure building, preventing formation of frost in the internal zones. The dynamic simulation tool ESP-r (Environmental System Performance Research) is used to analyze the leisure building. The interactions between the building and the ground are modeled using a submerged basement zone defined with a BASESIMP configuration. BASESIMP performs quasi 3 -dimensional heat transfer calculations between a building and the ground. BASESIMP does not account for heat storage. The heat storage potential in the ground is analyzed through the internal ground floor construction. The floor is modeled as a thermally massive concrete slab with high density and high specific heat capacity. Heat storage calculations are performed based on heat stored in this concrete slab. The solar heating system is built up using the plants and systems network in ESP-r. The system contains three components; flat plate solar collector, circulation pump and hydronic floor. The hydronic floor component is a water-based floor heating circuit and is embedded within the concrete slab. Heat from the solar collector is transferred to the hydronic floor heating the slab below the internal zones. Towards the end of the winter, the remaining energy stored in the slab, and the incoming solar radiation injected to the slab, are too limited to make a significant heat contribution to the internal zones. Therefore, heat collected from January 1 st to April 30 th is injected directly to zone air of the internal first floor. The leisure home is planned located in southern mountain regions in Norway. ESP-r does not have available climate data for this area, and therefore climate data from &# 214;stersund, Sweden has been used as an approximation. The building has also been tested with climate data from Fornebu, Norway which is a typical coastal region in the south of Norway. Different parameters have been altered to optimize the model with regards to raising the minimum temperatures in the internal zones. Results show that the internal zones maintain much more stable conditions throughout the year than the outer zones. This shows that isolating sanitary installations within well-insulated internal zones can be a major advantage in the design process to reduce the amount of energy needed to keep the facilities frost free. A south-oriented solar collector with an area of 2 m 2, and an slope of 70 &# 176; achieves sufficient energy for <b>frost</b> <b>proof</b> conditions for both locations. The minimum temperatures in the internal ground- and first floor are 5. 29 &# 176;C and 3. 10 &# 176;C with &# 214;stersund climate data. The delivered energy from the hydronic floor component to the concrete slab, turns out to be 482 kWh with &# 214;stersund climate data, and 547 kWh with Fornebu climate data, with a collector efficiency of 68 %. Results show that heat collected in the spring and summer significantly affect the minimum temperatures occurring around mid-February in the following year. For further studies and optimization of the model, the interactions between the heat storage and surrounding ground should be studied more thoroughly. The effect which snow may have on the ground conditions should also be studied. Evacuated tube solar collectors are probably more suited for Scandinavian climate than flat plate collectors as used in this thesis. The plant database in ESP-r has no option to model evacuated tube collectors. The effect of such could be studied with another simulation tool. </p...|$|E
