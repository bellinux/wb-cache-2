40|$|Abstract:- The {{conventional}} step-down converter {{is powered}} by a voltage source. Some applications, e. g. railway power supplies, need a step-down and inductive <b>input</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The proposed structure is compared with the conventional step-down converter with LC input filter. One surprising advantage is that the current rating of the inductor L 2 is half the value of the corresponding inductor in the conventional structure by identical ratings of all other devices when it is operated above 50 % duty cycle. PSPICE simulation is performed to show the dynamic behavior. The structure is well suited for unidirectional DC voltage adaptation, (the voltage of the DC power grid exceeds the voltage rating of the DC-load).

40|$|Abstract Huang {{presented}} a trade-off problem, taking both product quality and process adjustment cost into account, {{to determine the}} optimum parameters (i. e., the process mean and process variance) of the <b>input</b> <b>characteristic</b> in the transformation model. In Huang’s transformation model, the <b>input</b> <b>characteristic,</b> x, {{is assumed to be}} normally distributed and the output characteristic, y, is nominal-the-best with a target value. The relationship between x and y can be either linear or quadratic. When formulating the cost function in the transformation model, Huang used the symmetric quadratic loss function to measure the loss of profit. In this paper, we extend Huang’s quadratic transformation model to a more general case by respectively using asymmetric quadratic and asymmetric linear loss functions in the cost function. The modified cost functions using asymmetric quadratic and asymmetric linear loss functions are developed. A numerical example is provided for illustration...|$|E
40|$|Lijphart’s {{spectrum}} of democracies – recently expanded by Jack Nagel to a sub-majoritarian sphere of pluralitarian systems which use disproportional electoral systems {{in order to}} manufacture majority governments from minorities in the electorate – is based on only one dimension: inclusion of preferences. Political scientists in the Lijphartian tradition wrongly assume that inclusion of preferences, which is an <b>input</b> <b>characteristic,</b> automatically leads to responsiveness, which refers to actual policy decisions and hence is an output characteristic. We therefore add ‘responsibility’ as a second <b>input</b> <b>characteristic</b> and employ it alongside the inclusiveness of institutional regimes. We argue that in representative democracies there exists a trade-off between inclusiveness and responsibility. This trade-off helps us to measure the democratic quality of institutional regimes. The now expanded {{spectrum of}} democracies based on these two dimensions shows that majoritarian democracy proper – in which governments represent a majority of individual preferences {{but not more than}} necessary – is the best possible combination of the two democratic values...|$|E

The large-signal BCM averaged switch model shows that several BCM converters with input voltage feedforward exhibit resistive or nearly resistive <b>input</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which is well suited for realization of power factor correctors.

40|$|Memory {{management}} {{is a critical}} issue in stream processing involving stateful operators such as join. Traditionally, the memory requirement for a stream join is query-driven: a query has to explicitly define a window for each (potentially unbounded) input. The window essentially bounds {{the size of the}} buffer allocated for that stream. However, outputs produced by such approach may not be desirable (if the window size {{is not part of the}} intended query semantic) due to the volatile <b>input</b> <b>characteristics.</b> We discover that when streams are ordered or partially ordered, it is possible to use a data-driven memory management scheme for improved performance. In this work, we present a novel data-driven memory management scheme, called Window-Oblivious Join (WO-Join), which adaptively adjusts the state buffer size according to the <b>input</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Our performance study shows that, compared to traditional Window-Join (W-Join), WO-Join is more robust with respect to the dynamic inputs and therefore produces higher quality results with lower memory costs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{efficient}} learning method for the layered neural networks {{based on the}} selection of training data and <b>input</b> <b>characteristics</b> of an output layer unit. The multilayer neural network is widely used due to its simple structure.

Focusing on the input data during the learning stage, we undertook an experiment to identify the data that makes large errors and interferes with the learning process. Our method devides the learning process into several stages. In general, <b>input</b> <b>characteristics</b> to an output layer unit show oscillation during learning process for complicated problems.
