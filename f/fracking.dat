5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (<b>fracking)</b> {{for natural gas}} production could have caused or contributed to the quake. There were not any <b>fracking</b> operations in Virginia {{at the time of}} the quake. The nearest <b>fracking</b> was occurring in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by <b>fracking</b> and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E

The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes {{in the fight against}} HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam.

5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by <b>fracking.</b> Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E

25|$|Josh {{was born}} in 1972 and lived in Milanville, Pennsylvania. He {{attended}} Columbia University and graduated in 1995, majoring in Theater and studying with Anne Bogart and Edward Tayler. In 2008, Josh campaigned for Barack Obama’s presidential run and soon after, Josh’s family was offered $100,000 {{in order to allow}} a natural gas <b>fracking</b> company to use his land in northern Pennsylvania. Curious of the situation, Josh set out {{to learn more about the}} <b>fracking</b> industry. After learning the truth behind some of the natural gas company's false positive claims, Josh went on a mission to uncover them further, crossing the country visiting other <b>fracking</b> areas and seeing their drinking water conditions, birthing Josh’s anti-fracking activism.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Government {{states that}} it is taking a cautious, {{considered}} and evidenced-based approach to <b>fracking.</b> In January 2015 the Scottish Government placed a moratorium on granting consents for unconventional oil and gas extraction.

The Scottish Government has stated that no <b>fracking</b> can or will take place in Scotland while the moratorium remains in place.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Energy Policy Act {{was passed}} by Congress, which {{exempted}} hydraulic fracturing from the regulations defined in the Safe Drinking Water Act, except where it involved the injection of diesel fuel.
