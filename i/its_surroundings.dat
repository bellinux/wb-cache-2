The deciduous forests provide habitats for songbirds, such as scarlet tanager and red-eyed vireo.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings,</b> and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|Beato {{was very}} active while in Japan. In 1865 he {{produced}} a number of dated views of Nagasaki and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings.</b> From 1866 he was often caricatured in Japan Punch, which was founded and edited by Wirgman. In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and many, perhaps all, of his negatives.|$|E

5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view <b>its</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Tyldesley and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings</b> have {{provided}} {{evidence for the}} remains of a Roman road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington, until the Norman conquest of England, when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Felice Beato {{left the}} {{partnership}} of Robertson & Beato, though Robertson retained {{use of the}} name until 1867. Beato was sent from India to photograph the Anglo-French military expedition to China in the Second Opium War. He arrived in Hong Kong in March and immediately began photographing the city and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings</b> as far as Canton. Beato's photographs {{are some of the}} earliest taken in China.|$|E

5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds.

5|$|Oscars {{will often}} {{lay claim to}} {{an area of the}} {{aquarium}} and will be very aggressive towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside the aquarium or lake.

5|$|Too little {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero.

5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into <b>its</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 5–6 November, {{fighting}} died down after a ceasefire was brokered in The Hague. The lull {{was used by the}} 137th Infantry Brigade to extract its encircled troops and civilians near the Korana River, east of Malići. The JNA column began moving south again at dawn; it reached Malići at about 9:00a.m., crossed the Korana River (over the village bridge and a pontoon bridge) by 11:00 and proceeded to Vojnić. Shortly afterwards, the Logorište barracks and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings</b> were secured by the HV.|$|E
5|$|Following the NDH's establishment, Đujić {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Ustaše. As {{early as}} April, Đujić's Chetnik's began killing and mutilating Croats {{in retaliation for}} the wave of Ustaše atrocities against Serb communities across the NDH around the same time. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month, centered mainly around Knin. By mid-month, his Chetniks were launching raids against communist-held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians, who considered him a filibuster. His Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings,</b> sparing the local Serb population from further massacres.|$|E
5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and <b>its</b> <b>surroundings</b> fled to Serbia or were {{deported}} to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year the Nuremberg trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, partly out {{of a desire to}} remain near the graves of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
