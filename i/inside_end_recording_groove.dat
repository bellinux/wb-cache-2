The Stereolab album Transient Random Noise Bursts With Announcements ends with the song [...] "Lock Groove Lullaby" [...] which, as the name suggests, extends into the locked groove. Nail by Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel (1985) features a <b>recorded</b> lock <b>groove</b> on the final song ("Anything") which results in the final note of the album slowly repeating itself. Portugal. The Man's 2008 album Censored Colors contains a locked groove at {{the end of the}} first disc repeating the words [...] "turn me over."

50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> {{to cancel}} out the distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, which could not track the <b>record</b> <b>groove</b> accurately in the high frequencies, especially in the inner grooves of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this pre-distortion became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|R
50|$|A smooth-tipped stylus (in popular usage {{often called}} a needle {{due to the}} former use of steel needles for the purpose) is used to play the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove.</b> A special chisel-like stylus is used to engrave the groove into the master record.|$|R

50|$|In {{a moving}} magnet cartridge, the stylus {{cantilever}} carries a tiny permanent magnet, which is positioned between {{two sets of}} fixed coils (in a stereophonic cartridge), forming a tiny electromagnetic generator. As the magnet vibrates {{in response to the}} stylus following the <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> it induces a tiny current in the coils.|$|R
50|$|In a {{phonograph}} reproducer, {{the diaphragm}} is a flat disk of typically mica isinglass that converts the mechanical vibration imparted on the buttress from the <b>recorded</b> <b>groove</b> into sound.

50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and <b>record</b> <b>groove.</b> At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} hit single {{to have a}} <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> is [...] "Muskrat Love" [...] by Captain & Tennille. A few years later, in December 1975, a British artist known as Chris Hill did a {{break-in}} record (see Dickie Goodman or Bill Buchanan) called, [...] "Renta Santa" [...] on Philips 6006-491 that included a <b>recorded</b> locked <b>groove</b> {{at the end of}} the side.|$|R

40|$|Insertion {{sequence}} 50 (IS 50) transposition utilizes a 19 -base-pair "outside" end and a 19 -base-pair "inside" end in inverted orientation {{relative to}} each other, whereas transposon 5 (Tn 5) transposition utilizes two inverted outside ends. The frequency of transposition events that involve an <b>inside</b> <b>end</b> is regulated 1000 -fold by the host dam methylase system. The end sequence requirements for transposition and its regulation by dam methylase were analyzed in Escherichia coli by generating random single base pair mutations in either an IS 50 <b>inside</b> <b>end</b> or outside end placed in inverted orientation {{with respect to}} an unmutagenized outside end. The mutations were then isolated, assayed for transposition phenotype, and sequenced. Mutations were isolated at 15 of the 19 sites in the outside end. All of these mutations except those at position 4 decreased transposition. Mutations at position 4 (which is the only nonidentical base pair in a region of homology between the outside and <b>inside</b> <b>ends)</b> {{had no effect on}} transposition. Mutations were isolated at 11 of the 19 sites in the <b>inside</b> <b>end.</b> All of these mutations, including one at position 4, decreased transposition in dam- cells. Mutations at position 10 (within a dam recognition sequence) and 2 (not within a dam recognition sequence) reduced the magnitude of dam regulation. A mutation within a dam recognition sequence adjacent to the required 19 base pairs of the <b>inside</b> <b>end</b> did not reduce the magnitude of dam regulation...|$|R

50|$|A new stylus {{invented by}} Keller made {{possible}} the first high-fidelity musical recordings after he worked with sound engineer, Irad S. Rafuse. Their ideas led the way for single-groove stereo records when they proposed recording two sound channels on a master disk. On April 19, 1938, Keller was issued US patent number 2,114,471 for his idea of recording the two channels of a stereo recording in one <b>record</b> <b>groove,</b> each at 45 degrees from vertical.|$|R
50|$|Phono cartridges, {{also known}} as pickups, are {{electromechanical}} devices which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the <b>record's</b> <b>groove.</b> In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.|$|R
