500|$|A San Francisco Chronicle {{review of}} a 2012 concert judged her singing [...] "an {{impressive}} thing to witness, and Evancho's technical precision and enormous range only serve {{to make it seem}} less fluky", but felt that [...] "every selection sounded alike". A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of being a kid soprano, a true phenomenon. People pay a lot to see you and orchestras line up to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> their stage. But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary." [...] In 2013, an Atlanta reviewer commented: [...] "Her pure and well-formed vowel sounds touched the hearts of everyone at the concert." [...] A review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called Evancho [...] "awesomely talented" [...] and [...] "technically flawless". The Buffalo News reviewer wrote: [...] "there is a poignancy to the sound of this mature voice coming out of this child. Her high notes are a joy." ...|$|E
500|$|Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra {{gave the}} album two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars and was underwhelmed with the {{production}} for sounding like his previous recordings. He recognized that Miguel was capable of handling love songs because of his [...] "rich, deep voice" [...] highlighting [...] "Tu Mirada", [...] "Soy Yo", and [...] "O Tú o Ninguna" [...] as examples. However, Guerra felt that Miguel [...] "runs into trouble" [...] on the dance tracks as he did on his prior albums. He chided [...] "Sol, Arena y Mar" [...] for its [...] "tepid mix of blaring horns and uninspired lyrics" [...] and said the other uptempo songs [...] "don't fare any better"; he criticized the over usage of horns on every fast-paced track as [...] "dated" [...] and [...] "repetitive". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote a more positive review of the album. He complimented [...] "Te Propongo Esta Noche" [...] and lauded the ballads such as [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] and [...] "Ese Momento" [...] as [...] "sensual and solemn". Tarradell closed his review by calling Amartes Es un Placer an [...] "enjoyable balance between high-brow ballads and hardwood workouts". Miami Herald editor Leila Cobo was disappointed with the record. She noted that while Miguel's vocals are still [...] "dazzling", the production sounds [...] "dated". She found [...] "Tú, Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "Dímelo en un Beso" [...] to be [...] "discoish duds that lack the oomph to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the dance floor". Cobo also commented the tracks suffer {{from a lack of}} [...] "strong hooks or melodies" [...] despite Miguel having the ability to [...] "elevate pretty much any style". Even so, Cobo praised [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] for its [...] "few memorable lyrics" [...] and [...] "No Me Fío" [...] for its arrangements.|$|E

2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men.

2500|$|He was a {{main part}} of Barcelona's treble and scored the fourth goal in the 4–1 win in the 2009 Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao, with a free kick. In La Liga, among many games, {{one of the most}} {{significant}} is the 6–2 Clásico victory over Real Madrid on 2 May; he assisted four out of six goals (once to Carles Puyol, once to Thierry Henry and twice to Lionel Messi). Xavi helped Barcelona win the 2009 Champions League final 2–0 against Manchester United, assisting the second goal by crossing to Messi for his header. Prior to the match, Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson heaped praise on the much lauded central midfield combination of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, stating, [...] "I don't think Xavi and Iniesta have ever given the ball away in their lives. They <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> that carousel and they can leave you dizzy." [...] Xavi was voted [...] "UEFA Champions League best midfielder" [...] for his contribution during Barcelona's victorious 2008–09 Champions League campaign. Xavi was La Liga's highest assisting player with 20 assists. He was also the highest assisting player in the Champions League with seven assists. Xavi earned 29 assists overall that season.|$|E
2500|$|Filming Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949) [...] was, {{according}} to Williams in her autobiography, {{an experience of}} [...] "pure misery". A period musical starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, the two male leads character's were [...] players in a baseball team owned by K.C. Higgins, Williams's role. She claimed that Kelly and co-writer Stanley Donen treated her with contempt and {{went out of their}} way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest earning film of the year. Williams made Neptune's Daughter (also 1949) around the same time with co-stars Ricardo Montalbán, Red Skelton and Betty Garrett, who had also been in Take Me Out to the Ball Game. [...] In the film, Williams sings [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Montalbán. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 22nd Academy Awards. Williams and Montalbán were originally slated to sing [...] "(I'd Like to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> a) Slow Boat to China", but studio censors thought the song was too sexual (interpreting the word [...] "get" [...] as [...] "have") and instead gave them [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside." [...] Neptune's Daughter became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1949.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Close's forthright views {{had never}} been welcome at Lord's and the affable Colin Cowdrey {{returned}} to lead the M.C.C. tour of the West Indies in 1967–68. It was here that Snow really made his mark in international cricket. Although he was not picked for the first test, which was drawn, Snow {{had the advantage of}} being fully acclimatised by the Second Test. He took 7/49 at Jamaica, [...] including in his haul the opener Steve Camacho, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers (lbw for another first ball duck), Basil Butcher, David Holford, Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall as the West Indies were scuttled for 143. Rioting interrupted play when the crowd objected to Butcher's dismissal, even though he walked. Riot police and tear gas were used to restore order and the incident allowed the West Indies team to recover their poise against the now unsettled tourists. They made 391 following on (Snow 1/91) and England were reduced to 68/8 {{at the end of the}} last day, which was played before an empty stadium. Sobers decided to bat on a flat wicket at Barbados, [...] but Snow (5/80) restricted them to 349. England made 449 and the home team batted out the game with 284/6, Snow claiming 3/39. Ironically England won the series at Trinidad with no help from Snow (0/68 and 1/29) thanks to a sporting declaration by Gary Sobers giving England two and three quarter hours to make 215 for victory, which they did for the loss of three wickets with three minutes to spare. Snow finished the series with 4/84 and 6/60 in Guyana, [...] his 10/144 being his best Test figures and his only 10-wicket haul. Even so, England barely survived; 209–9 at stumps on the last day and staring defeat in the face as Gary Sobers (3/53) and Lance Gibbs (6/60) whirred through the overs. Snow played his part lasting 60 balls and 45 minutes before he was out for 1 on the last evening. Rohan Kanhai had repeatedly told him in 1966 that [...] "We'll smash you all over the park when we <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> those wickets in the Caribbean", but Snow had taken 27 wickets (18.66) in four tests. This remains the most wickets taken by an England bowler in a series in the West Indies, though it was equalled by Angus Fraser in 1997–98 when he took 27 wickets (18.22) in six tests. Snow was instrumental in England's second series victory in the Caribbean, and they would have to wait 36 years for the next.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
