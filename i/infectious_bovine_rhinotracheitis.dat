5000|$|The {{disease may}} be {{complicated}} by concurrent infection with viruses such as <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus (bovine herpesvirus 1) or adenovirus, bacteria such as Mycoplasma boviculi or Listeria monocytogenes, or infestation by Thelazia, a nematode.|$|E
50|$|Alphaherpesvirinae is a {{subfamily}} of Herpesviridae, primarily {{distinguished by}} reproducing {{more quickly than}} other subfamilies of Herpesviridae. In animal virology the most important herpesviruses belong to the Alphaherpesvirinae. Pseudorabies virus is the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease in pigs and bovine herpesvirus 1 is the causative agent of <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> and pustular vulvovaginitis. Mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 37 species in this subfamily, divided among 5 genera. Diseases associated with this subfamily include: HHV-1 and HHV-2: skin vesicles or mucosal ulcers, rarely encephalitis and meningitis HHV-3: chickenpox (varicella) and shingles gaHV-2: Marek's disease.|$|R
50|$|In animal virology, {{the most}} {{important}} herpesviruses belong to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Research on pseudorabies virus (PrV), the causative agent of Aujeszkys disease in pigs, has pioneered animal disease control with genetically modified vaccines. PrV is now extensively studied {{as a model for}} basic processes during lytic herpesvirus infection, and for unraveling molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus neurotropism, whereas bovine herpesvirus 1, the causative agent of <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> and pustular vulvovaginitis, is analyzed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of latency. The avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus is phylogenetically distant from these two viruses and serves to underline similarity and diversity within the Alphaherpesvirinae.|$|R
40|$|Twelve slow-growing virus {{isolates}} propagated in {{tissue culture}} from cattle with epididymitis and vaginitis {{were identified as}} herpes viruses {{by virtue of their}} biological, physicochemical and morphological characteristics. None of the 12 virus strains proved to be serologically related to the <b>infectious</b> pustular vulvo-vaginitis-infectious <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> (IPV-IBR) virus, but a further 3 strains included in this study were identical with IPV-IBR virus. Three of the slow-growing virus strains caused a mild anterior vaginitis when deposited in the vagina of heifers. A pool of 10 slow-growing viruses plus a strain of IPV-IBR virus produced anterior and posterior vaginitis in a heifer.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of supplemental dietary chromium (Cr) on antibody responses of feedlot calves. Fifty-five newly weaned calves were divided into two groups, 28 that received supplemental Cr and 27 that did not, and were immunized with a commercial vaccine against <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus (IBR) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI- 3). Sera harvested from blood sampled preimmunization, and at days 14 and 28 postimmunization (PI), were assayed for anti-IBR and anti-PI- 3 antibody titers. Individual calves were also scored as seroconverters if day 14 or 28 PI titers were > or = 3 times the value of the preimmunization titer. Thirty-five calves did not seroconvert to either antigen. Of 20 IBR seroconverters, 15 calves were from the Cr-supplemented group while only five calves were controls (p = 0. 007). There was no treatment difference in the number of PI- 3 seroconverters. Least squares analysis of actual antibody titers revealed that Cr supplementation increased the magnitude of the peak antibody response to the IBR (p = 0. 003), but had no effect on anti-PI- 3 antibody titers. These data confirmed and extended our previous observations that supplemental Cr can be immunomodulatory in cattle...|$|R

Passive immunity decreased to near zero over {{the first six months of}} life for both bovine virus diarrhea and <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> controls. All calves seroconverted to bovine virus diarrhea vaccine at 84 days of age, even though high levels (greater than 1 : 32) of maternal antibodies were present. These calves did not seroconvert to <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> vaccine at 84 days of age when high levels (less than 1 : 16) of maternal antibodies were present. Calves responded well to bovine virus diarrhea and <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> vaccines given only once at 196 days of age after passive immunity disappeared. Calves which were revaccinated with <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> seroconverted showing a more rapid response than the single vaccinates.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was developed}} to detect bovine serum antibody to <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus.

40|$|An electrophoretic {{analysis}} of radioactively labeled, purified, "empty" and DNA-containing <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virions revealed {{the presence of}} 25 to 33 structural (virion) polypeptides. A total of 11 of these polypeptides could be labeled with [3 H]glucosamine and were identified as glycoproteins. In addition to the 25 structural polypeptides, <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus infected cells also contained at least 15 nonstructural (nonvirion) polypeptides that were not present in purified virions. Expression of the viral polypeptides in infected cells was controlled temporally. Thus, most viral polypeptides could be categorized as "alpha" (immediate early), "beta" (early), or "gamma" (late) {{on the basis of}} their order of appearance in infected cells and whether their syntheses were dependent upon prior viral protein or DNA synthesis. None of the glycoproteins belongs to the alpha class, although at least one (GVP 11) was synthesized in the absence of viral DNA synthesis.

40|$|Ewes (N = 7) {{and their}} lambs (N = 12) were vaccinated with a {{commercial}} modified live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis-parainfluenza type 3 virus vaccine. Both the vaccinated ewes and lambs {{and a group}} of unvaccinated ewes (N = 8) and their lambs (N = 13) were subsequently challenged with virulent parainfluenza type 3 virus. Although absolute immunity to infection and clinical response was not conferred, the clinical response was less severe in vaccinated lambs. Vaccinated animals also shed parainfluenza type 3 virus in nasal secretions for a shorter time than nonvaccinated animals. Some vaccinated lambs developed a persistent <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>rhinotracheitis</b> virus infection that was recrudesced by treatment with dexamethasone.
