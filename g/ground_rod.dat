50|$|In {{areas with}} {{high-resistance}} soil, {{the resistance of}} the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing the <b>grounding</b> <b>rod</b> to float to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> to be extra deep.Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is high-resistance.|$|R

Experimental data for voltages and currents at various locations in the runway lighting system due to direct lightning strikes are presented along with the causative lightning current.

Since normal circuit currents in the neutral conductor can lead to objectionable or dangerous differences between local earth potential and the neutral, and to protect against neutral breakages, special precautions such as frequent rodding down to earth (multiple <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> connections), use of cables where the combined neutral and earth completely surrounds the phase conductor(s), and thicker than normal equipotential bonding must be considered to ensure the system is safe.|$|E

40|$|A test {{technique}} {{was developed to}} assess various grounding system concepts used for mobile facilities. The {{test technique}} involves applying a high current pulse to the grounding system with the proper waveshape and magnitude to simulate a lightning return stroke. Of concern were the step voltages present along the ground near the point of lightning strike. Step voltage is equated to how fast the current pulse is dissipated by the grounding system. The applied current pulse was produced by a high current capacitor bank with a total energy content of 80 kilojoules. A series of pulse tests were performed on two types of mobile facility grounding systems.

40|$|In the {{grounding}} {{systems with}} a two layers soil, {{the calculation of}} the surface potential using the image method is sometimes impossible due to singularities, avoiding researchers to use the method for electrodes in the bottom layer. In the literature this problem solution is refereed as unreliable or solved with other more complex methods. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} calculate the surface potentials in a two. layer soil, for electrodes in the bottom layer, when images are at surface. The singularities in computing surface voltage, when the first image upwards lies at surface, are analysed and it's shown that a small change in top layer thickness allows an approximate solution. Surface potentials due to grid conductor are also considered and the values of resistance are compared with those from other methodologies. Singularities for a <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> that crosses the two layers are also treated. The obtained values of resistance are not satisfactory, due to lower segments images that overlap the upper segments.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the backflashover {{phenomenon}} in HV overhead transmission lines (TLs) with towers grounded by means of long counterpoises, typically used in high resistivity soils. Although long counterpoises are effective in reducing the grounding impedance at power frequency, their impulse response may affect negatively the TL backflashover rate. The study {{is focused on the}} enhancement of TL lightning performance obtainable by adding a small number of vertical <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> to horizontal counterpoises. An extensive ATP-EMTP parametric analysis, based on a detailed 161 kVTL model including the leader progression model (LPM) of line insulations and the non-linear transient behaviour of grounding systems, has been carried out taking into account several different values of soil resistivity as well as varying numbers, locations and lengths of additional vertical rods. Critical lightning current ranges causing backflashover have been then predicted for several lightning waveforms, of different severity. The paper shows that the addition of a few vertical <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> significantly improves TL lightning performance by increasing critical lightning current values. even if their influence is negligible at power frequency. The authors have ascertained an increment of average critical backflashover current up to similar to 55 % for some typical TL grounding system configurations and lightning waveshapes.
