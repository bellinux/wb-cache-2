40|$|This study {{examines}} the changing roles of <b>heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> {{by focusing on}} the participatory practices of intangible urban heritage. Developments towards democratisation in the heritage sector led to a growing expectation that <b>heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> would work with local publics. This democratisation is manifested in (1) the use of digital media for grassroots heritage practices, (2) the broader scope of what is defined as heritage, and (3) a focus on communities in UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural <b>Heritage.</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> are thus challenged to develop inclusive heritage practices, particularly in cities, which are characterised by a dynamic nature and cultural diversity. In this article, I analyse how urban <b>heritage</b> organisations and <b>professionals</b> have responded to these developments. Drawing on interviews and a qualitative content analysis of these organisations’ policy documents, I examine the ways in which <b>heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> reconsider their public role through what I define as networked practices of intangible heritage. This concept captures the networked structure in which <b>heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> increasingly work, and also demonstrates how heritage is given meaning through public practices that take place in both the physical and virtual realms of contemporary cities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Underwater {{treasure}} {{hunting is}} a rampant and concerning problem for marine archaeology {{and the future}} of underwater cultural <b>heritage.</b> <b>Professional</b> and small-time operations survey the ocean floors for valuable historical artifacts which they proceed to collect with little to no understanding of archaeological methods or caution for preservation of context. The artifacts they take often end up in a private collection, sold or given to investors, and dispersed throughout the world. In this way information is lost, history is not preserved and our common cultural heritage is destroyed. The archaeological community highly condemns association with underwater treasure hunters and salvage companies and for understandable reasons. However, it is the belief of the author that salvage companies are not just an annoying fly that can be dismissed by the underwater archaeology community. Rather this relationship is an ongoing and pressing issue that must be dealt with by professional archaeologists. This paper looks into ways of dealing with this issue that respects the concerns of both sides. It examines the history of the issue and how it has come to this point. Finally, the author proposes a program, set up and maintained by individual states for persons/organizations who wish to obtain their salvage license. This program would train potential treasure hunters in the ethics and methods of underwater archaeology in the hope of preventing that loss of material and historical culture...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarise}} findings from collaborative research with Sheffield City Council to help contribute to a national healthy walks initiative. The primary purpose of the initiative is to help encourage a more active lifestyle through the uptake of regular walking. Highlighted here are some of the Sheffield urban walks which aimed to engage specifically with those living in more deprived urban communities. Reawakening the participants’ sense of enquiry and motivation to explore their everyday historic urban surroundings was an important stage in increasing the potential sustainable impact of the walking programme. Design/methodology/approach – The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded project used an Action Research/collaborative approach to help develop the English Heritage GIS tool (Historic Landscape Characterisation) as both a catalyst for exploring the temporality of space and as a practical desk-based means for defining potential walking routes. Findings – The healthy walking initiative is used to illustrate how cross-domain working can provide a powerful means to engage new audiences and it is asserted here that any form of community walking has the potential to increase the sense of custodianship of place. Originality/value – (Re) awakening of attachment is explored here through engagement with an embedded and everyday material time-depth. There are many urban residential areas which are not formally addressed by the urban designer, landscape architect, conservation officer or <b>heritage</b> <b>professional</b> and so require the engaged citizen to recognise the potential impacts of incremental change upon their surroundings. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} origins and {{rationale}} of two categories of house museum - here named "Great Man" and "Social History" - in the United States and Australia. An examination of cultural, social and historical change provides the context for the genres' evolution. The Great Man genre was born in mid nineteenth-century America when two houses associated with George Washington - Hasbrouck House and Mount Vernon - were preserved and translated to museum status. Mount Vernon quickly became the exemplar for house museums. Civil religion, a secular nationalism that adopted the forms and rituals of church religion, focusing on hero worship, pilgrimage and contemplation of transcendent collective purpose, provided the ideology that sustained the new museum type. Great Man house museums became the shrines at which such rituals could be practiced. In the early twentieth-century the specialization of heritage organizations encouraged a new breed of <b>heritage</b> <b>professional.</b> Largely fabric focused, these "new museum men" influenced philosophy, management and conservation practice at house museums throughout the century. Social history made its impact upon house museums in the latter decades of the twentieth century. The paradigm encouraged {{the creation of a new}} category of house museum. Existing Great Man house museums adopted some of its characteristics though never lost their hero worship foundations. In fact, I posit that the idea of hero worship was transferred to the new genre. The birth and evolution of the two categories of house museum is demonstrated through four biographical studies: Vaucluse House in Sydney; Monticello in Charlottesville VA; the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City; and Susannah Place Museum in Sydney. I believe the findings demonstrate an argument that applies at hundreds of house museums in the United States and Australia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{literature}} {{search of the}} topics new technologies, innovation, conservation, restoration and heritage, will reveal an abundance of articles and publications on these subjects: some cover discussions on the progress that has resulted from implementing one or more technological components into cultural <b>heritage</b> <b>professional</b> and research practices, whilst others simply offer descriptions of new devices, how they operate, and their potential applications. Few, if any, explore what happens when formal academic training is completed and job hunting begins, when essentially the infrastructure and support offered by the university or institution is no longer readily available for research purposes. If professionals need {{to make use of}} the university's services and expertise after having graduated, they will incur significant costs. Logically, many try to avoid these costs, but then find themselves lacking the expertise required for the project to run smoothly from the get go, or shelving studies entirely because they cannot secure sufficient funding to pay for this expertise or other associated resources. In order to address this issue and help university graduates in the field of cultural heritage conservation and restoration overcome such challenges once they graduate, a detailed study was performed aimed at establishing how to introduce students to ICT and LKT (Learning and Knowledge Technologies) content and training that specifically relate to the needs of practicing professionals in this field, and thus increase their autonomy upon graduation. As such, the study covers two elements: firstly, the direct and real applications of hardware and software available to the professional conservator-restorer in the field of cultural heritage conservation and restoration, and secondly, their role in the training of future professionals in this field. With regards to the first element - the practical applications of current hardware and software - we first had to compile a comprehensive list that detailed: available physical devices; compatible software and applications together with their descriptions; and the field applications of said devices. We then had to produce technical reports that detail the correct use and implementation of said devices. These reports were produced having first performed the necessary data collection and testing. With regards to the second element - the training of students – we attempted to address the demand for multidisciplinary work in the field of cultural heritage conservation and restoration. More often than not, higher educational degrees of this type do not offer students training regarding multidisciplinary collaboration, nor how to maximize its potential through the use of appropriate methodologies. As such, this study explores how different content could be taught using pre-existing subjects belonging to different degree programmes. Students also receive training in the use of new technologies, and experience innovative teaching techniques as a result of the inclusion of these state-of-the-art tools in the classroom. Teaching and learning is optimized via the use of virtual tools, collaborative online/offline tasks, as well as problem-based learning strategies (PBL). During the training period, the collaborative work that is required of the students and the problem-based learning tasks they perform are very much aimed at addressing the demand for multidisciplinary work in this field...|$|E
40|$|We try, in this thesis, to {{exemplify the}} Izumino plan with an intent {{to improve our}} {{educational}} practice chiefly in elementary and high schools. This plan seems rather unknown in other countries, deserving, however, higher evaluation {{for the reason that}} its central theme is training of a young teacher and the teacher himself or herself should be one of the influential moments of educational improvement. The Izumino plan is so called as it was brought into use at Izumino, a small village {{at the foot of the}} Yatsugatake mountainous area, Shinshu. Its founder was Shogo Fujimori (1885 - 1945), the schoolmaster of the village school. He was born at Suwa and, after graduating the middle school there, became an unqualified elementary school teacher. There he was deeply influenced by two eminent teachers, Moriya and Kubota, and definitely determined to become a good teacher. He entranced the Nagano Normal School at 1908 and the next year became a regular teacher. After serving at several schools, he was appointed the school-master of the Izumino school. There he remained and served about fifteen years (1928 - 1943). This plan was originally called Fujimori's plan of three kinds study for a teacher, and he became famous with this plan. According to the plan, Izumino's teacher should train himself as follows. The first year is the preparation period. He should teach his pupils as if he is a student-teacher in his college days. Everyday, Fujimori used to visit his class, criticize his lesson and guide how to teach. From the second year to the seventh, he is to get up early morning and read some one of Chinese or Japanese classics. Then, at school, he serves as a teacher devotedly and, before leaving school, he should have completed preparation for the next day's lesson, so he goes home without bag. In the evening, at home, he should study any learning, e. g. philosophy, mathematics, history, and so on. In short, his time-table is divided into three kinds: studying of our cultural <b>heritage,</b> <b>professional</b> study and that of any scientific learning. When he finished seven years at Izumino, he was in general an excellent teacher, man of consciousness and learning. We may draw some generalizations from the study above. 1) How should an ideal teacher be? In the first place, a good teacher should be a good pupil at the same time, i. e. have his own lifelong teacher. This was a truth in our cultural tradition, now is, and will be in future. Then, he should have a strong passion toward truth throughout his life. And then, he should be man of high mission in education, lover of commonness, and man of courage and backbone. How can such a teacher be made? The sincere teaching practice is the most fundamental, and how he live in his young days as a novice will have a definite influence upon his life as a teacher. 2) How should a young teacher live? A teacher's professional life, after college graduation until retirement, counts forty years or so. It has three periods. The first is seven or eight years long, from graduation to about thirty years old, and the period of "novice". The second is from thirty to forty-five, full of activities and self-reliance. The last is that of wisdom. The first period, we think, is that of teacher's skelton-making. So a young teacher, should, above all, devote himself to teaching and get a pure sentiment of pleasure and satisfaction. Then he will realize what education is. In the meantime, he inevitably faces many difficult problems, so, in the second place, he should begin to study some of Chinese and Japanese classics, our most precious cultural heritage, and any field of learning. His object of studying learning is not to become a scholar but to be a true teacher, of course. He may choose any learning, e. g. philosophy, literature, history and so on, but should read books of originality and of top level. They may be difficult to read. They, moreover, may seem useless to his profession directly, but don't mind thereof. He is in skelton-making, and human skelton is always out of sight. Its significance can't be doubted...|$|E

An analysis of their responses to an on-line questionnaire and of the information from semi-structured interviews is presented in this paper. It reveals that among all the existing issues and debates such as the question of the (un) equal representation by geographical region and category and the question of indefinite expansion of the World <b>Heritage</b> List, <b>heritage</b> <b>professionals</b> were also concerned with the phenomenon of the evident growth in popularity of World Heritage among tourists and the issues related to balancing conservation and tourism at existing World Heritage Sites...|$|R
