40|$|Abstract. This work {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of an infrared thermal NDE procedure for the evaluation of subsurface defects. The approach is called Pulse-Modulated Lock-In Thermography (PMLT) and is based on the analysis of the frequency response of the measured temperature and comparison with the carrier frequencies launched by the external heat delivering source. The heat deposited on the object is in particular modulated as a train of square waves. This is easily achieved by periodically shuttering the heat source. The temperature is then sampled throughout the deposition of a few square waves. A lock-in algorithm is then implemented able to selectively filter out components at the main carrier frequencies of the heating signal and evaluate the phase information. Defected areas at different depths can be marked based on phase contrast, by using data from a single experiment as in Pulsed-Phase Thermography. An artificially defected thick <b>GRP</b> <b>panel</b> typical of naval monolithic hull structures, is investigated to validate the proposed technique. Experimental data have confirmed the potentials of PMLT as a flexible IR NDT approach, and its ability to be implemented by means of low cost heating and IR equipments. ...|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{composite}} materials, particularly {{glass reinforced}} plastics (GRP), are increasingly {{being used in the}} offshore industry and their behaviour in fire is studied using mathematical and numerical modelling. A generalised finite element method is developed to analyse the thermally induced response of a widely used GRP, consisting of polyester resin and glass fibre reinforcement. <b>GRP</b> <b>panels,</b> pipes and joins subject to hydrocarbon fires (i. e. high temperatures) are studied. One- and two-dimensional mathematical models are developed to study the fire performance of: (i) single-skinned <b>GRP</b> <b>panels,</b> (ii) twin-skinned GRP-Vermiculux sandwich panels, and (iii) thin and thick <b>GRP</b> joins (step <b>panels).</b> The models involve thermochemical decomposition of the material (pyrolysis) and include: (i) transient heat conduction, (ii) gas mass movement and internal heat convection of pyrolysis gases, (iii) mass loss and Arrhenius rate decomposition of the resin material into gases and char, and (iv) endothermicity of pyrolysis. The effect of imperfect bonding on heat transfer in sandwich panels and the accumulation of pyrolysis gases and internal pressurisation in thick step panels are also included. The models may be used with any combination of steady or time-dependent boundary conditions including temperature, radiation, chemical reactions, mass diffusion and free and forced convections. Various positions of panels, i. e. vertical, horizontal and inclined are studied. The material is assumed homogeneous and orthotropic with respect to thermal and transport properties which may vary with temperature, pore pressure and moisture. The finite element models use weighted residual approach with linear elements for one- dimensional and quadrilateral elements for two-dimensional. Non-linear terms and coefficients are evaluated explicitly using an iterative-updating method and nodal temperatures and pore pressures implicitly using Crank-Nicolson solution. The classical finite difference time stepping algorithm is used where an efficient solution is achieved using variable time step. Numerical results are presented in the form of temperature versus time, temperature versus distance, pore pressure versus distance, mass loss versus distance and moisture versus distance and compared with experimental data where available. It is shown that the decomposition of the material, endothermicity of pyrolysis and the movement of pyrolysis gases make substantial contributions towards the cooling behaviour and delaying the bum-through. The effect of gas mass movement and surface chemical reactions across the boundary layer adjacent to the fire-exposed surface is very important in introducing a theoretical boundary condition. An investigation into the effect of inclusion the variable thermal properties reveals considerable improvement in thermal predictions. Sandwich panels consisting of GRP/Vermiculux/GRP offer good thermal insulation. Thermal contact resistance at an imperfect bonding is important where an average difference of 12 % can be found between the thermal responses of sandwich panels with perfect and imperfect bonding. For thin <b>GRP</b> step <b>panels,</b> a one-dimensional solution is found adequate to predict the fire resistance behaviour of the material. For thick <b>GRP</b> step <b>panels,</b> the effect of internal pressurisation coupled with temperature on the thermal response is considerable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSix {{water mist}} {{suppression}} experiments {{were conducted in}} an ISO 9705 size room lined with <b>GRP</b> <b>panels</b> with a small wooden crib as a fire initiation source. A four-nozzle water mist suppression system was used to extinguish the fires. Heat release rate (HRR) from the fires was measured, as well as: room temperature; wall surface temperature of <b>GRP</b> <b>panels,</b> and; heat flux to the wall at specific locations within the room. The concentration of oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide was also measured {{in one corner of}} the room. It was found that the mist suppression method used was an effective system for extinguishing fires from 500 kW – 1. 5 MW in magnitude. However, in one experiment in which only a single, centrally located nozzle was used the fire could not be completely extinguished. The GRP material was characterised using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cone calorimetry. The TGA results showed that the resin component of the GRP underwent pyrolysis over a temperature range of 225 °C to 450 °C when most of the resin mass was gasified leaving a solid char. The char material was completely consumed over a temperature range of 375 °C to 430 °C when heated in air. The DSC showed that, when heated in air, these two degradation steps released large amounts of energy. Cone calorimetry tests were conducted to measure the combustion behavior of the panel material (e. g. heat release rate (HRR) and time to ignition) when subjected to a constant incident radiant heat flux. The results showed that the panel material was flammable with a peak HRR of between 350 – 400 kW/m 2 and the minimum heat flux for ignition was determined to be 16. 5 kW/m...|$|R

At present potential onshore applications of FRP composites as main load bearing materials are being sought. This article outlines {{some of the recent}} research studies undertaken at the University of Manchester. Thermal performance of stringer wall system Previous studies 1, 2 have revealed surprisingly good performance of FRP composite construction under fire condi-tions. The stringer wall system (Fig 1) made by combining <b>GRP</b> studs, FRP <b>panels</b> or gypsum boards, and fire-rated core materials has been demonstrated to provide excellent thermal barrier and integrity under the standard Cellulosic or DoE hydrocarbon fire exposures. Fig 2 shows the temperature develop-ments of a stringer wall system made of phenolic laminate facing, mineral wool core and a 100 × 30 × 4 mm GRP C-channel. Finite element heat transfer models have been created to predict temperatures of the stringer wall panel using an in-house 2 -D heat transfer soft-ware. These numerical results (dotted lines) are compared to the measured temperatures (solid lines). As can be seen, temperatures for most of the GRP section remained below 100 °C, which is about the heat distortional temperature (HDT) of the composite, at 30 minutes of fire exposure. The mechanical compres-sion tests, discussed later, will show that the retention of strength is quite high below this level of elevated temperature, making this <b>GRP</b> stringer <b>panel</b> suitable as a load bearing construction material in low-rise buildings.

The focus will be on body parts that have specific relevance to transsexual experiences of gendered embodiment.

After all the genitals only represent about 1 % of body mass (Valentine and Wilkins 1997). However, within the sexological literature, genital reconstructive surgery is implicitly and explicitly emphasised as the most important factor in the construction of a happy and satisfied transsexual identity. A consequence of this concentration is that the transsexual is constantly equated with genital surgery, which has implications for authenticity in the clinician’s office, transgender studies and transgender politics. I chose to focus on modifications of body parts and not solely on genitals because these other characteristics have been overlooked in much of the sexological and transgender literature.
