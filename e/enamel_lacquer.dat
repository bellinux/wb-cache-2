50|$|Copper {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of transformer windings {{is in the form}} of wire for small products and strip for larger equipment. For small products, the wire must be strong enough to be wound without breakage, yet flexible enough to provide close-packed windings. Strip products must be of good surface quality so that insulating enamels do not break down under voltage. Good ductility is essential for the strip to be formed and packed while good strength is needed to withstand the high electro-mechanical stresses set up under occasional short-circuit conditions. Copper winding wires in transformers are compatible with all modern insulation materials, such as <b>lacquer</b> and <b>enamel.</b> <b>Lacquers</b> permit the close spacing of windings to give best efficiency in the coils.|$|R

40|$|The term {{organic coating}} {{encompasses}} conventional paints, varnishes, <b>enamels,</b> <b>lacquers,</b> water-emulsion and solution finishes, nonaqueous dispersions (organosols), plastisols and powder coatings. The following definitions {{have been used}} commonly, although they {{have not always been}} strictly applied. Paint is a suspension of finely divided pigment particles in a liquid composed of a binder (resin) and a volatile solvent, sometimes with additives to impart special characteristies. The volatile solvent evaporates from the diying fim after application, while the binder holds the pigment in the diy fim, causing it to adhere to the substrate. Some high quality, hard gloss paints are referred to as enamels (Piper, 1965; Schurr, 1981). Lacquer is defined as a coating that dries priariy by evaporation rather than by oxidation or polymerition. Because the solvents used in lacquers are relatively volatile and no chemical change is required for formation of the mm, lacquers diy veiy rapidly (Piper, 1965; Hamilton & Early, 1972). Vámish is defined as a homogeneous, transparent or translucent liquid that is converted to a solid, transparent fim after being applied as a thin layer (Schurr, 1981) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Virgin coconut oil, {{which can}} only be {{achieved}} by using fresh coconut meat or what is called non-copra, is widely produced in the Philippines. Paint, the group of emulsions generally consisting of pigments suspended in a liquid medium is used as decorative or protective coatings. Paint is usually formulated with a binder using linseed, soya, safflower oil or refined coconut oil. Virgin coconut oil has not yet been explored as a binder but its usage in the paint industry can contribute to the upliftment of the economic status of small scale-entrepreneurs. Virgin coconut oil, abundant in the Philippines, is investigated as potential binder in the production of white lacquer and clear gloss <b>lacquer</b> <b>enamel</b> paint. After a formulation was identified using virgin coconut oil, the paint was mixed and evaluated in terms of manufacturing control tests, evaluation tests and evaluation of acceptability by end users. The properties of white <b>lacquer</b> <b>enamel</b> paint mixed with virgin coconut oil in terms of density, 4. 57 kg / gal; flexibility; gloss, 79. 1 0; drying time, 12 hrs; and resistance to chemicals showed comparable results with paint mix with refined coconut oil. The properties of clear gloss <b>lacquer</b> <b>enamel</b> mixed with virgin coconut oil in terms of density 3. 62 kg / gal; gloss, 71. 5 0; flexibility and drying time in 6 sec. showed comparable results with paints prepared with refined coconut oil The evaluation of acceptability by end users from different industries showed favorable results. In conclusion, virgin coconut oil {{can be used as a}} potential binder in the production of <b>lacquer</b> <b>enamel</b> paint...|$|R

The values of yearly mean actual M.

50|$|In 1903, Eichengrün co-developed {{the first}} soluble form of {{cellulose}} acetate with Theodore Becker. He went on to develop processes for the manufacture {{of cellulose acetate}} materials and devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the technical and economic development of plastics, <b>lacquers,</b> <b>enamels,</b> and artificial fibers based on cellulose acetate. During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909. Cellulose acetate film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable nitrate film (better known as celluloid).|$|R
