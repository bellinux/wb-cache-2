[...] Although the identities of the perpetrators are unknown, Turpin may have been involved. [...] Two nights later they struck again, at the Woodford home of a gentleman named Richard Woolridge, a <b>Furnisher</b> of Small Arms in the Office of Ordnance at the Tower of London. [...] In December Jasper and Samuel Gregory, John Jones, and John Wheeler, attacked the home of John Gladwin (a higler) and John Shockley, in Chingford. [...] On 19December Turpin and five other men raided the home of Ambrose Skinner, a 73-year-old farmer from Barking, leaving with an estimated £300.|$|E
2500|$|Female milliners {{rose from}} the ranks of the mantuamakers and sat atop the {{hierarchy}} employing the mantuamakers, seamstresses, and other specialists. Milliners often offered more than one service. [...] A compilation of occupations listed in ads by women in business in England between 1760 and 1830 showed milliner combined with over a dozen other trades such as blackworker(embroiderer), draper, dressmaker, stationer, toy dealer, straw hat maker, haberdasher and <b>furnisher</b> of funerals. The cut and style of dresses throughout much of the eighteenth century did not change much making the trimmings of even more importance - many of which came directly from the milliner. [...] Clothing was the second biggest expense in the eighteenth century after food and as such was often remade or restyled. [...] From the style of dress, to trimmings, accessories, caps, and remaking of gowns the milliner was an important source of materials and advice on the latest style ...|$|E

60|$|The streets looked small, of course. The {{streets that}} we have only seen as {{children}} always do, I believe, when {{we go back to}} them. But I had forgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, until I came to Mr. Omer's shop.

60|$|I {{put my hand}} in his, {{wondering}} who he was, and we walked away to a shop in a narrow street, on which was written OMER, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL <b>FURNISHER,</b> &c. It was a close and stifling little shop; full {{of all sorts of}} clothing, made and unmade, including one window full of beaver-hats and bonnets. We went into a little back-parlour behind the shop, where we found three young women at work on a quantity of black materials, which were heaped upon the table, and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor. There was a good fire in the room, and a breathless smell of warm black crape--I did not know what the smell was then, but I know now.|$|E
60|$|But {{a further}} item of {{knowledge}} that my friend's inquiries had elicited had somewhat puzzled him. Hepworth's clerk, Ellenby, had been the confidential clerk of Hepworth's father! He had entered {{the service of the}} firm as a boy; and when Hepworth senior retired, Ellenby--with the old gentleman's assistance--had started in business for himself as a ships' <b>furnisher!</b> Nothing of all this came out at the trial. Ellenby had not been cross-examined. There was no need for it. But it seemed odd, under all the circumstances, that he had not volunteered the information. It may, of course, have been {{for the sake of the}} brother and sister. Hepworth is a common enough name in the North. He may have hoped to keep the family out of connection with the case.|$|E
60|$|There {{he seems}} to have hidden the hat and mackintosh and to have taken in {{exchange}} some clothes belonging to the murdered man. Hepworth's clerk, Ellenby, an elderly man--of the type that one generally describes as of gentlemanly appearance--was accustomed to his master being away unexpectedly on business, which was that of a ships' <b>furnisher.</b> He always kept an overcoat and a bag ready packed in the office. Missing them, Ellenby had assumed that his master had been called away by an early train. He would have been worried after a few days, but that he had received a telegram--as he then supposed from his master--explaining that young Hepworth had gone to Ireland and would be away for some days. It was nothing unusual for Hepworth to be absent, superintending the furnishing of a ship, for a fortnight at a time, and nothing had transpired in the office necessitating special instructions. The telegram had been handed in at Charing Cross, but the time chosen had been a busy period of the day, and no one had any recollection of the sender. Hepworth's clerk unhesitatingly identified the body as that of his employer, for whom it was evident that he had entertained a feeling of affection. About Mrs. Hepworth he said as little as he could. While she was awaiting her trial it had been necessary for him to see her once or twice with reference to the business. Previous to this, he knew nothing about her.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., {{consumer}} reporting agencies {{collect and}} aggregate personal information, financial data, and alternative data on individuals {{from a variety}} of sources called data <b>furnishers</b> with which the reporting agencies have a relationship. Data <b>furnishers</b> are typically creditors, lenders, utilities, debt collection agencies (credit bureaus) and the courts (i.e. public records) that a consumer has had a relationship or experience with. Data <b>furnishers</b> report their payment experience with the consumer to the credit reporting agencies. The data provided by the <b>furnishers</b> as well as collected by the bureaus are then aggregated into the consumer reporting agency's data repository or files. The resulting information is made available on request to customers of the consumer reporting agencies' for the purposes of credit risk assessment, credit scoring or for other purposes such as employment consideration or leasing an apartment. Given the large number of consumer borrowers, these credit scores tend to be mechanistic. To simplify the analytical process for their customers, the different consumer reporting agencies can apply a mathematical algorithm to provide a score the customer can use to more rapidly assess the likelihood that an individual will repay a particular debt given the frequency that other individuals in similar situations have defaulted. Most consumer welfare advocates advise individuals to review their credit reports at least once a year to ensure they are accurate.|$|R
6000|$|You {{said that}} if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it, and you said truly. I {{do not know how}} I got along without her, before. I was a forlorn old tree, but now that this blossoming vine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life, it is very different. As a <b>furnisher</b> of {{business}} for me and for Mammy Dorcas she is exhaustlessly competent, but I like my share of it and of course Dorcas likes hers, for Dorcas [...] "raised" [...] George, and Cathy is George over again in so many ways that she brings back Dorcas's youth and the joys of that long-vanished time. My father tried to set Dorcas free twenty years ago, when we still lived in Virginia, but without success; she considered herself {{a member of the family}}, and wouldn't go. And so, a member of the family she remained, and has held that position unchallenged ever since, and holds it now; for when my mother sent her here from San Bernardino when we learned that Cathy was coming, she only changed from one division of the family to the other. She has the warm heart of her race, and its lavish affections, and when Cathy arrived the pair were mother and child in five minutes, and that is what they are to date and will continue. Dorcas really thinks she raised George, and that is one of her prides, but perhaps it was a mutual raising, for their ages were the same--thirteen years short of mine. But they were playmates, at any rate; as regards that, there is no room for dispute.|$|E
