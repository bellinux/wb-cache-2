He felt that, {{because he could not}} throw fast, honing a knuckleball offered him his best shot at success. He used a tennis ball to practice.|$|E

Tolstov reveals {{that they are not}} mining for uranium, but that they are <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters (HQ), and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes a hard drive containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E

5|$|In England cannon {{were being}} used to besiege various {{fortified}} buildings during the English Civil War. Nathaniel Nye is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643 and <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> saker in 1645. From 1645 he was the master gunner to the Parliamentarian garrison at Evesham and in 1646 he successfully directed the artillery at the Siege of Worcester, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book The Art of Gunnery. Believing that war {{was as much a}} science as an art, his explanations focused on triangulation, arithmetic, theoretical mathematics, and cartography as well as practical considerations such as the ideal specification for gunpowder or slow matches. His book acknowledged mathematicians such as Robert Recorde and Marcus Jordanus as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Thomas (or Francis) Malthus (author of A Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works).|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo was {{the first}} to discern {{magnetic}} declination of true north while <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> compass. Shen theorized that geographical climates gradually shifted over time. He created a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern geomorphology. He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham {{was the first}} to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
