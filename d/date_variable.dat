40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} a 2 factors-model for pricing defaultable bond with discrete default intensity and barrier where the 2 factors are stochastic risk free short rate process and firm value process. We {{assume that the}} default event occurs in an expected manner when the firm value reaches a given default barrier at predetermined discrete announcing dates or in an unexpected manner at the first jump time of a Poisson process with given default intensity given by a step function of time variable. Then our pricing model is given by a solving problem of several linear PDEs with variable coefficients and terminal value of binary type in every subinterval between the two adjacent announcing dates. Our main approach is to use higher order binaries. We first provide the pricing formulae of higher order binaries with time dependent coefficients and consider their integrals on the last expiry <b>date</b> <b>variable.</b> Then using the pricing formulae of higher binary options and their integrals, we give the pricing formulae of defaultable bonds in both cases of exogenous and endogenous default recoveries and credit spread analysis.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a suite of photogrammetric methods for reconstructing insect wing kinematics, to provide {{instantaneous}} topographic maps of the wing surface. We filmed tethered locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) and free-flying hoverflies (Eristalis tenax) using four high-speed digital video cameras. We digitized multiple natural features and marked points on the wings using manual and automated tracking. Epipolar geometry was used to identify additional points on the hoverfly wing outline which were anatomically indistinguishable. The cameras were calibrated using a bundle adjustment technique that provides {{an estimate of the}} error associated with each individual data point. The mean absolute three-dimensional measurement error was 0. 11  mm for the locust and 0. 03  mm for the hoverfly. The error in the angle of incidence was at worst 0. 51 ° (s. d.) for the locust and 0. 88 ° (s. d.) for the hoverfly. The results {{we present a}}re of unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution, and represent the most detailed measurements of insect wing kinematics to <b>date.</b> <b>Variable</b> spanwise twist and camber are prominent in the wingbeats of both the species, and are of such complexity {{that they would not be}} adequately captured by lower resolution techniques.

Methods: Pharmacy-billed disease-modifying drug prescription claims were selected from the 2007 – 2008 LifeLink™ Health Plan Claims Database. The index date was the first disease-modifying drug prescription claim. Two cohorts were created: all patients with a disease-modifying drug claim in 2007 and a subset with continuous eligibility for 12 months post-index. Adherence was calculated across all disease-modifying drugs for 12 months post-index. Medication possession ratios (MPRs) with variable (start to end of therapy) and fixed (365 days) duration denominators were calculated. Variable MPR was calculated by summing days supply from the first to the last prescription (inclusive) divided by time between the last prescription date plus days supply and the first prescription <b>date.</b> <b>Variable</b> MPR was evaluated for all patients and the continuously eligible cohort. Fixed MPR used the same numerator but divided by 365 days of follow-up and evaluated only for the continuously eligible cohort. Results: There were 3405 patients with MS and a disease-modifying drug claim in 2007 and 2145 in the continuously eligible cohort. Means for variable MPR ranged from 87. 5 % ± 16. 6 % for the continuously eligible cohort to 90. 5 % ± 16. 0 % for the 2007 cohort. The comparable value for fixed MPR was 78. 0 % ± 28. 2 % for the continuously eligible cohort. Fixed MPR gave a consistently lower rate of adherence than variable MPR at an 80 % adherence threshold. Conclusion: Different adherence measures can yield different outcomes, especially when using different eligibility criteria. These results demonstrate the importance of full disclosure of methods used for calculations and specification of the study population.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an insight into}} a doctoral thesis at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Objective of this work was to analyse the reasons for success of know-how-intensive and technology-oriented Start-ups (KITSs) and to assess the potential for success at an early point {{of time in the}} companies’ life cycle development. By demonstrating factors for success and failure and using them for the categorisation of start-ups, information asymmetries should be reduced and the success rate of these companies increased. First, an explanatory model of the success of KITSs was developed, describing success factors as a cause for subsequent company success (effect). Success factors, relevance systems and interactions were identified in expert interviews, providing empirical cause-effect relationships based on experience. Second, a descriptive decision model (rating model) was derived which enables the categorisation (“Stars”, “High potential for success”, “Low potential for success”) of a single case (specific KITS) through the application of the “general rules” identified in the success factors analysis. Success factors research (strategic management theory), rating theory (and practice) as well as model theory (heuristics) provide the theoretical framework for this work. A qualitative research design allowed the generation of {{a deeper understanding of the}} complex problem area. Furthermore, the lack of studies focusing on KITSs providing an up to <b>date</b> <b>variable</b> pool lead to a qualitative-explorative approach. 36 problem-centered interviews were conducted with founders of young, established but also failed know-how-intensive and technology-oriented companies from different industry fields and experts of technology-intensive markets and companies (venture capitalists, business angels, representatives of funding agencies and incubators, start-up coaches, serial entrepreneurs). Factors for success and failure were identified in the domains of “team”, “finance” and “market-technology-fit”. For the rating model, the success factors are viewed as the “rating criteria”, factors for failure as “warning signals”. The weight of each rating criteria relates to the respective relevance identified in the success factors model and varies in dependence of the distinguishing features applicable to the specific KITS. For the evaluation of the KITS, the classification heuristics for evaluation and selection of alternatives “tallying” and “take-the-best” were identified. As one further result of the interviews, a “rating heuristic” was developed for the evaluation (rating) of a specific KITS...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} city forecasts of UK data releases as collected by Standard and Poor's MMS. It finds that the median forecast calculated by MMS are, {{for the majority of}} series, biased and inefficient. The numerical size of these deviations is found to be small, unlike in some other studies. Evidence is presented that revisions may take place during the period between the collection of the forecast and the publication of the data. If significant forecast revisions take place this would compromise the usefulness of forecast surveys in the estimation of 'news' effects on financial asset prices. Regression analysis does not suggest that revisions can be systematically measured by changes in current <b>dated</b> <b>variables</b> or by news from other variables. News effects therefore measure the direct effect of the forecast error rather than also including the effects of revisions to forecasts of, as yet, unpublished data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

In {{the last couple}} of decades, obesity rates have increased steadily. Understanding and increasing physical activity is a key to tackling this issue, especially for college students. Additionally, these young adults are entering into more intimate and committed relationships. The connection between exercise and dating relationships is unknown, as studies of social influences on exercise have neglected this central relationship in college students’ lives. Another feature to understanding both exercise and dating relationship patterns are mood and trait associations. A review of the existing research connects these four variables and offers possible models for their mechanisms. Methods. Analyses included data for mood and traits from the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), respectively. Novel measures of the exercise and relationship variables were developed from the Motivational Structure Questionnaire (MSQ). The relationship <b>variables</b> included <b>dating</b> goals, relationship satisfaction, and dating relationship status. Results. All analyses performed for total group and separately for each sex, and many sex differences were found. Analyses replicated previous associations found between mood and both physical activity and <b>dating</b> relationship <b>variables.</b> For novel findings, various types of analyses (correlations, ANOVAs, chi-square, and multiple regression) indicated associations between the exercise and <b>dating</b> relationship <b>variables.</b> Analyses also included mediation of negative affect between exercise and relationship satisfaction. Lastly, the investigation explored associations between alternative physical activity measures as well as desired body change, including weight loss, with the mood, exercise, and <b>dating</b> relationship <b>variables.</b> Conclusions. <b>Dating</b> relationship patterns were associated with exercise variables, and negative affect may mediate this association for relationship satisfaction.

The great diversification and the special features that characterize yogurt production lines (satisfaction of multiple due <b>dates,</b> <b>variable</b> processing times, sequence-dependent setup times and costs and monitoring of inventory levels), render generic scheduling methodologies impractical for real-world applications.

The problem of non-additivity is demonstrated with the architecture of the RWI-business cycle models how they were constructed by 2005. One of the theses of this study is that the unchained volumes measured by constant prices of the previous year (which can be ordered at Germany’s Office for National Statistics) are solving the problem (i) not only partly (Nierhaus 2004), but totally when embedded in the environment of an econometric model in an appropriate way.
