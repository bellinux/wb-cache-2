2500|$|Richard Arkwright first {{spinning}} mill, Cromford Mill, Derbyshire, {{was built}} in 1771. It contained his invention the water frame. The water frame was developed from the spinning frame that Arkwright had developed with (a different) John Kay, from Warrington. [...] The original design was again claimed by Thomas Highs: which he purposed he had patented in 1769. [...] Arkwright used waterwheels to power the textile machinery. His initial attempts at <b>driving</b> the <b>frame</b> had used horse power, but a mill needed far more power. Using a waterwheel demanded a location with a ready supply of water, hence the mill at Cromford.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to analyse factors {{affecting}} worries, coping strategies and decisions of young drivers regarding the risk of sleep-related car crashes. Furthermore, the study also analyses whether framing the same information about sleepiness in two different linguistic forms influences: (1) the evaluation of the level of risk associated to a specific level of drowsiness (Attribute Framing problem); (2) the willingness to enact strategies to "prevent" sleepiness before night-time <b>driving</b> (Goal <b>Framing</b> problem); (3) the choice between two different ways, both of equal expected efficacy, of lowering drowsiness (Risky decision-making Framing problem). Six hundred and ninety-five young drivers [(57. 6 % females, 42. 4 % males); mean age 20. 85 years (S. D. = 1. 2) ] answered questions on drive risk perception and sleepiness, on nocturnal driving experience and on the strategies to deal with driver sleepiness, responding to one of the two different versions of the framed problems. A sub-sample of 130 participants completed the framed problems in both versions. The results show that experiences of sleep attacks and nocturnal driving frequency in the past 6 months affect both risk perception and the preventive strategies adopted.

40|$|The TV oak (Television Oak) {{conflict}} concerned felling an old tree in {{a wealthy}} area of Stockholm. The case received great public attention in different media formats with different scopes (e. g., newspapers, television, internet). The TV Oak issue involved actors with different, partly conflicting perceptions. Assuming that the relevance of urban tree management issues in particular leads to increased interest among the local audience, this paper compared differences in reporting on the TV Oak case in local and national newspapers. The comparison comprised the actors “speaking” in the newspapers, the interest roles attributed to different actors and the frames used. The empirical materials used were articles concerning the TV Oak published between October 2011 and June 2012 in one local and two national Swedish newspapers. Quantitative analysis of statements in these articles showed that the geographical scope of the newspaper was not the major <b>driving</b> force <b>framing</b> the TV Oak conflict and that variety of framings, ranging from a humanised perception of the oak to a more analytical hazard perception, were used. Differences between the interest roles allocated to different actors (e. g., in terms of victim, causer, and helper in the oak conflict) showed that the framing of conflicts very much depended on single actors, in particular a high profile journalist in the national newspapers and private individuals writing {{letters to the editor}} in the local newspaper...|$|R

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory has {{developed}} a real-time video transmission system for low bandwidth remote operations. The system supports both continuous transmission of video for remote driving and progressive transmission of still images. Inherent in the system design is a spatiotemporal limitation {{to the effects of}} channel errors. The average data rate of the system is 64, 000 bits/s, a compression of approximately 1000 : 1 for the black and white National Television Standard Code video. The image quality of the transmissions is maintained at a level that supports teleoperation of a high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle at speeds up to 15 mph on a moguled dirt track. Video compression is achieved by using Laplacian image pyramids and a combination of classical techniques. Certain subbands of the image pyramid are transmitted by using interframe differencing with a periodic refresh to aid in bandwidth reduction. Images are also foveated to concentrate image detail in a steerable region. The system supports dynamic video quality adjustments between frame rate, image detail, and foveation rate. A typical configuration for the system used during <b>driving</b> has a <b>frame</b> rate of 4 Hz, a compression per frame of 125 : 1, and a resulting latency of less than 1 s...|$|R
40|$|In the {{sinusoidal}} phase modulating interferometer technique, {{the high-speed}} CCD {{is necessary to}} detect the interference signals. The reason of ordinary CCD's low frame rate was analyzed, and a novel high-speed image sensing technique with adjustable frame rate based on ail ordinary CCD was proposed. And {{the principle of the}} image sensor was analyzed. When the maximum frequency and channel bandwidth were constant, a custom high-speed sensor was designed by using the ordinary CCD {{under the control of the}} special <b>driving</b> circuit. The <b>frame</b> rate of the ordinary CCD has been enhanced by controlling the number of pixels of every frame; therefore, the ordinary of CCD can be used as the high frame rate image sensor with small amount of pixels. The multi-output high-speed image sensor has the deficiencies of low accuracy, and high cost, while the high-speed image senor with small number of pixels by using this technique can overcome theses faults. The light intensity varying with time was measured by using the image sensor. The frame rate was LIP to 1600 frame per second (f/s), and the size of every frame and the frame rate were adjustable. The correlation coefficient between the measurement result and the standard values were higher than 0. 98026, and the relative error was lower than 0. 53 %. The experimental results show that this sensor is fit to the measurements of sinusoidal phase modulating interferometer technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

40|$|Providing {{high quality}} {{education}} for student learning {{is dependent upon}} the professional learning quality afforded to teachers. Teacher learning must remain of paramount importance in education because as “staff members learn and improve their instructional practice, students benefit and show increases in learning (Richardson, 1997, 1998) ” (York-Barr, 2001). When professional learning designs a strong relationship between teaching practice and student learning, then teachers bridge curriculum initiatives and reform agenda efforts into the realities of their classrooms through the interactions of their learning experiences and student engagement. ^ Professional learning {{runs the risk of}} falling victim to traditional methods that are disconnected, fragmented, and incoherent (Fullan, 1991). The particular interest of this study is the disconnected professional practices that are foreign to teaching practice. Examining the process of teacher learning will reveal the ways in which teachers are making connections between their learning and classroom practice. ^ To narrow the scope of this broad professional learning range, this study investigates two third grade teachers professional learning experience by using collaborative action research in the context of mathematics assessment to promote students 2 ̆ 7 mathematics learning. For this qualitative study, I seek answers to the following questions: What happens when teachers participate in collaborative inquire to inform their assessment practices in mathematics? How do teachers construct mathematics assessments through collaborative inquiry? What are the influential factors that shape their decision making around mathematics assessment construction? What do we learn about this teacher learning process by examining teacher artifacts, interactions and reflections? ^ Methods of this study include analyzing the collected artifacts from the teachers 2 ̆ 7 collaborative inquiry activities. Artifacts were analyzed by coding methods, themes and patterns, knowledge and performance frameworks (NCTM, 2000), the district 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics curriculum and Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Taxonomy (OfficePort, 2005).

Politicising Europe presents the most comprehensive contribution to empirical research on politicisation to date. The study is innovative in both conceptual and empirical terms. Conceptually, the contributors develop and apply a new index and typology of politicisation. Empirically, the volume presents {{a huge amount of}} original data, tracing politicisation in a comparative perspective over more than forty years. Focusing on six European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK) from the 1970 s to the current euro crisis, the book examines conflicts over Europe in election campaigns, street protests, and public debates on every major step in the integration process. It shows that European integration has indeed become politicised. However, the patterns and developments differ markedly across countries and arenas, and many of the key hypotheses on the driving forces of change need to be revisited in view of new findings.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} has emerged a new {{environmental}} issue affecting developing countries particularly after {{the signing of}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in June 1992. This dissertation focuses on the factors which motivate Indian responses to global climate change at the international level. ^ The study evaluates the relative impacts of two policy frames in the formulation of India 2 ̆ 7 s national climate change policy stance. The concept of 2 ̆ 2 policy frames 2 ̆ 2 refers to the idea that the definition of, and responses to a particular problem are constructed in terms of another more pressing and salient policy concern. A 2 ̆ 2 policy frame 2 ̆ 2 is an analytically constructed policy filter comprised of key, identifiable, policy features and existing resource constraints in a sector. The study traces the evolution of national energy (coal power and renewable energy) and environment sector policies under centralized planning based on a survey of a series of Five Year Plans (1970 - 1997). Characteristic sectoral policies are identified as constituting an 2 ̆ 2 energy-related development policy frame 2 ̆ 2 and an 2 ̆ 2 environment-related development policy frame 2 ̆ 2 under two distinct phases of national economic development [...] a managed economy and a liberalized economy. ^ The study demonstrates that the 1991 shift towards phased economic liberalization resulted not only in a new set of energy (coal, power and renewable energy) policies and consequently an altered energy policy frame, but also in a largely unchanged set of environmental sector policies and consequently only a marginally altered environmental policy frame. The study demonstrates that the post- 1991 energy policy changes together with existing energy resource constraints, constitute the dominant policy <b>frame</b> <b>driving</b> both the formulation of Indian policy stances at international climate change negotiations and also Indian responsiveness to coal, power, renewable energy, and climate change projects funded by the World Bank and GEF. ^ The study also demonstrates that key features of the energy policy frame functions as a shared cognitive reference for a select group of national policy actors (comprising both policy makers and policy experts), responsible for formulating climate change policy responses. The study highlights the influential role played by very small set of national policy experts who construct national climate change options on the basis of features of the energy policy frame. ...|$|R
