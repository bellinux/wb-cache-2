Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} {{restoration}} of religious education {{in public schools}} {{began in the late}} 1940s. The government initially responded by authorizing religious instruction in state schools <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> whose parents requested it. Under Democrat Party rule during the 1950s, religious education was made compulsory in secondary schools unless parents made a specific request to have their children excused. Religious education was made compulsory for all primary and secondary school children in 1982.|$|E

In recent years, more students have opted to complete their degrees on the Fort Wayne campus.|$|E
25|$|Postwar {{population}} growth {{led to the}} expansion of two buildings in the late 1950s. The first was the Presbyterian Church, which received a new Sunday School wing in 1955. Two years later the high school across the street followed. It had been in excess of its original design capacity since 1937. The new wing, completed in 1957, was used at first for the junior high school students (since then a separate building has been constructed <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> and the entire building is used by the high school). It was built of brick and intended to be architecturally sympathetic.|$|E
25|$|As World War II {{approached}} {{its conclusion}} (effectively on 14 August but formally not until 2 September), training {{activities and the}} strength of Training Command declined. The end of the war in Europe in May caused the focus of training to shift from the needs of the European Theater to those of the Pacific, particularly courses associated with very heavy bombardment. Then, with the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, most training ceased <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> not planning to remain in the post-war air forces. Before that time, however, the trend in training had gone increasingly toward specialized training on particular types of aircraft. Then during the last four months of 1945, rapid retrenchment in training occurred, and emphasis shifted to separating people from the Army Air Forces and reorganizing Training Command for its still undetermined peacetime goals.|$|E

[...] After a major fundraising effort led by Baker, Zen Center purchased the land—which contained a rundown resort and mineral springs in 1967.

His appointment to the former was not universally popular. His later successor as director, Stephen Shennan, would comment that Ucko went about his job [...] "with characteristic forcefulness, making new appointments, overturning existing structures and overhauling the syllabus at all levels." [...] Ucko immediately implemented changes to the manner in which undergraduate courses were taught, based on his experiences at Southampton. Bringing in compulsory core courses for second and third years on such subjects as archaeological theory and public archaeology, he focused on generalisation at the undergraduate level, reserving specialisation <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> who went on to study at a master's degree level, expanding the number of master's degrees on offer.|$|E

2500|$|However, a {{large number}} of technologically complex devices do exist, and most of these devices exist in the Muggle world. From a certain perspective, {{it can be seen that}} Magic and {{electricity}} are the equivalents of each other in their respective worlds, but electronic equipment doesn't work around magic-filled areas, such as Hogwarts, and Muggle devices used by wizards (such as cameras and radios) can be made to function using magic instead of electricity. Such examples are rare, however; wizards rarely make use of Muggle technology, nor do they have much interest in doing so, even when such technology might make their lives much easier. Pure-blood Wizards are baffled by how Muggle technology works and most have no interest in understanding it (with occasional exceptions, such as Muggle aficionado Arthur Weasley, whose dearest dream is [...] "to find out how an aeroplane stays up"). [...] "Muggle Studies" [...] classes are offered at Hogwarts <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> with an interest.

2500|$|To begin with, Latin and Greek were in trouble: ancient {{languages}} did {{not seem}} to have much application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually being introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or Hebrew. It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its manifest destiny to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called [...] "parallel course of study" [...] in scientific and [...] "literary" [...] subjects. [...] The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>students</b> wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study. [...] An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by Hobart College in Geneva, New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the [...] "practical business of life…without passing through a tedious course of classical studies." [...] But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President Jasper Adams and partly for lack of funds. [...] A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.|$|E
