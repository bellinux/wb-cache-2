40|$|Abstract <b>User</b> <b>experience</b> {{has become}} a popular term in {{research}} and industry. There {{has been a great}} attempt to study and design <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> This thesis gives a practical view to <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> studies and methods by reporting test settings and results of the ADAMOS case studies. The goal of the ADAMOS project was to investigate context- and action-sensitive services in terms of how <b>users</b> <b>experience</b> when the system can detect one’s location and actions, and then adjust according to this information. The aim of this thesis is to investigate problems and issues in studying <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> of mobile services and to find out in which conditions the study of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is possible and meaningful. As a contribution this thesis provides practical information for conducting <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> studies and evaluating experiences. The first contribution is a framework (U 2 E-Frame), which I created and improved iteratively in each test case. The framework is method-independent and it can be used for planning and conducting tests. The second contribution of the thesis is the practical view to all methods that are created, applied, presented and evaluated in this thesis. Especially during this thesis work three novel methods (Mobile Feedback, 3 E-Diary and SUE methodology) have been developed and evaluated. The evaluation of the research methods illustrates that the best practice to study <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is to use several methods together. This enables deeper understanding of <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> As the third contribution of this thesis I introduce a proposal of ten <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> heuristics for design and evaluation of <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> The aim of these heuristics is to enable designers to understand what meaning <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> has in product design. Developers can use these heuristics for designing and evaluating <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> aspects in product design. This thesis presents the main challenges in <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> research: know what to study (comprehensive <b>user</b> <b>experience),</b> know how to study it (find appropriate methods) and know how to evaluate and design it (<b>user</b> <b>experience</b> heuristics). An answer to the research problem is that it is both possible and meaningful to study <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> when we know <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> targets, and features of the services we want to investigate, and we can use the most appropriate methods, ensure the participant’s commitment to the test and ensure analysing relationships between results collected with different methods...|$|R

However, usability and <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> differ from one another with many aspects. While the heuristic evaluation is procedurally similar when evaluating usability or <b>user</b> <b>experience,</b> the fundamental {{differences between the two}} challenge the applicability of the method itself. The aim of this thesis is to take a critical look at usability and <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> evaluation using general usability heuristics created by Nielsen and Molich in 1990 and <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> heuristics created by Arhippainen in 2009.
