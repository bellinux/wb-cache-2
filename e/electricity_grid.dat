Gaalkacyo, a desert town in central Somalia, was provided with streetlights by local entrepreneur Abdirizak Osman, who expanded his enterprises from telecommunications to power generators, not only lighting the town but also supplying free electricity to the local hospital.|$|E

5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid.</b> This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid.</b> They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid.</b> Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best {{available}} in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid,</b> water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E

50|$|Large scale {{sustainable}} SNG {{will enable}} the UK gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>grids</b> to be substantially de-carbonised in parallel at source, while maintaining the existing operational and economic relationship between the gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>grids.</b> Carbon capture and sequestration can be added at little additional cost, thereby progressively achieving deeper de-carbonisation of the existing gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>grids</b> at low cost and operational risk. Cost benefit studies indicate that large scale 50% biogenic carbon content sustainable SNG can be injected into the high pressure gas transmission grid {{at a cost of}} around 65p/therm. At this cost, it is possible to re-process fossil natural gas, used as an energy input into the gasification process, into 5 to 10 times greater quantity of sustainable SNG. Large scale sustainable SNG, combined with continuing natural gas production from UK continental shelf and unconventional gas, will potentially enable the cost of UK peak electricity to be de-coupled from international oil denominated 'take or pay' gas supply contracts.|$|R
