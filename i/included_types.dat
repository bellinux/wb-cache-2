Parts of the company under core business structuring moved from its ownership to focus the main concept of the company.|$|E

Kara became one with the natural environment around her. By 1961 Kara had collected over 160 specimens which <b>included</b> <b>types</b> of toadstool and fungi. Significantly, two new types of fungi were named after her - Poria healeyi and Lambertella healeyi. Poria healeyi, which was a previously unidentified fungus causing yellow straw rot in Mountain Ash, and the second, Lambertella healeyi was a fungus growing on another fungus. Further, Kara collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found and forwarded those as well. In total over 500 specimens were collected which also included 80 species of moss. Subsequently Tarra Valley is the most thoroughly studied and recorded area in Australia at the time.|$|E
