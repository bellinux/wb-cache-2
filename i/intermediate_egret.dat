40|$|Factors {{commonly}} {{thought to}} influence the breeding success of colonial egrets were measured over 4 years. No significant difference in breeding success occurred between years, and {{the position of the}} natal tree in the colony did not affect breeding success. Evidence of synchronous breeding was found, but only <b>intermediate</b> <b>Egrets</b> had a higher fledging success for nests that fledged young during the peak nesting month. The amount of rainfall in the five months prior to the onset of nesting was positively correlated with the fledging success of <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Egrets,</b> suggesting the importance of food availability for this species. Nesting success found in New South Wales was compared to that reported elsewhere, and found to be less than that calculated to maintain stable populations.

50|$|The {{great egret}} {{is a large}} heron with all-white plumage. Standing up to 1 m tall, this species can measure 80 to 104 cm in length and have a {{wingspan}} of 131 to 170 cm.

In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults.
