25|$|Hostess: Marry, my lord, {{there is}} a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve had a {{telegram}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> sacking me," [...] {{he said to}} the girl, as she returned soon after, laden with small parcels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sandringham. Where we live. I got {{the name}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> I {{remember}} him telling {{me there was}} a place called that in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Once away <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> castle,' said he, 'troubles {{will fall}} upon you {{thick enough to}} satisfy even your longings.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Duncan, if I {{decline to}} do so. You, aided by Pultzer and others, stole them <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> library, and then threw {{suspicion}} on me." ...|$|R
50|$|These are {{lines from}} Goethe’s Faust I.i, “That which you inherit <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>fathers</b> / You must earn {{in order to}} possess.”—Goethe’s Faust, trans. Randall Jarrell, p. 35 (1976).|$|R
6000|$|... "So soon! Well, I {{must not}} detain you, Marmaduke. I heard <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> this morning. He is {{very anxious to}} see you settled in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Suavely.) Allow me {{to point}} out, my dear Mrs. Chalmers, {{that you are}} not merely {{stealing}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> You are playing the traitor to your class.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} is up now," [...] Nigel Forbes said to Harry. [...] "You {{have not heard}} anything, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> of our being wanted, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish we {{had never}} met them!" [...] cried Mrs. Lapham. [...] "I {{wish we had}} never thought of building! I wish he had kept away <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> business!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{he was a}} Bible king, and {{one never}} thinks of them. Italy! well, this I did not expect <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> daughter! <b>Your</b> great-great- {{great-grandfather}} {{must have been an}} Englishman born, Mr, Effingham?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, and can it be? I {{should like}} to inquire how his son, my truant protege', is going on. And <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> {{description}} of the vault, the interior must be interesting. Suppose we go in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{that bears}} {{somewhat}} on my mission. I have {{to deliver a}} message <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> the king. He bids me {{say that you are}} to return home immediately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no intimation yet <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> or mother that you were coming back to school again," [...] he began. [...] "But I suppose THEY have decided upon your return?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN [taken {{aback by}} his assurance] Well, {{you have got}} a nice healthy two inches of cheek all over you. I don't know where you got it. Not <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> anyhow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure {{nothing but}} a {{conscientious}} feeling would have separated you <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> friends," [...] said the old Liberal. And then they were parted, and the member for Silverbridge was bustled {{up to the table}} between two staunch Tories.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{are quite}} a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on whether your {{relations}} notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> kinsfolk, the Eyres?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'MY DARLING DAUGHTER,--I am much {{surprised}} at receiving no answer [...] to my long letter. All is forgiven. I should {{so much like}} to see [...] you again before I die, and to have you married <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> [...] house. All is forgiven.--Your loving mother, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, {{you must}} {{try to find out}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> all that he knows about Marizano and his movements. That is the first step. After that I will {{consider}} what can be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|McCOMAS (sternly). Very serious news <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> Miss Clandon. Very serious news indeed. (He {{crosses to}} the ottoman, and sits down. Dolly, looking deeply impressed, follows him and sits beside him on his right.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{the bearer}} of {{important}} news," [...] he announced. [...] "Dispatches from the front. You’ll hear all about it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> when he comes home, but I {{wanted to be the}} first with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is not the}} way to win a lady's heart, Mordaunt," [...] cried Kate, gayly. [...] "It is {{only fifteen}} miles <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> door to the Hickories, you ought to know, sir; and you have a {{standing}} invitation to darken its door with your military form." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The same. She had fled, you may remember, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> {{court for}} fear of being {{compelled}} to wed with Gunrig, the chief whose crown you cracked so deftly on the day of your arrival. She, poor thing, took refuge at first with me. I hid her for some time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} {{the heart to}} do it,' {{answered}} the servant. 'I would rather think of some way of saving your life, {{and at the same}} time of protecting ourselves <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> anger. By good luck the dog has followed us. We will kill it, and cut out the heart and take it back to <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> He will believe it is yours, and you, in the meantime, will have made your escape.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't have minded {{the beating}} so much. Among our people, parents {{have the right}} to be severe, and it is better to take a beating <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> than to be punished by the rabbi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{we go on}} {{to the end of the}} week," [...] he said; [...] "and {{still no}} letter <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> comes, for you, or for me? Will you admit, then, that his silence is suspicious?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want--I want--Never {{mind what}} I want. It is <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> that I shall demand it, not from you. I shall {{take care to}} see myself righted. I know the French law {{as well as the}} Swiss.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the gentleman}} {{spoke in a}} very low voice. 'A cheque has been changed which you took <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> house. No doubt <b>your</b> <b>father</b> will pardon that when you are once with him. But in order that we may bring you back safely we can arrest you on the score of the cheque,-- if you force us to do so. We {{certainly}} shall not let you go on board. If you will travel back to London with me, you shall be subjected to no inconvenience which can be avoided.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And he's {{not coming}} {{only for a}} visit; he's coming to stay here; <b>from</b> what <b>your</b> <b>father</b> says, I suppose he'll stay here {{the greater part of}} the summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{you done}} more than that," [...] said Injun Joe, {{approaching}} the doctor, who was now standing. [...] "Five years ago you drove me away <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've GOT you, {{and you got to}} SETTLE, you know!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, see here, Pen," [...] she said, as {{she closed}} it behind her, [...] "I've had {{just as much}} as I can stand <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> and if you don't tell me this instant what it all means----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then on {{your own}} head be it, and farewell. Oh! I would add {{that there is a}} certain {{property}} in cattle, and the fruit of lands which descends to you <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> In the event of your death----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got {{a sort of}} {{easy way}} of droppin' in whar you ain't invited, Brant," [...] {{he said with a}} grim smile, which was not, however, without a certain air of approval. [...] "Got it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father mine, {{greatest}} of men!" [...] She {{raised her head}} and laughed into his eyes, the while brushing back the thick iron-gray hair which thatched the dome of his forehead. [...] "You, who have wrestled more mightily, done greater things than these painters and versifiers. You who know so well the law of change. Might not the same plaint fall <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> lips were he to sit now beside you and look upon your work and you?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I wouldn't have {{accepted}} a penny <b>from</b> her. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> was different. He told you, in my presence, {{when we were}} in Paris, that it was your duty to marry me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Louisa, more grimly than ever, [...] "all I ask {{of you is}} to {{come home}} and be married <b>from</b> under <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> roof. Do have that much respect for your parents' memory, at least." ...|$|R
