40|$|On {{the fiftieth}} {{anniversary of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964, this Article asks how federal civil rights laws evolved to {{incorporate}} the needs of non-English speakers following landmark immigration reform (the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act) that led to unprecedented migration from Asia and Latin America. Based on a comparative study {{of the emergence of}} language rights in schools and workplaces from 1965 to 1980, the Article demonstrates that regulatory agencies used nonbinding <b>guidances</b> <b>to</b> interpret the undefined statutory term 2 ̆ 2 national origin discrimination 2 ̆ 2 during their implementation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Their efforts facilitated the creation of language rights, albeit to different extents in schools and workplaces.

The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate <b>guidance</b> <b>to</b> the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures.

5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide <b>guidance</b> <b>to</b> those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
