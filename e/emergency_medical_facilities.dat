50|$|Offshore diving {{generally}} {{takes place}} at remote sites, and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> may be far away, so {{it is common to}} include relatively complex and expensive emergency facilities and personnel on site.

Offshore diving operations are expensive and inherently hazardous, so extensive planning and effective management are necessary to control risk and ensure that the necessary work is done effectively.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, {{homeless}} shelters ban alcohol. In 1997, {{as the result}} of an inquest into the deaths of two homeless alcoholics two years earlier, Toronto's Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a [...] "wet shelter" [...] on a [...] "managed alcohol" [...] principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>facilities.</b> The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities, and a study of Ottawa's [...] "wet shelter" [...] found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half. The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006, found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to emergency rooms dropped from 13.5 to an average of 8 per month, while encounters with the police fall from 18.1 to an average of 8.8.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{previous}} {{suicide attempt}} {{is a potent}} risk factor for suicide later on. Crisis intervention, psychiatric and psychosocial evaluation at <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>facilities,</b> and follow-up care for suicide attempters are considered important components for suicide prevention. The Japanese Multimodal Intervention Trials for Suicide Prevention (J-MISP) includes a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial of post-suicide attempt case management {{for the prevention of}} further attempts (ACTION-J) to address the continuing increase in suicides in Japan. The primary aim of ACTION-J is to examine the effectiveness of an extensive intervention for suicide attempters in prevention of recurrent suicidal behavior, as compared with standard intervention. This paper describes the rationale and protocol of the ACTION-J trial. Methods/Design In this clinical trial, case management intervention will be provided at 19 <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>facilities</b> in Japan. After crisis intervention including psychiatric evaluation, psychosocial assessment, and psychological education, subjects will be randomly assigned to either a group receiving continuous case management or a control group receiving standard care. Suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and general health condition will be evaluated as secondary measures. The intervention was initiated in July 2006. By December, 2009, 842 subjects will be randomized. Subject follow-up will continue for 1. 5 to 5 years. Discussion Suicide is a complex phenomenon that encompasses multiple factors. Case management by multi-sector collaboration is needed. ACTION-J may provide valuable information on suicide attempters and may develop effective case management to reduce future risk for suicide attempters.
