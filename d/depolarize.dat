5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively <b>depolarize</b> the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

25|$|In all cases, {{illness is}} caused by the botulinum toxin {{produced}} by the bacterium C. botulinum in anaerobic conditions and not by the bacterium itself. The pattern of damage occurs because the toxin affects nerves that fire (<b>depolarize)</b> at a higher frequency first.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>depolarizing</b> {{blockers}} {{already have}} ACh-like actions, so these agents have prolonged effect {{under the influence}} of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Administration of <b>depolarizing</b> blockers initially produces fasciculations (a sudden twitch just before paralysis occurs). This is due to depolarization of the muscle. Also, post-operative pain is associated with <b>depolarizing</b> blockers.|$|R

25|$|The normal QRS axis is {{generally}} down {{and to the}} left, following the anatomical orientation of the heart within the chest. An abnormal axis suggests {{a change in the}} physical shape and orientation of the heart, or a defect in its conduction system that causes the ventricles to <b>depolarize</b> in an abnormal way.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to rising or falling levels of glucose, {{cells in the}} hypothalamus polarize or <b>depolarize.</b> Among the neuroendocrine reactions of {{the central nervous system}} to hypoglycemia is activation of the adrenergic responses of the autonomic nervous system. Glucokinase likely serves as a glucose signal here as well. Glucokinase has also been found in cells of the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} of post-synaptic depolarization in STDP indicates {{the importance of}} dendritic spikes. In general, post-synaptic depolarization occurs coincidentally with pre-synaptic activity when a backwards propagating signal reaches the post-synaptic membrane. Dendritic spikes allow backward propagating signals to reach and <b>depolarize</b> the post-synaptic membrane. The strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections is one proposed method of memory formation and learning.|$|E

50|$|<b>Depolarizing</b> {{blocking}} agents: These agents act by <b>depolarizing</b> the sarcolemma of {{the skeletal}} muscle fiber. This persistent depolarization makes the muscle fiber resistant to further stimulation by ACh.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two phases}} to the <b>depolarizing</b> block. During phase I (<b>depolarizing</b> phase), they cause muscular {{fasciculations}} (muscle twitches) {{while they are}} <b>depolarizing</b> the muscle fibers. Eventually, after sufficient depolarization has occurred, phase II (desensitizing phase) sets in and the muscle is no longer responsive to acetylcholine released by the motoneurons. At this point, full neuromuscular block has been achieved.|$|R
25|$|Spike-timing-dependent {{plasticity}} (STDP) {{refers to}} the functional changes in a neuron and its synapse due to time dependent action potentials. When an action potential reaches the pre-synaptic membrane it opens voltage-gated calcium channels causing an influx of calcium. The influx of calcium releases vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, usually glutamate, into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane opening ligand-gated channels causing the membrane to <b>depolarize.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aconitine can {{interact}} with the voltage-dependent sodium-ion channels, which are proteins in the cell membranes of excitable tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles and neurons. These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very fast to <b>depolarize</b> the cell membrane potential, causing the upstroke of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine alters signal {{conduction}} in neurons {{by blocking}} the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not <b>depolarize</b> and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain, but by stopping {{them before they}} begin. Careful titration allows for {{a high degree of}} selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other modalities of neuron signaling.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of <b>depolarized</b> patches of membrane during the excitation of single neurons in culture has been recorded with a high spatial resolution (1 micron 2 /pixel) imaging system based on a liquid-nitrogen-cooled astronomical camera mounted on an inverted microscope. Images were captured from rat nodose neurons stained with the voltage-sensitive dye RH 237. Conventional intracellular microelectrode recordings were made in synchrony with the images. During an action potential the fluorescence changes occurred in localized, unevenly distributed membrane areas, which formed clusters of <b>depolarized</b> sites of different sizes and intensities. When fast conductances were blocked {{by the addition of}} tetrodotoxin, a reduction in the number and the intensities of the <b>depolarized</b> sites was observed. The blockade by tetrodotoxin of voltage-clamped neurons also reduced the number of <b>depolarized</b> sites, although the same <b>depolarizing</b> voltage step was applied. Similarly, when a voltage-clamped neuron was <b>depolarized</b> by a constant-amplitude voltage step, the number of <b>depolarized</b> sites varied according to the degree of activation of the voltage-sensitive channels, which was modified by changing the holding potential. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of depolarization observed during excitation are related to the operations of ionic channels in the membrane...|$|R
50|$|Latency is {{decreased}} {{with an increased}} <b>depolarizing</b> current, which overruns the outward ohmic current and more quickly <b>depolarizes</b> the membrane. This more quickly activates the exponential growth of the Ca2+ spike. This reduction occurs more sharply with <b>depolarizing</b> currents closer to the threshold and more gradually as current injections are increased beyond threshold. Latency cannot be further reduced beyond a certain <b>depolarizing</b> current and becomes nearly uniform with any larger current. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that burst signaling as a result of LTS with stronger activating inputs is more stable than LTS due to near-threshold activating inputs.|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from single visual cells of the scallop, Pecten irradians. Two types of units are found. One type gives a graded, <b>depolarizing</b> response to light {{and the other a}} graded, hyperpolarizing response. The <b>depolarizing</b> cells are 2 – 3 log units more sensitive to light and have a longer latency than the hyperpolarizing type. At high light intensities the <b>depolarizing</b> cells are inactivated while the hyperpolarizing cells maintain their responses. When action potentials are seen they occur during illumination in <b>depolarizing</b> cells ("on" response) and after illumination in hyperpolarizing cells ("off" response). The evidence suggests that the <b>depolarizing</b> responses are from the microvilli-brearing proximal cells, and the hyperpolarizing responses from the ciliary-type distal cells of the retina, and that both responses are directly produced by light...|$|R
25|$|Before {{an action}} {{potential}} occurs, the axonal membrane {{is at its}} normal resting potential, and Na+ channels are in their deactivated state, blocked on the extracellular side by their activation gates. In response to an electric current (in this case, an action potential), the activation gates open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the neuron through the channels, and causing the voltage across the neuronal membrane to increase. Because the voltage across the membrane is initially negative, as its voltage increases to and past zero, {{it is said to}} <b>depolarize.</b> This increase in voltage constitutes the rising phase of an action potential.|$|E
25|$|Cells in the sinoatrial node, {{located in}} the right atrium of the heart, spontaneously <b>depolarize</b> {{approximately}} 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells {{have the ability to}} generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal sinus rhythm and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the heart rate. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{individuals}} with SP, {{there is almost}} no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for a stimulus to arouse the individual. There may also be a problem with the regulation of melatonin, which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations. Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep. Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would make it impossible for the sleep off neural populations to <b>depolarize</b> when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also an}} inward sodium current {{carried by}} cGMP-gated sodium channels. This {{so-called}} 'dark current' <b>depolarizes</b> the cell to around -40 mV. Note that this is significantly more <b>depolarized</b> than most other neurons.|$|R
40|$|In the {{crayfish}} neuromuscular junction, the {{excitatory transmitter}} is glutamate. The present {{study shows that}} at concentrations as low as 5 x 10 (- 7) M, glutamate affects the depolarization-evoked release of neurotransmitter. Furthermore, the effect of glutamate on release is voltage-dependent and depends {{on the level of}} the <b>depolarizing</b> pulse. Nerve terminals were exposed to 5 x 10 (- 7) M tetrodotoxin and then <b>depolarized</b> to different levels by a macropatch electrode. Depending on the amplitude of the <b>depolarizing</b> pulse, glutamate (5 x 10 (- 7) to 1 x 10 (- 5) M) had a dual effect on release. At small <b>depolarizing</b> pulses, glutamate reduced release, whereas at large <b>depolarizing</b> pulses, it enhanced it. Glutamate at 10 (- 6) M had no significant effect on action-potential-induced release. At 10 (- 4) M glutamate, the action-potential-induced release was always inhibited. N-Methyl-D-aspartate was found to mimic one of the effects of glutamate: N-methyl-D-aspartate (10 (- 7) to 10 (- 5) M) reduced release at small <b>depolarizing</b> pulses but had no effect with larger depolarizations. 2 -Amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid blocked the effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate...|$|R
50|$|The {{main idea}} of the proof is to rewrite the <b>depolarizing</b> channel as a convex {{combination}} of simpler channels, and use properties of those simpler channels to get the multiplicativity of the maximum output p-norm for the <b>depolarizing</b> channel.|$|R
2500|$|The excitability of a neuron at {{any point}} depends on the {{internal}} and external conditions of the cell at the time of stimulation. [...] Since a neuron typically receives multiple incoming signals at a time, the propagation of an action potential depends on the integration of all the incoming EPSPs and IPSPs arriving at the axon hillock. [...] If the summation of all excitatory and inhibitory signals <b>depolarize</b> the cell membrane to the threshold voltage, an action potential is fired. [...] Changing the intrinsic excitability of a neuron will change that neuron's function.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{potential}} generated at the axon hillock propagates as a wave along the axon. The currents flowing inwards {{at a point}} on the axon during an {{action potential}} spread out along the axon, and <b>depolarize</b> the adjacent sections of its membrane. If sufficiently strong, this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches. This basic mechanism was demonstrated by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin in 1937. After crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, he showed that an action potential arriving {{on one side of}} the block could provoke another action potential on the other, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short.* ...|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, action {{potentials}} {{result from}} an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously <b>depolarize</b> their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock. The voltage traces of such cells {{are known as}} pacemaker potentials. [...] The cardiac pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example. Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing. In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as bursting.|$|E
40|$|The <b>depolarized</b> radar echoes from Mars are modeled using a {{combination}} of remote-sensing observations. The model reproduces the variations of the total radar cross-sections with longitude observed by Goldstone (1986) along 7 S, yields larger magnitudes of total radar cross-sections along 22 N than those along 7 S, and produces <b>depolarized</b> echo spectra that broadly match those observed by the Arecibo radar in 1980 and 1982. The model indicates that volcanoes and lava plains of the Tharsis-Alba Patera, Elysium, and Amazonia regions have the strongest <b>depolarized</b> echoes from the entire planet. Rock populations for the moon and Mars are estimated assuming <b>depolarized</b> radar echoes result from rocks with radii between 1. 3 and three times the wavelength...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{patterns}} of membrane potential changes in laryngeal motoneurons (LMs) during vocalization, coughing, swallowing, sneezing, and the aspiration reflex in decerebrate paralyzed cats. LMs, identified by antidromic activation from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, were expiratory (ELMs) or inspiratory (ILMs) cells that <b>depolarized</b> during their respective phases in eupnea. During vocalization, most ELMs <b>depolarized</b> and most ILMs hyperpolarized. Some ILMs <b>depolarized</b> slightly during vocalization. During coughing, ELMs <b>depolarized</b> abruptly at {{the transition from the}} inspiratory to the expiratory phase. In one-third of ELMs, this depolarization persisted throughout the abdominal burst. In the remainder (“type A”), it was interrupted by a transient repolarization. ILMs exhibited a membrane potential trajectory opposite to that of type A ELMs during coughing. During swallowing, the membrane potential of ELMs decrease...|$|R
2500|$|Action {{potentials}} cannot propagate {{through the}} membrane in myelinated {{segments of the}} axon. [...] However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient to <b>depolarize</b> {{the first or second}} subsequent node of Ranvier. [...] Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one node of Ranvier provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent [...] "hopping" [...] of the action potential from node to node is known as saltatory conduction. [...] Although the mechanism of saltatory conduction was suggested in 1925 by Ralph Lillie, the first experimental evidence for saltatory conduction came from Ichiji Tasaki and Taiji Takeuchi* [...] and from Andrew Huxley and Robert Stämpfli.* [...] By contrast, in unmyelinated axons, the action potential provokes another in the membrane immediately adjacent, and moves continuously down the axon like a wave.|$|E
2500|$|Each action {{potential}} {{is followed by}} a refractory period, which can be divided into an absolute refractory period, during which it is impossible to evoke another {{action potential}}, and then a relative refractory period, during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required. These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules. When closing after an action potential, sodium channels enter an [...] "inactivated" [...] state, in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potential—this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state, it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open, making it difficult for the membrane potential to <b>depolarize,</b> and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period. Because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons, the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable.|$|E
2500|$|Action {{potentials}} {{are most}} commonly initiated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials from a presynaptic neuron. Typically, neurotransmitter molecules are {{released by the}} presynaptic neuron. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. [...] This binding opens various types of ion channels. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the cell membrane and, thus, the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory. [...] Whether the voltage is increased or decreased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the cable equation and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with {{the distance from the}} synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter. [...] Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the axon hillock and may (in rare cases) <b>depolarize</b> the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential. [...] More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must work together at nearly the same time to provoke a new action potential. [...] Their joint efforts can be thwarted, however, by the counteracting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.|$|E
