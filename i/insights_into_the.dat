40|$|This {{project is}} {{submitted}} as an examination paper. No responsibility {{can be held}} by London This project explores a curriculum’s ability to provide <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> functionality of a microcontroller based educational system. As a case study, the project worked exclusively with the Stamps in Class Educational Kit. Human factors evaluation methods {{were used to assess}} the curriculum’s ability to provide <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> functionality of the system. The factors preventing users from gaining <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> functionality of the system were isolated and discussed. Finally, solutions were provided in an attempt to eliminate or reduce the effect of the factors preventing users from gaining <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> functionality of the system. Naturalistic observation and objective textual analysis revealed that four factors prevented users from gaining <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> functionality of the system. First, frequent errors prevented users from completing the lessons. Second, a lack of text devoted to discussing the functionality of the system. Third, the invisibility of the system prevented users from observing the system in operation. Lastly, the limitations of a paper based curriculum prevented users from understanding the complex functionality of the system...|$|R

5|$|On the ground, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not be said for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tech defense.|$|E
