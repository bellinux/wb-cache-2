5|$|As of {{the general}} {{elections}} of 2014, {{a large majority of}} the members of Texas's U.S. House delegation are Republican, along with both U.S. Senators. In the 114th United States Congress, of the 36 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by Republicans and 11 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Since 1994, Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The state's <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Beaumont, and El Paso, as well as minority voters in East Texas and South Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led {{the effort}} to defeat Eleanor's son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., in the {{election}} for New York Attorney General. Eleanor grew increasingly disgusted with DeSapio's political conduct {{through the rest of}} the 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Voters,</b> a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E
5|$|Many state {{conventions}} elected delegates {{pledged to}} support bimetallism {{in the party}} platform. Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast, but had little luck elsewhere. Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland; the South Carolina convention denounced him. Cleveland issued a statement urging <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> to support gold—the next convention to be held, in Illinois, unanimously supported silver; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland's 1892 nomination. Gold and silver factions in some states, such as Bryan's Nebraska, sent rival delegations to the convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Proposition 218 {{received}} 62% {{support in}} the 26 California counties with a Republican voter registration advantage and 54% {{support in the}} 32 California counties with a <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> registration advantage during the November 1996 statewide election.|$|R

25|$|A Zogby poll {{released}} on August 15, 2008, indicated that most Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> wanted Barr {{to be included}} in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that almost 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.|$|E
25|$|Describing his Presidential hopes, Lieberman {{opined that}} his {{historically}} hawkish stance {{would appeal to}} voters. Indeed, he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of liberal <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters,</b> who dominated the primaries.|$|E
50|$|In the April 22 Pennsylvania primaries, {{enormous}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> turnout, {{most certainly}} {{due to the}} presidential race, led Carney to earn over 70,000 votes in the congressional primary, despite running unopposed—more than the combined vote in the Republican primary.|$|R
50|$|Tony Avella {{represents}} a Queens district on the New York City Council. Out {{of the nearly}} 400 write-in votes, almost half or 184 (representing about one <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> in 2,000) were some form or spelling of Mayor Michael Bloomberg.|$|R
50|$|Mike Davis is an American {{politician}} {{who served in}} the California State Assembly. Davis was declared the fourth most loyal <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> in the California State Legislature in the Sacramento Bee 2011-2012 listing. He voted against the Democratic Party only 2% of the time given over 3,500 of votes taken.|$|R
25|$|The FBI {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} alleged attempts to intimidate potential <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> in eight counties before the poll, by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted, {{a classic example of}} voter suppression.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, Palast said he'd {{received}} 500 emails {{that former}} White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove exchanged through an account {{supplied by the}} Republican National Committee. Palast says the emails show a plan to target likely <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> with extra scrutiny over their home addresses, and he also believes Rove's plan {{was a factor in}} the firing of U.S. Attorneys.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Van Hollen {{entered a}} {{competitive}} Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former Clinton administration aide Ira Shapiro. Though Shriver {{had the most}} money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters.</b> After receiving {{the endorsement of the}} Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.|$|E
50|$|Past presidential {{elections}} in Calaveras County have displayed preferences for Republican candidates; the last Democrat {{to win a}} majority in the county was Lyndon Johnson in 1964, although Democrat Bill Clinton lost the county by only 17 votes in 1992. By contrast, recent elections have seen a sharp upswing in <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> registrations.|$|R
2500|$|On August 21, 2006 a {{group of}} New Haven Democrats cited Connecticut General Statutes section 9-61 in a {{complaint}} filed with the New Haven <b>Democratic</b> Registrar of <b>Voters,</b> Sharon Ferrucci, demanding that she purge Lieberman from the <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> rolls. The statute reads in part: [...] "Knowingly becoming a candidate for office on ticket of a new party automatically separates voter from his former party." [...] Lieberman's campaign manager called it a [...] "dirty political trick". Ferrucci rejected the complaint.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{the voter}} {{registration}} firm Sproul & Associates defended itself from accusations {{that it was}} discarding the registration forms of Democrats after a past employee provided KLAS-TV with shredded forms and claimed this discarding was done {{as a matter of}} routine. Countering the allegation, Sproul & Associates proved that some <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> registrations had been properly submitted.|$|R
25|$|Bloomberg had a 49% {{approval}} rating in August 2010 compared to 56% in April, {{according to the}} New York Post. It also stated in August that 47% of <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> expressed approval compared to 55% of Republican voters. Lee Miringoff, director of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, has remarked that governing during a world economic recession coupled with his stance {{in support of the}} Islamic complex near Ground Zero dampens Bloomberg's support.|$|E
25|$|Once a Democratic bastion, the {{district}} became more conservative {{over the years}} and finally elected a Republican in 1998. The 2001 reapportionment made {{the district}} more compact and Republican than previously, though it was far less Republican than the neighboring 4th District. Although there was some movement in registration in favor of the Democrats, it still had a strong GOP flavor as most of Sacramento's <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> lived in the neighboring 5th District.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} time since 1966 that an {{incumbent}} Tennessee congressman had lost a primary. It was also the first time since 1950 that an incumbent congressman lost a primary in Tennessee's 1st congressional district. Davis said he thinks <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters,</b> knowing they had no realistic chance of defeating him in November, contributed to his Republican 1st District primary loss, and he believes he was the winner among voters who identify as Republicans. Tennessee has an open primary system.|$|E

25|$|Social liberals (modern liberals) and {{progressives}} {{constitute the}} majority of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> base. Liberals thereby form the largest united demographic within the Democratic base. According to the 2012 exit poll results, liberals constituted 25% of the electorate, and 86% of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic Party. White-collar college-educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s; they now compose a vital component of the Democratic Party.|$|R
25|$|The fast-growing I-4 {{corridor}} area, {{which runs}} through Central Florida and connects {{the cities of}} Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters.</b> The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion {{of the state and}} the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state of Florida in presidential elections.|$|E
25|$|In the 1986 statewide Democratic primaries, <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> {{nominated}} {{allies of}} Lyndon LaRouche for Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State. Stevenson objected to their platform {{and refused to}} appear on the same ticket. Instead, he organized the Solidarity Party to provide an alternate slate for Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, which was endorsed by the regular Democratic organization. Persuading Democrats to vote for most of the Democratic ticket as well as the Solidarity candidates for Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of State was an unconventional strategy; however, Stevenson and the candidate for Lieutenant Governor position, Mike Howlett, won 40% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Hillary Clinton led Barack Obama by 20 {{points in}} pre-primary polls in New Hampshire {{prior to the}} Iowa caucuses, but had fallen behind Obama by 13 points in the week prior to the New Hampshire primary. However, she rebounded to get more votes than Obama in the New Hampshire primary, winning by 3 percent. According to exit polls, female voters and elderly voters helped her win this {{particular}} race. In the Iowa caucuses, Obama received 35 percent of the female vote, while Clinton only received 30 percent. In New Hampshire, however, 45 percent supported Clinton, compared to 36 percent for Obama. Also during the primary, older voters outnumbered younger voters; 67 percent of <b>Democratic</b> <b>voters</b> were {{over the age of}} 40, and most of them supported Clinton.|$|E
50|$|Caliguiri {{won by a}} {{particularly}} large margin, eclipsing 80% of the vote, a figure that even surpasses the city's heavily <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> registration advantage. This is {{in part due to}} the particularly polarizing nature of Republican candidate Fred Goehringer, a KDKA broadcaster. Goehringer was a Barry Goldwater admirer but campaigned against Caligiuri's Renaissance III corporate benefits, alienating some GOP power brokers. A total of 83,683 votes were cast.|$|R

5000|$|A 2016 study argued that, {{although}} no clear-cut relationship exists between strict voter ID laws and voter turnout, the disenfranchising impact of voter ID laws may be hidden by <b>Democratic</b> <b>voter</b> mobilization. Strong negative reactions to voter ID laws among Democratic constituencies could, in theory, boost Democratic turnout enough {{to compensate for}} effects of the laws themselves. A 2007 report found a small increase in Democratic turnout in places with new voter ID laws.|$|R
