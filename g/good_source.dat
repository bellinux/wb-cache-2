5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved.

5|$|Roberto Guerro is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss voiced and motion-captured by actor JB Blanc. A decade before Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'état. He escaped execution by the new regime and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without a <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of funds he {{would be unable to}} compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash.|$|E

5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%.

5|$|Reviews {{of fiction}} and popular science books were published, {{and there was}} a science column which {{endeavored}} to answer readers' questions. These features were at first of good quality, but deteriorated after Lasser's departure, although it is not certain that Lasser wrote the content of either one. An influential non-fiction initiative was the creation of the Science Fiction League, an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across the country. Gernsback took the opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia, and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as a <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of publicity. It was ultimately more important in becoming one of the foundations of science fiction fandom.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided a <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists {{in a written statement}} known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E
