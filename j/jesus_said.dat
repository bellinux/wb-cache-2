25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. <b>Jesus</b> <b>said</b> to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

500|$|The second vocal {{movement}} {{is a similar}} combination of ideas, now mostly from the New Testament. It quotes twice what <b>Jesus</b> <b>said</b> on the cross according to the Gospel of Luke. The first quotation (3a), [...] "" [...] (Into Your hands I commit my spirit), with an added explanation [...] "" [...] (You have redeemed me, Lord, faithful God), from Psalm 31, is rendered as an alto aria.|$|E

2500|$|After {{having said}} all the above, <b>Jesus</b> <b>said</b> to Peter, [...] "Follow me" [...] (John 21:19).

2500|$|Verse 66 is a {{quote from}} Psalm [...] [...] Many writers of the New Testament used this Psalm to sum up their {{understanding}} of Jesus' death {{as part of his}} role as the messiah. [...] It is notable that the Hebrew word for son, ben, is almost the same as stone, eben, which might be what generated seeing Jesus as a stone. Since the synoptics state <b>Jesus</b> <b>said</b> this in the Temple, this could reflect their view of Jesus as replacing the function of the Temple, bringing God's presence to humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church sees as {{the main}} basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the Synoptic Gospels ( [...] ; [...] ) and Saint Paul's [...] ) recount that in that context <b>Jesus</b> <b>said</b> of what to all {{appearances}} were bread and wine: [...] "This is my body … this is my blood." [...] The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
2500|$|Jesus {{looked around}} and said to his disciples, [...] "How hard {{it is for the}} rich to enter the kingdom of God!" [...] The disciples were amazed at his words.
