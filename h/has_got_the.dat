25|$|Until {{the time}} the soul is liberated from the saṃsāra (cycle of {{repeated}} birth and death), it gets attached {{to one of these}} bodies based on the karma (actions) of the individual soul.

The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of siddha (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.|$|E
25|$|Ground stone adzes {{are still}} in use {{by a variety of}} people in Irian Jaya (Indonesia), Papua New Guinea and some of the smaller Islands of Melanesia and Micronesia. The hardstone is ground on a {{riverine}} rock with the help of water until it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> desired shape. It is then fixed to a natural grown angled wood with resin and plant fibers. The shape and manufacture of these adzes is similar to those found from the Neolithic stone age in Europe. A variety of minerals are used. Their everyday use is on a steady decline, as it is much more convenient to cut fire wood using imported steel axes or machetes. However, certain ceremonial crafts such as making canoes, ceremonial shields, masks, drums, containers or communal houses etc. may require the use of traditional-made stone adzes.|$|E

500|$|He has, at times, been criticised for {{his passing}} ability. As well {{as not being}} able to channel his {{aggression}} into a more productive manner, he has also been criticised for his disciplinary record due to his tough tackling style and his lack of goalscoring since joining Celtic. The Daily Telegraph noted in the lead-up to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final that Brown had only scored six goals in the previous two seasons, but had received eighteen yellow cards and two red cards. After captaining Scotland to an away win over Poland in March 2014, the Scotland national manager described Brown as [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "He's ungainly in a way but he does what all good midfielders do: pass the ball, keep it, move it on.

500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in the downpour, chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into {{the far corner of the}} goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills he <b>has</b> <b>got,</b> <b>the</b> moves he makes, are something you like to watch and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E

Hughes' team was embarrassed by a loss in their first match against Zimbabwe, at the time a mainly amateur side.

In his absence the Australian team was {{dismissed}} for 129 and bundled out of the tournament. Hughes decision {{to pull out of the}} match drew some criticism from the Australian press: [...] "Hughes decision not to play was lamentable [...] this Australian team does not have a capable leader." [...] On his return to Australia, David Hookes publicly advocated for Rod Marsh to be appointed Australian captain in Hughes' place, saying on Adelaide radio, [...] "Maybe Kim has got to be an apprentice to someone everyone respects." [...] Hughes replied 'It's nice to know the Australian captain <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> support of his vice-captain."

2500|$|When Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), {{landlord}} of The Queen Victoria pub, {{decides to}} start a pub football team, he struggles {{to get people to}} sign up. His wife Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) takes over as manager and flirts to get people to sign up. After the first match, they host a party and Kat flirts with her chef Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), former lover Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) and brothers Max (Jake Wood), Jack (Scott Maslen) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen person enters and he and Kat have sex. She feels guilty the next day and tries to ignore his calls and text messages. She finally responds to a phone call and meets him to ask him to leave her alone. However, as he walks away she changes her mind and they continue the affair. She then fears Alfie will find out so tries to end the affair again. Her lover sends her a mobile phone to contact him on, but she bins it. However, when a romantic evening with Alfie goes wrong, she retrieves the phone and contacts her lover. She later receives a key to a nearby flat, and when Alfie pays more attention to the organisation of the football team, Kat heads to the flat to meet her lover, who is waiting. The affair continues with Alfie clueless. Kat hears that a fight has broken out between members of the football team, and fears that the truth has come out. However, it has not. The fight spills over into The Queen Victoria, and later, Kat tends to her lover's wounds. Alfie catches them but is none the wiser. The mystery man later leaves Kat a bandage with [...] "I love you" [...] written on in lipstick. Kat hides it in with some laundry. Alfie then asks Kat to move out following an outbreak of bed bugs in the pub. She does not want to go as she does not want to continue her affair, but she cannot resist. Alfie later finds the bandage, but assumes it is from Kat and sends her a message in the pub's window saying [...] "I love you 2". Kat later ignores her lover's messages, and he tells her that he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> message—that she is no longer interested. She throws away the key, but it is found by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who leaves it on the bar, thinking it belongs to a punter. Kat then takes it and later meets her lover at the flat. Kat ends up staying the night and gets her friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) to cover for her the next day. Kat receives flowers from her lover, and tells Alfie they are from her father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin). Kat angrily telephones her lover, telling him she will always contact him. Alfie then grows suspicious, as Charlie would not send roses to Kat, and asks her to be honest with him. Kat then admits to having an affair. Alfie demands to know the details but Kat refuses to tell him who her lover is. Alfie ejects Kat from their home, where she meets Michael, to whom she discloses the affair. He urges Kat to fix her relationship, so she goes back to Alfie and says she will do anything to make it right. He gets her to phone her lover and tell him that the affair is over for good. After this, she smashes her phone and the couple go away on a [...] "make or break" [...] holiday.|$|E
