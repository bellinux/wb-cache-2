5|$|On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines {{landing at}} Værnes {{en route from}} Bodø Airport was written off after a hard landing on the runway. This {{was caused by a}} high sink rate caused by the pilot {{interrupting}} the landing checklist and <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> arm the spoilers. No-one was killed in the accident.|$|E
5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> tie a safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training {{hard for the}} World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E

He <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> pack his spare wand, he <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> lock his {{laboratory}} door and <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> take his nephew Slightly with him. To make matters worse, a sunburned dragon has run off with the Princess Croak and the spell cabinet has been knocked over spreading the spells everywhere.|$|R
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. <b>Forgetting</b> <b>to</b> set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} hand-washing in the health-care setting {{is to remove}} {{pathogenic}} microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them. The New England Journal of Medicine reports {{that a lack of}} hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> wash their hands before touching patients. One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.|$|E

The vote was originally recorded as 78 votes in favour and three abstentions, due to the National Party whips <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> cast proxy votes in favour for John Banks and Peter Dunne (both National Party whips voted against the bill and therefore were in the wrong lobby to cast votes in favour).|$|E

Michelle was known for being the housemate to get the most such fines - $65,000.

25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication or go to a doctor appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Helen battles a {{compulsive}} eating habit that {{caused her to}} be obese in her youth. Though successful at losing the weight sometime after Brian eloped with Carol, {{it is still a}} specter in her life and a blight on her self-image. She has been a lifelong friend of both Hackett brothers and dreamed of marrying Joe from a young age. Helen married Antonio to prevent him from being deported. Although Antonio won Green Card Lottery and agreed to end the marriage, when Helen tried to marry Joe she realized she could be charged with bigamy due to <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> submit the divorce papers. At the season finale of the sixth season, Helen is finally able to marry Joe.|$|E

25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E
25|$|The Vizier {{wanted and}} did {{everything}} he could to get Yahya executed. The Sultan prohibited his execution but approved only to deprive him from his offices, which Rüstem Pasha did in the most offensive manner. As a member of the askeri class, apparently he could not be left to starve. In order to escape persecution, Yahya went to exile back in the Balkans, without <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> write a satirical lament on Rustem Pasha after his death. There are divergences on the location where he was sent. According to some sources, he took over an fief near Zvornik in today's Bosnia and lived pretty well afterwards receiving a 27,000 or 30,000 akçe annual income. Others point to Tamışvar, center of the Province of Temeşvar, where he for sure fought at a certain point. Though not young anymore, he took part together with his men at the siege of Szigetvar in 1565. There he wrote a qasida and presented it to Sultan Suleiman. After that, due to his age, he turned to Islamic Mysticism.|$|E
25|$|Soon enough {{she finds}} herself outside the Weylin {{plantation}} in a rainstorm, a very drunk Rufus lying face down in a puddle. She tries to drag {{him back to the}} house, then gets Nigel to help her carry him. Back at the house, an aged Weylin appoints Dana to nurse Rufus back to health under threat of her life. Suspecting Rufus has malaria and knowing she cannot help much, Dana feeds Rufus the aspirin she has packed to lower his fever. Rufus survives, but remains weak for weeks. Dana learns that Rufus and Alice have had three children and that only one, a boy named Joe, has survived, though Alice is pregnant again. Rufus had forced Alice to let the doctor bleed the other two when they had fallen ill, inadvertently killing them. Weylin has a heart attack and when Dana is unable to save his life, Rufus sends her to work in the corn fields as punishment. By the time Rufus repents his decision, she has collapsed from exhaustion and is being whipped. Rufus then appoints Dana as the caretaker of his ailing mother, Margaret. Now the master of the plantation, Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, Weylin's former concubine. When Dana grows angry with him for the sale, Rufus explains that his father left debts he must pay. He then convinces Dana to use her writing talent to stave off his other creditors, despite the fact that Dana abhors secretarial work, and once had a fight with Kevin about typing his manuscripts. Time passes and Alice gives birth to a girl, Hagar, who is Dana’s direct ancestor. Alice confides to Dana that she plans to run away with her children as soon as possible, as she fears that she is <b>forgetting</b> <b>to</b> hate Rufus. Dana convinces Rufus to let her teach his son Joe and some of the slave children how to read. However, when a slave named Sam asks Dana if his younger siblings can join in on the lessons, Rufus sells him away as punishment for flirting with her. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. Faced with her own powerlessness over Rufus, she retrieves the knife she has brought from home and slits her wrists in an effort to time travel.|$|E
