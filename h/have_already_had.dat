25|$|Diabetics, despite {{not having}} {{clinically}} detectable atherosclerotic disease, have more severe debility from atherosclerotic events over time than non-diabetics who <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> atherosclerotic events.

25|$|The drugs {{most likely}} to be causing the {{reaction}} should be tested as late as possible (and possibly need not be tested at all). This avoids rechallenging patients with a drug to which they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a (possibly) dangerous adverse reaction.|$|E
25|$|Several {{terms are}} in common use, {{especially}} {{within the community}} itself relating to the surgical or operative status {{of someone who is}} transsexual, depending on whether they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> SRS, have not had SRS but still intend to, or do not intend to have SRS. They are, post-op, pre-op, and non-op, respectively.|$|E

25|$|It {{occurs in}} between 1:5,000 and 1:100,000 in {{procedures}} involving general anaesthesia. This disorder occurs worldwide and affects all racial groups.

25|$|On January 21, 2016, the resort's {{management}} structure was changed, with general managers within {{a theme park}} being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the total}} {{fertility}} rate in Madagascar {{is experiencing a}} decrease, {{the large number of}} women of child-bearing age has ensured that population momentum will cause the total number of births to increase. This effect is expected to have subsided within 30 years. Approximately a third of Malagasy women under the age 19 <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> at least one child, and most breastfeed, with 51 percent breastfeeding exclusively for six months.|$|E
25|$|Space {{agencies}} <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> {{experience with}} returning samples {{thought to be}} a back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon. The precautions taken then were inadequate by modern standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different approach would be needed for a modern sample return.|$|E
25|$|Emanuel co-wrote, The {{complete}} lives system discriminates against older people. Age-based allocation is ageism. Unlike allocation by sex or race, allocation by age is not invidious discrimination; {{every person}} lives through different life stages {{rather than being}} a single age. Even if 25-year-olds receive priority over 65-year-olds, everyone who is 65 years now was previously 25 years. Treating 65-year-olds differently because of stereotypes or falsehoods would be ageist; treating them differently because they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> more life-years is not.|$|E

25|$|Globally, {{symptomatic}} HAV {{infections are}} believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year. About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries {{have higher levels of}} circulation. Most adolescents and adults in developing countries <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> the disease, thus are immune. Adults in midlevel countries may be at risk of disease with the potential of being exposed.|$|E
25|$|The Culture, living {{mostly on}} massive spaceships and in {{artificial}} habitats, and also feeling {{no need for}} conquest in the typical sense of the word, possesses no borders. Its sphere of influence is better defined by the (current) concentration of Culture ships and habitats {{as well as the}} measure of effect its example and its interventions <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> on the 'local' population of any galactic sector. As the Culture is also a very graduated and constantly evolving society, its societal boundaries are also constantly in flux (though they tend to be continually expanding during the novels), peacefully 'absorbing' societies and individuals.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E

25|$|Those in the {{uppermost}} {{ranks of the}} division and thus slated for a possible advancement may have a match with those in jūryō, either {{as one of the}} seven matches they are expected to compete in, or occasionally in addition to the matches they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had.</b> This eighth match is sometimes required as a result of tournament withdrawals due to injury of sekitori, and is usually given to makushita wrestler who have achieved a 3–4 or worse record in their regular seven bouts. It is ignored if one loses and counted if one wins, making it a true bonus bout for a makushita wrestler. In such a match-up the makushita wrestler will have his hair fashioned into a full oicho-mage as sekitori do but continues to wear his plain cotton mawashi.|$|E
25|$|Carotid endarterectomy or carotid {{angioplasty}} {{can be used}} {{to remove}} atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases. Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis {{has been shown to be}} useful in preventing further strokes in those who <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> one. Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful. People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person's preferences. Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long —the risk of recurrent stroke in a patient who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one patient was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.|$|E
