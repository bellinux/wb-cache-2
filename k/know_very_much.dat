500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E
2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} US Congress, the Deputy Legal Advisor of the US State Department, George Aldrich said the Indonesians [...] "were armed roughly 90 percent with our equipment. ... {{we really did}} not <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Maybe {{we did not want}} to <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> but I gather that for a time we did not know." [...] Indonesia was never {{informed}} of the supposed US [...] "aid suspension". David T. Kenney, Country Officer for Indonesia in the US State Department, also testified before Congress that one purpose for the arms was [...] "to keep that area [...] peaceful." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{a ridiculous}} {{question}} you ask me. My poor partner, you don't seem to <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about the ice business.|$|E
50|$|Isobel Turbot - The oldest {{daughter}} of Sir Edwin Turbot. <b>Knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about life.|$|R
6000|$|Deane {{shook his}} head slowly. [...] "No one <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about him," [...] he said. [...] "They were out in South Africa together. It was there, perhaps, that their quarrel, if they had one, started." ...|$|R
50|$|Diego de San Pedro (c. 1437 - c. 1498) was a Castilian writer {{about whom}} no one <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{other than what}} {{he says in his}} works. Scholars also rely on what they infer from the context in which he wrote them and the many nobles to whom he has been linked.|$|R
6000|$|I did not <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> French, but I {{had enough}} to make that out. What sort of eagle was this which had flown into our humble little nest? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo, [...] "now I {{understand}} it. I {{wished to}} <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> what it meant, and I {{had a great}} mind to go and ask the helmsman." ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived {{here all}} safe about 9 P.M. yesterday. No war news. General Grant {{does not seem}} to <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about Yeatman, but thinks very well of him so far as he does know.|$|E
60|$|So {{the talk}} ran on, {{but the more}} he was opposed, the more headstrong did Larry become--and that, as old readers <b>know,</b> was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like him.|$|R
6000|$|About Reynolds's life neither time nor space permits {{me to say}} <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> if I <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> which I don't. He {{was the son of}} {{a master}} in one of our large schools. He went to the Bar. He married a sister of Thomas Hood. He wrote, like Hood, in the London Magazine. With Hood for ally, he {{published}} [...] "Odes and Addresses to Great People;" [...] the third edition, which I have here, is of 1826. The late relations of the brothers-in-law were less happy; possibly the ladies of their families quarrelled; that is usually the way of the belligerent sex.|$|R
60|$|I {{had almost}} {{said that if}} any one knew {{anything}} of scent, it is the farmer; but of scent I believe that not even the farmer knows anything. But he <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as to the lie of the country, and should my gentle reader by chance have taken a glass or two of wine above ordinary over night, the effect of which will possibly be a temporary distaste to straight riding, no one's knowledge as {{to the line of}} the lanes is so serviceable as that of the farmer.|$|R
6000|$|And next {{he would}} bethink {{himself of the}} readers of these books. [...] "These people," [...] he would say, [...] "do not <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about books, which, indeed, is why I am giving them this library." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a short rapid," [...] remarked Nasmyth reflectively. [...] "There is, no doubt, a {{great deal}} of the hardest kind of rock under it, which is, in one or two respects, unfortunate. I suppose you don't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about geology?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Your {{throwing}} out the wine gave me a hint, because {{it was obvious that}} somebody had been getting after you before, and there were other matters. But you're rather young and I suspect you're up against a big thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's quite a gentleman, you <b>know,</b> and <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{thought of}} in the world. It won't be at all bad for her, poor thing. It is so very hard for a girl to get married {{nowadays}} without money." ...|$|R
6000|$|He gave {{a melancholy}} sigh and {{stood looking at}} her a moment, with his hands behind him, giving short nervous shakes to his hunting-crop. [...] "Do you <b>know</b> I'm <b>very</b> <b>much</b> afraid of it--of that {{remarkable}} mind of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I mean it now. Do you <b>know,</b> I <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{doubt if}} one of us will be alive to-morrow night. We shall be {{attacked}} in overwhelming force, and it is quite a chance if we can hold this place." ...|$|R
60|$|He had his arm {{raised for}} a cut, and three {{parts of his}} body open to my point, for he did not <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{about the use of}} the sword. As I brought my hilt to the salute he dropped his hand and stared at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} quit and try farming. After all, I don't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about {{railroad}} building; up to now I've got on rather by determination than knowledge. Then, if I stop with you, I'll come up against a locked door whenever I try to push ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} Silverbridge people,--do you?" [...] asked Mr. Toogood. Eames {{said that he}} did not. He had been at Silverbridge more than once, but did not <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> of the Silverbridgians. [...] "Because Walker is coming to dine here. Walker is the leading man in Silverbridge." ...|$|E
40|$|Whenever I {{find myself}} {{down in the}} dumps, I turn on public radio and I’m {{instantly}} cheered, comforted, or outraged, any one of which can restore me to my normally jovial and gregarious self. But it was the juxtaposition of these first two odd snippets that flummoxed me into wondering if the average personreally <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about what scientists do or how they do it. Here, on the one hand, is a Canadian taxpayer, so utterly confused about what universities are for—the role they play in innovation, and in training {{the next generation of}} scientists [ [...] . ...|$|R
60|$|A bank-note of L20 was the enclosure, and {{the whole}} {{incident}} left me speechless with astonishment. I am not able to read over {{the beginning of my}} own letter, which forms the introduction to this extraordinary communication. I only know that, though mixed with a quantity of foolery (God <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> different from my present feelings), it gives an account sufficiently accurate, of the mysterious person from whom this letter comes, and that I have neither time nor patience to separate the absurd commentary from the text, which it is so necessary you should know.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't exactly my trouble, Uncle Barney. It's {{somebody}} else's," [...] went on {{the oldest}} Rover boy. [...] "A young lady I <b>know</b> is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> worried over something, and she has asked me if I can't {{do something to help}} her get rid of that worry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might have}} been worse," [...] he declared. [...] "Stephen wasn't pleased, of course. He hates women like poison, and he always will. That is because he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about them, and because he will insist upon {{dwelling}} upon certain unhappy incidents of our family history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not used}} to being interviewed myself," [...] he said slowly, [...] "so I don't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about it. We're both green hands together, I imagine. But I'd like to help you out, so I don't mind telling you what I think about this bill, and its bearing on certain {{important}} interests." ...|$|E
60|$|I had not {{supposed}} {{that the people}} of Benedict would <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> concerning what was going on {{at the lower end of}} the bay; but the Avenger was hardly more than at anchor when I understood that we could have gone to no better place in order to learn what was being done.|$|E
500|$|While {{choosing}} a species for Perry, Povenmire and Marsh {{wanted to keep}} in mind selecting one that was uncommon, an animal that kids could not [...] "pick out at a pet store and beg [...] for." [...] They chose a platypus because of the animal's obscure and striking appearance. The animal was scarcely used in American animated programs, so the pair opined that Perry [...] "would not have to compete with preconceived notions that viewers might bring to a more conventional critter." [...] The blank storyboard they were given allowed them to [...] "make stuff up" [...] since [...] "no one <b>knows</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about [...]" ...|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago if you’d asked me about Congo I wouldn’t have <b>known</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about it. I knew where it was located on the world map… the {{geographical}} world map. As for the social, political, cultural, economical world map, I didn’t quite know where to place it. My interest in violence against women around the world, however, brought Congo to my attention more than once {{during the second half}} of the 2000 s, and sooner rather than later, I was able to locate Congo on one particular map: the world map of violence against women as the “rape capital of the world”[1]...|$|R
40|$|Papal {{letters were}} issued for the {{specific}} purpose of authorizing and encouraging the Albigensian crusade; their purpose was never to inform the reader or listener {{about the nature of}} Cathar beliefs or their origins. Indeed it is very likely that neither Innocent III nor Honorius III <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about the dualist heresy against which they authorized their crusade. In order to find detailed information on what this prominent group of heretics, popularly called 'Cathars', did and did not believe, who they were and where their beliefs and practices originated, we must look for answers not in papal documents but in other primary sources from the period...|$|R
60|$|Frances Farquhar was {{a beauty}} and was {{sometimes}} called a society butterfly {{by people who}} didn't <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about it. Her father was wealthy and her mother came of an extremely blue-blooded family. Frances had been out for three years, and was a social favourite. Consequently, it may be wondered why she was unhappy.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just my anguish--and your advantage. It's awfully curious," [...] Vanderbank {{went on to}} Nanda, [...] "but I feel as if I must {{figure to}} him, you <b>know,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as Mr. Longdon figures to me. Mr. Longdon doesn't somehow get into me. Yet I do, I think, into him. But we don't matter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{claim to}} <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> of {{military}} movements," [...] {{the man said}} grimly, having satisfied his curiosity regarding our personal appearance; [...] "but {{it seems to me}} you might have waited a little with the belief that the rebels are bound to make their way inside those lines whatever my Lord Cornwallis may do in opposition." ...|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{before these}} events, in 1908, {{he went to}} Istanbul and, very certainly, met there with the sultan's brother Rachîd or the sultan Abdûl-Hamid himself. On the other hand, he {{returned}} several times to Paris and met with his brother Rachîd Moutran, obviously constructing political connections between certain groups of the Young Turks and the conservative groups around the sultan. During his financial difficulties, {{in the beginning of}} 1907, he also became the object of false accusations and calumny by the French actress Mme Carlier. Perhaps, this was part of a political intrigue against him, because he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about the Young Turks movement.|$|R

60|$|Nothing on {{that evening}} was {{said about the}} Clock House, or about Priscilla's intentions. Priscilla was up early on the next morning, {{intending}} to discuss it in the garden with Hugh before breakfast; but Hugh was aware of her purpose and avoided her. It was his intention to speak first to his mother; and though his mother was, as he <b>knew,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in awe of her daughter, he thought that he might carry his point, at any rate {{for the next three}} months, by forcing an assent from the elder lady. So he managed to waylay Mrs. Stanbury before she descended to the parlour.|$|R
