40|$|The need to {{translate}} paper documents into electronic form demanded a development of methods and algorithms for automatic processing systems and web publishing unformatted graphic documents of on-line libraries. Translation of scanned images into modern formats of electronic documents using OCR programmes faces serious difficulties. These difficulties are {{connected with the}} standardization set of fonts and design of printed documents. There is also a need to maintain the original form of electronic format of such documents. The article discusses the possibility for building an extensible adaptive dictionary of graphic objects, which constitute unformatted graphics <b>documents.</b> <b>Dictionary</b> automatically adjusted as graphics processing and accumulation of statistical information for each new document. This adaptive extensible dictionary of graphic letters, fonts, and other objects of automated particular document processing is called "auto-adaptive font", {{and a set of}} its application methods is named "auto-adaptive font technology. " Based on the theory of estimation algorithms, a mathematical model is designed. It allows us to represent all objects of unformatted graphic document in a unified manner to build a feature vector for each object, and evaluate a similarity of these objects in the selected metric. The algorithm of the adaptive models of graphic images is developed and a criterion for combining similar properties in one element to build an auto-adaptive font is offered thus allowing us to build a software core of hardware-software complex for processing the unformatted graphic documents. A standard block diagram of hardware-software complex is developed to process the unformatted graphic documents. The article presents a description of all the blocks of this complex, including document processing station and its interaction with the web server of publishing electronic documents. </p...|$|R

As a literary <b>document,</b> a <b>dictionary</b> can also provide us with social information of a particular age in which the compilation the dictionary takes place. Dr. Johnson’s A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), the most influential dictionary {{in the history of}} the English language, is taken for the study to find out how women are presented through the definitions of the women related words. The English language is regarded by the feminists as “man-made ” that reflects the cultural values of men. The study is an attempt to find out sexism in English language reflected in the selected dictionary by Dr. Johnson which can also provide a clear picture of the social status of women in the 18 th century where the compilation of the dictionary took place...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} {{and use of}} electronic resources for both manual and automated language related processing has increased tremendously in recent years. Nevertheless, many resources still exist only in printed form, restricting their {{availability and}} use. This especially holds true in low density languages or languages with limited electronic resources. For these documents, automated conversion into electronic resources is highly desirable. This thesis focuses on the semi-automated conversion of printed structured <b>documents</b> (<b>dictionaries</b> in particular) to usable electronic representations. In the first part we present an entry tagging system that recognizes, parses, and tags the entries of a printed dictionary to reproduce the representation. The system uses the consistent layout {{and structure of the}} dictionaries, and the features that impose this structure, to capture and recover lexicographic information. We accomplish this by adapting two methods: rule-based and HMM-based. The system is designed to produce results quickly with minimal human assistance and reasonable accuracy. The use of an adaptive transformation-based learning as a post-processor at two points in the system yields significant improvements, even with an extremely small amount of user provided training data. The second part of this thesis presents Morphology Induction from Noisy Data (MIND), a natural language morphology discovery framework that operates on information from limited, noisy data obtained from the conversion process. To use the resulting resources effectively, however, users must be able to search for them using the root form of morphologically deformed variant found in the text. Stemming and data driven methods are not suitable when data are sparse. The approach is based on the novel application of string searching algorithms. The evaluations show that MIND can segment words into roots and affixes from the noisy, limited data contained in a dictionary, and it can extract prefixes, suffixes, circumfixes, and infixes. MIND can also identify morphophonemic changes, i. e., phonemic variations between allomorphs of a morpheme, specifically point-of-affixation stem changes. This, in turn, allows non-native speakers to perform multilingual tasks for applications where response must be rapid, and they have limited knowledge. In addition, this analysis can feed other natural language processing tools requiring lexicons...|$|R
