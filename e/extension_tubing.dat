5000|$|A winged {{infusion}} set—also {{known as}} [...] "butterfly" [...] or [...] "scalp vein" [...] set—is a device specialized for venipuncture: i.e. for accessing a superficial vein for either intravenous injection or phlebotomy. It consists, {{from front to}} rear, of a hypodermic needle, two bilateral flexible [...] "wings", flexible small-bore transparent tubing (often 20-35 cm long), and lastly a connector (often female Luer). This connector attaches to another device: e.g. syringe, vacuum tube holder/hub, or <b>extension</b> <b>tubing</b> from an infusion pump or gravity-fed infusion / transfusion bag/bottle.|$|E
40|$|During anaesthesia, {{drugs are}} {{frequently}} adminis-tered i. v. via the self-sealing rubber injection site at the patient {{end of an}} i. v. administration set. If, during surgery, {{the position of the}} i. v. cannula is inaccessible, the injection site can be moved to a more convenient place by the use of <b>extension</b> <b>tubing.</b> When this was done during clinical investigations involving neostigmine, it was noted that, on several occasions following its injection, there was an unexpected delay of over 6 min before the effect of neostigmine was seen. Therefore it was decided to investigate the delivery time of drugs injected via <b>extension</b> <b>tubing</b> and to see how this varied with the rate of the i. v. infusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental investigation A 1 -litre container of physiological saline was connected to a cannula (Abbocath 16 -gauge) via a standard i. v. fluid administration set (Avon Medicals type A 100) and <b>extension</b> <b>tubing</b> (Avon Medicals type A 60, length 1250 mm, volume 15 ml) as shown in figure 1. The infusion rate was controlled over a wide range by raising or lowering the bag of saline and adjusting a gate clamp on the tubing of the giving set. Injections were made with physiological saline coloured with bromophenol blue, the concentration of which was measured by absorption at 590 nm on a u. v. spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments type CE 595). The following procedure was used to establish the delivery time of a given fraction of the injectate. First, the nominal infusion rate was set by adjusting the gate clamp on the tubing (fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{materials}} such as polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are widely used in double-lumen <b>extension</b> <b>tubing.</b> The purposes of our study were to 1) compare in vitro drug delivery through the double extension tubes available on the market 2) assess the plastic properties of PUR in infusion devices {{and their impact on}} drug delivery. The study compared eight double-lumen extension tubes in PUR, co-extruded (PE/PVC) plastic and plasticised PVC from different manufacturers. Isosorbide dinitrate and diazepam were used as model compounds to evaluate their sorption on the internal surface of the infusion device. Control experiments were performed using norepinephrine known not to absorb to plastics. Drug concentrations delivered at the egress of extension tubes were determined over time by an analytical spectrophotometric UV-Vis method. The main characteristics of plastics were also determined. Significant differences in the sorption phenomenon were observed among the eight double-lumen extension tubes and between pairs of extension tubes. Mean concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate delivered at the egress of double-lumen extension tubes after a 150 -minute infusion (mean values ± standard deviation in percentage of the initial concentrations in the prepared syringes) ranged between 80. 53 ± 1. 66 (one of the PUR tubes) and 92. 84 ± 2. 73 (PE/PVC tube). The same parameters measured during diazepam infusion ranged between 48. 58 ± 2. 88 (one of the PUR tubes) and 85. 06 ± 3. 94 (PE/PVC tube). The double-lumen extension tubes in PUR were either thermosetting (resin) or thermoplastic according to reference. Clinicians must be aware of potential drug interactions with extension tube materials and so must consider their nature as well as the sterilisation method used before selecting an infusion device...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} quantify and compare Resultant Muscle Torque (RMT) pattern in quadriceps muscle using elastic resistance training device. Sixteen subjects completed 8 -RM seated knee <b>extension</b> by elastic <b>tubing</b> with original length (E 0) and elastic tubing with 30 % decrement of original length (E 30). Every repetition was partitioned into 6 phases (3 concentric and 3 eccentric) and mean value for external force and acceleration were calculated and synchronized for every phase of lifting. The magnitude of Resultant Muscle Torque was calculated based on the equation recommended by Enoka (2002) for dynamic motions. the RMT values among various exercise types phases demonstrated significantly higher value for E 30 compared with E 0 (all P < 0. 05). This is except in the 3 rd and 4 th phases of contraction which no significant difference observed between E 0 and E 30. Accordingly, the magnitude of increasing RMT in phase 1 (2. 6 %) and phase 6 (3. 98 %) for E 30 compared with E 0 % supported the effectiveness of two applied strategies in developing muscle torque production in ER exercises...|$|R
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short <b>extensions</b> of Teflon <b>tubing</b> are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|R
30|$|The fibrin glue sealant, Baxter Tisseel©, {{was used}} {{due to its}} {{similarity}} to the fibrin product used in 2 previous publications (Franzini et al. 2010, 2013). Our protocol also required fluoroscopically accessing the L 1 — 2 epidural space with an 18 gauge Tuohy needle (using a midline, interlaminar approach). Needle placement was then confirmed with Isovue contrast administration, in both the lateral and anterior-posterior fluoroscopic views. Next, 10  ml of autologous blood was sterilely withdrawn from the patient and briefly set aside after mixing the obtained blood with 3  ml of additional Isovue contrast. The Tisseel© syringe was attached to <b>extension</b> <b>tubing</b> connected to the Tuohy epidural needle hub, and fibrin glue was then injected rapidly into the posterior epidural space until a pressure paresthesia of at least 2 – 3 out of 10 intensity or greater was experienced by the patient. Note that pressure paresthesia was defined as significant pressure sensations felt by the patient in the head, back, buttock or legs (whether unilateral or bilateral). Up to 10  ml of fibrin glue injectate was available to inject (the full capacity of the Tisseel© syringe), although the actual fibrin glue volume utilized was dependent upon the onset and intensity of patient paresthesia response alone (i.e., fibrin glue was injected until the patient experienced this paresthesia response). Thereafter, the previously prepared blood-Isovue mixture was injected immediately afterward through a new connection tube. Only enough blood mixture was injected to clear the epidural needle from fibrin glue (less than 1  cc), while immediately ceasing further injection until the patient’s pressure paresthesia had fully resolved to its pre-procedural baseline. Once the patient’s paresthesia had fully resolved, additional blood-Isovue admixture was injected until the patient again experienced a pressure paresthesia of at least 2 – 3 out of 10 intensity. The epidural needle was then gently flushed with saline or 1  % lidocaine as it was withdrawn from the epidural space and fully removed from the skin. Patients were asked to remain supine in our recovery area for about 30  min post-procedurally to allow further stabilization of the injectate in the epidural space.|$|E
