5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, {{who had lived in}} the top <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from {{depression}} and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|A second death, {{less than}} a week later, forced {{authorities}} to reconsider the cause of Nickell's death. On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work. At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bathroom, unresponsive and with a faint pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988– March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the personality test run by the Church of Scientology, and committed suicide later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Jean gained {{entrance}} into the prestigious Emma Willard School for Girls in New York {{on the recommendation of}} theologian Howard Thurman. Emma Willard would bring its own challenges: Many of the school’s white students resisted her presence, some refusing to even live near her dormitory room. One girl told Jean that Jean’s mother should be washing the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house.|$|R

Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,--an article into which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> establishment.|$|R

25|$|The {{company was}} founded on November 26, 1905 when Florence Butt opened the C.C. Butt Grocery Store on the ground <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family home in Kerrville, Texas. In 1919, Howard Edward Butt, Florence's {{youngest}} son, took over the store upon his return from World War I. Shortly after becoming owner of his mother's small store, Howard tried four expansions into Central Texas, including one in Junction, all of which failed. Finally in 1927, Howard launched a successful second store in Del Rio, Texas followed by the purchase of three grocery stores in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The first initials of Howard E. Butt became {{the name of the}} store.|$|E
50|$|Jeanne Gang, lead {{architect}} of Studio Gang Architects, {{was hired to}} draft ideas for the CentrePointe project in 2011.

He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E

500|$|Ballo {{committed}} suicide, {{hours after}} hearing {{the results of the}} personality test conducted by Scientology.

In April 2008, Aftenposten noted that the French police were investigating connections between Scientology and Ballo's death. The investigation was being headed by a judge in France. In April 2008 the French police interviewed two leaders of Scientology in France. Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier opened an investigation into the incident in France, in April 2008.

[...] Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they could not determine a direct link between the Scientology personality test and Ballo's death.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the effects}} from the {{hurricane}} on Newfoundland occurred on September15 and continued until September18. With winds equivalent {{to that of a}} Category1 hurricane, the cyclone brushed east of the island, bringing extensive flooding. Offshore, a ship estimated winds in excess of [...] off of Grand Bank. Precipitation peaked at a record [...] at Fort Pepperrell. In St. John's, train traffic was effectively halted because of the hurricane. Silt kicked up by the strong winds covered railroad tracks in the southern portions of the city, while heavy rainfall flooded several city streets. Similar problems occurred in Avondale. The nearby Rennie River overflowed its banks, inundating adjacent land. The urban flooding damaged adjacent infrastructure. A three-year-old girl died on September16 after a landslide triggered by the rain filled the first <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> home. This was the only death associated with the hurricane on the island. In Holyrood, the local highway was washed out in areas. A small trestle with two concrete abutments were swept off into the adjacent bay. Another road leading to Cape Saint Francis suffered wash outs as deep as [...] Small bridges were also damaged, and some were washed away. As with the Rennie River, the Waterford River also overflowed its banks due to excessive recharge, and as such inundated 13homes. Another river near Kilbride overflowed, flooding adjacent plots of land and tearing apart pavement. In this manner, several roads were rendered impassable and were cut off to traffic.|$|E

50|$|Told in first-person, {{the protagonist}} recalls {{the deaths of}} his {{grandmother}} ("One day shy of eight years old") and his young wife, and the sadness he felt upon each passing.

50|$|The film covers {{several months}} {{in the life of}} the Nolans, an Irish American family living in the Williamsburg {{neighborhood}} of Brooklyn in 1912. The film is much shorter than the book, which covers the time from before Francie is born until after she turns 16. The film focuses on the time when Francie is around 13 years old.Katie Nolan (Dorothy McGuire) is a hard-working housewife who scrubs the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tenement building and collects rags for sale to a scrap fabric dealer in order to provide for her family. She's married to Johnny Nolan (James Dunn), a happy-go-lucky, charming man who means well but dreams his way through life rather than find steady employment. He is also an alcoholic. On the rare occasions he finds work as a singing waiter, everything he earns usually ends up in his drinking, much to the despair of his disillusioned wife. The couple have two children, 13-year-old Francie (Peggy Ann Garner), who idolizes her father, and 12-year-old Neeley (Cornelius) (Ted Donaldson). Tense and frustrated, Katie is often sharper with the children than she means to be, while Johnny is gentle, generous, and indulgent, especially with Francie.|$|R
