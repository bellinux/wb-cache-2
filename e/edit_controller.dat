50|$|Additionally, {{color grading}} systems require an <b>edit</b> <b>controller.</b> The <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> {{controls}} the telecine and a VTR(s) or other recording/playback devices to ensure frame accurate film frame editing. There {{are a number}} of systems which can be used for edit control. Some color grading products such as Pandora Int.'s Pogle have a built in <b>edit</b> <b>controller.</b> Otherwise, a separate device such as Da Vinci Systems' TLC <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> would be used.|$|E

50|$|The bulk {{of linear}} editing is done simply, with two {{machines}} and an <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> device to control them. Many video tape machines {{are capable of}} controlling a second machine, {{eliminating the need for}} an external editing control device.|$|E
50|$|Some U-Matic VCRs {{could be}} {{controlled}} by external video <b>editing</b> <b>controllers,</b> such as the cuts-only Sony RM-440 for linear video editing systems. Sony and other manufacturers such as Convergence, Calaway, and CMX Systems produced A/B roll systems, which permitted two or more VCRs to be controlled and synchronised for video dissolves and other motion effects, integration of the character generator, audio controllers and digital video effects (DVE).|$|R
5000|$|Strassner Editing Systems (SES) {{was a line}} of PC-based linear [...] "CMX style" [...] {{keyboard}} video <b>editing</b> <b>controllers</b> {{invented in}} 1988 by Norman H. Strassner in Los Angeles, California. Over 400 systems were sold up to the time, in 1995, that Strassner sold the company to a San Jose-based company - Videomedia, Inc., makers of the [...] "V-LAN" [...] hardware he used to physically control video tape machines (VTRs), video and audio switchers and special effects devices.|$|R
50|$|U-matic is {{no longer}} used as a {{mainstream}} television production format, but it has found lasting appeal as a cheap, well specified, and hard-wearing format. The format permitted many broadcast and non-broadcast institutions to produce television programming on an accessible budget, spawning programming distribution, classroom playback, etc. At its peak popularity, U-matic recording and playback equipment was manufactured by Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Sharp, with many spin-off product manufacturers, such as video <b>edit</b> <b>controllers,</b> time base correctors, video production furniture, playback monitors and carts, etc.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Robert Bosch GmbH {{introduced}} the Mach One list-management <b>edit</b> <b>controller,</b> a lower-cost (and less powerful) post-production alternative to CMX edit controllers. At the time, both CMX and Bosch edit controllers utilized similar DEC computers as their basic hardware.|$|E
50|$|Though both {{of these}} {{developments}} helped greatly, effectively creating the offline editing method, they didn't {{solve the problem of}} precisely controlling the video recorder for frame accurate editing. That required precise control of the tape transport mechanism, using a dedicated <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> that could read the time code and perform an edit exactly on cue.|$|E
50|$|In video recording, video {{segments}} {{and programs}} are similarly cued by turning {{one or more}} knobs back and forth, on the panel of a recording deck or <b>edit</b> <b>controller,</b> until the desired points are located and set. Analog video on tape is also largely obsolete, although some digital interfaces continue to use cueing knobs, or their virtual equivalents.|$|E
50|$|Video editing {{reached its}} full {{potential}} in the late 1970s when computer-controlled minicomputer <b>edit</b> <b>controllers</b> along with communications protocols were developed, which could orchestrate an edit based on an EDL, using timecode to synchronize multiple tape machines and auxiliary devices using a 9-Pin Protocol. The most popular and widely used computer edit systems came from Sony, Ampex and the venerable CMX. Systems such as these were expensive, especially when considering auxiliary equipment like VTR, video switchers and character generators (CG) and were usually limited to high-end post-production facilities.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, CTL {{timecode}} is {{an absolute}} timecode with specific digital references for every frame of video. Thus, a tape with CTL timecode can always display current timecode position accurately, even if the tape is moved from one machine to another. CTL timecode embedding can be transferred when making a copy, {{as long as the}} recording machine supports CTL timecode. Because CTL timecode is SMPTE timecode, its timecode can be interchanged with other SMPTE timecode schemes, like VITC and LTC (linear, audio track) timecode, as well as SMPTE timecode devices like timecode readers, generators, window dub inserters, MIDI synchronizers, and <b>edit</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term online {{originated}} in the telecommunication industry, meaning [...] "Under the direct control of another device" [...] (automation). Online editors such as the Sony BVE-9000 edit control unit used the RS-422 remote control 9-Pin Protocol to allow the computer-interface of <b>edit</b> <b>controllers</b> to control video tape recorders (VTR) via a series of commands. The protocol supports a variety of devices including one-inch reel-to-reel type C videotape as well as videocassette recorders (VCR) to Fast-Forward, Rewind and Play and Record based on SMPTE timecode. The controllers {{have the ability to}} interface with professional audio equipment like audio mixers with console automation.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, CMX, a {{collaborative}} between CBS and Memorex, introduced the first computer-based <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> using SMPTE time code for editing. The CMX 200 could control both the source (A-roll) and record (B-Roll) quad VTRs. CMX {{continued to make}} more powerful edit controllers capable of controlling more VTRs and peripheral devices, such as switchers, DVEs and character generators.|$|E
50|$|The Spectra Ace was {{introduced}} to the market in 1986, and won the company an Emmy Award. The proprietary system for off-line editing incorporates an <b>edit</b> <b>controller,</b> a video switcher, single and dual-headed laser disc players, video monitors, videotape recorders, terminal equipment and associated software. It operated Laser Edit, Inc. as a marketing arm. Laser Edit became a post production house over time.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 EECO {{created and}} {{introduced}} the EECO-900 <b>edit</b> <b>controller,</b> which used their proprietary On-Time time code (the later and more standard SMPTE time code {{had not yet}} been developed), which was used in conjunction with the quad machines of the time, and was the successor to Ampex's Editec. The EECO-900 and On-Time timecode were developed from EECO's previous work and products developed for NASA for logging and timecoding of their telemetry tapes during space missions.|$|E
5000|$|PX-5S (2013) - A stage ready {{variation}} of the PX-350, the PX-5S adds tone <b>editing</b> and <b>controller</b> capabilities and a new Ivory Touch keybed. The internal speakers and accompaniment were removed to a facilitate the new features. The PX-5S weighs under 25 lbs., holding {{the distinction of being}} the lightest stage piano ever manufactured.|$|R
50|$|The Steenbeck {{company was}} founded in 1931 by Wilhelm Steenbeck in Hamburg, Germany. Since then, the name Steenbeck has become widely known in the film editing {{community}} and more than 25,000 machines are in operation around the world. The company relocated to Venray (The Netherlands) in September 2003, where it still manufactures editing tables.Despite the move away from physical film stock - much editing is now based on digital media - devices such as the Lightworks non-linear film <b>editing</b> <b>controller</b> and archives still use the Steenbeck physical layout for controlling the process. The Steenbeck's lower light levels and controllable speed make it a preferred piece of equipment for film archives (such as the Library of Congress' motion picture collection) and restoration facilities as prints can be quickly and easily inspected with less risk of damage compared to a movie projector. Because there is no intermittent movement, the image is created through a rotating prism which scans the frames. Steenbeck machines {{were known to be}} exceptionally easy on film stock, due to their use of soft-edged nylon rollers.|$|R
5000|$|The Sony PCM-1600 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} video-based 16-bit recorder. The 1600 (and its later versions, the 1610 and 1630) used special U-matic-format (aka [...] "3/4"" [...] or [...] "three-quarter") VCRs also furnished by Sony for transports, such as the BVU-800DA, VO-5630DA, and the later DMR-2000 and DMR-4000, which were based from the industrial VO-5850 and the broadcast BVU-800 video machines respectively. These were all in essence modified versions of existing Sony U-Matic video recorders adapted for use with the 1600-series adaptors by way of disabling the chroma and dropout compensation (DOC) circuits of the VCRs, which would hinder the proper recording of the monochrome-video-based digital audio data from the 1600-series adaptors if enabled. Editing was accomplished by using a 1600-series adaptor and 2 {{or more of these}} VCRs with a DAE-3000 <b>editing</b> <b>controller.</b> The 1600-series were the first systems used for mastering audio compact discs in the early 1980s by many major record labels, with the final U-matic 1600-format digital audio tapes being sent to CD pressing plants to be recorded to a glass master disc used for making the replicated CDs.|$|R
50|$|The TLC was an <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> for telecines and VTRs. It {{provided}} accurate 2/3 editing. TLC 1 {{was originally}} made in Moorpark, California, later TLC {{was acquired by}} da Vinci and the TLC 2 was released. The da Vinci DUI 888 had an option to have a built-in TLC built. If the TLC is not built in, an external A/B switch box is needed to switch control between the TLC and other Color Controllers. Some versions had a separate CPU and Telecine interface rack.|$|E
5000|$|The Quadriga [...] {{system was}} {{developed}} by the BBC in 1988 using 4 synchronised D1 recorders, 54 MHz sampling, and distributed the signal {{in such a way that}} blocks of 4 pixels were sent to each recorder in turn. Thus if a single tape was viewed, the image would appear as a fair but distorted representation of the whole image, enabling edit decisions to be taken on a single recording, and a three-machine edit was possible on a single quadriga by processing each of the four channels in turn, with identical edits made on the other three channels subsequently under the control of a programmed <b>edit</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1992 - In a {{significant}} development {{in addition to}} vector grading, Custom Curves {{were introduced to the}} Renaissance 888. 1994 - da Vinci Systems wholly acquired the TLC product line from Time Logic. The TLC is still viewed today as the de facto standard edit control interface between telecines, color correctors, VTRs and DDRs. TLC (Time Logic Controller) is an <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> for telecines, vision mixers (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). The TLC 2 was released later that year under the da Vinci brand.|$|E
40|$|The use of indium beams {{in place}} of lead beams for the CERN heavy ion program was studied. It {{was found that the}} Indium beam {{emittance}} was measured downstream of the spectrometer by a quadrupole sean.

5000|$|According to some reviews, the F for Fake mash-up has {{possibly}} {{paved the}} way for the modern [...] "attention-deficit" [...] style of editing. More likely, Welles was influenced by those that came before, such as the French New Wave and Dadaist filmmakers such as Jean Luc Godard and René Clair who used editing to alternately build and deconstruct. What is unique to the film is the concept of the unreliable narrator. A key subject of the film itself, which at many points shows Welles sitting at an <b>editing</b> <b>controller,</b> as he narrates and draws self-reflexive attention to the problems with veracity in life and filmmaking. Several filmmakers contributed to the forgery that is [...] "F for Fake" [...] including B-movie cinematographer Gary Graver (who contributes all footage filmed in the U.S., as well as some very choppy editing, and his own voice/image as the dubious on-screen [...] "newscaster") as well as Welles' girlfriend and muse, Oja Kodar (who at one point appears in a series of butt shots as she is ogled both by Welles' camera and by stock footage of males who [...] "see" [...] her). It is in fact a trick of editing and/or creative geography and Welles' first lie in the film, or is it? Who directed these shots? Kodar claims she did. It is unclear where Welles' participation stops and his lesser-known collaborators begins, as the film employs multiple editors, multiple directors, multiple cross cuttings of unrelated footage and the often erratic use of creative geography as well as multiple voice overs. An example of this appears with a series of near wordless shots of Irving and de Hory seemingly in debate as to whether de Hory ever signed his forgeries (the shots of Irving and de Hory were in fact taken at different times).|$|R
50|$|Many newer {{chipsets}} {{support the}} Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), which allows operating systems to universally control them and enable NCQ. Newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively, and FreeBSD fully supports AHCI since version 8.0. Windows Vista and Windows 7 also natively support AHCI, but their AHCI support (via the msahci service) must be manually enabled via registry <b>editing</b> if <b>controller</b> support {{was not present}} during their initial install. Windows 7's AHCI enables not only NCQ but also TRIM support on SSD drives (with their supporting firmware). Older operating systems such as Windows XP require the installation of a vendor-specific driver (similar to installing a RAID or SCSI controller) even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter, which makes initial setup more tedious and conversions of existing installations relatively difficult as most controllers cannot operate their ports in mixed AHCI-SATA/IDE/legacy mode.|$|R
5000|$|Internally, the Foundation 2000 {{hardware}} {{is controlled}} by a Motorola 68030 CPU with a Motorola 68000 inside the <b>Edit</b> <b>Controller</b> to handle the touch-screen display and buttons. In addition to two Motorola 56002 DSPs, each a 40 MHz DSP that operates natively on 24-bit data, on the main CPU boards, the unit could be expanded by adding up to six [...] "Algorithmic Computing Engine" [...] Mix Processors boards, each containing four additional Motorola 56002 DSP processor. A fully loaded Foundation 2000 contains 26 of these programmable processors, however {{it is unclear what}} benefits are gained since the last revision of the software appears to only use them to for signal routing, stereo panning and three-band eq for the machine's 8 audio tracks.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, 3M {{introduced}} the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits {{could not be}} accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital [...] "word". Unfortunately, the only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit [...] "word" [...] for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50 kHz). It {{was known to be}} the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video.|$|E
50|$|Until 1993, the Avid Media Composer {{was most}} often used for editing {{commercials}} or other small content/high value projects. This was primarily because the purchase cost of the system was very high, especially {{in comparison to the}} offline tape-based systems that were then in general use. Hard disk storage was also expensive enough to be a limiting factor on the quality of footage that most editors could work with and/or the amount of material that could be held digitised at any one time. In editing facilities rented by the hour or the day, a production's digitised rushes would usually be deleted {{at the end of the}} hire, so that the full amount of hard disk storage was available to the next client. Nonetheless, as all editing was being done at an offline video quality, it was possible to edit broadcast documentaries on as little as 3 gigabytes of hard drive storage. The end product of the offline non-linear editing process was a frame-accurate Edit Decision List ('EDL') that was output to a floppy disk and taken, together with the source tapes (aka 'the rushes'), to an online quality tape editing suite. The EDL was then read into an <b>edit</b> <b>controller</b> and used to 'auto-conform' a replica of the offline edit, playing portions of the source tapes back at full video quality and recording them to a master tape as per the exact edit points of the EDL.|$|E
40|$|A Web-based IDE {{that allows}} users to easily manage Model and Controller {{components}} of a CakePHP web application was developed. With this IDE, users are able to manage the model and controller components without having to write very much PHP code. They are able to create new model components without {{having to worry about}} creating the database tables for the models as the IDE creates them automatically. The IDE offers a simple interface for users to edit the schema of their models. Users can add or delete data from their models without dealing with the SQL insert/delete statements. The IDE also supports adding new controllers to their projects and adding models to be used by the controllers. Constructing find methods (equivalent to SQL statements) is easy because the IDE provides users with a simple interface. Users do not need to deal with the complex SQL select queries. Users can associate the models by using a simple form. The IDE also provides a code-completion feature for users when they <b>edit</b> the <b>controller</b> files. If users want to run their applications on other machines, then they can simply export their applications to a SQL file that they can run on other machines. Finally, the IDE also provides small interactive tutorials on each feature when the users use those features...|$|R
50|$|Sequencer. Ensoniq's {{approach}} for sequencing was somewhat {{different from other}} manufacturers. Instead of offering a linear set of tracks for recording, the TS required the user to record short sequences (12 tracks each) {{to use as a}} base for song structure, then chaining them and optionally layering another 12 linear tracks on top of the chained blocks. The sequencer editing options included quantization with audition, <b>controller</b> <b>editing</b> and scaling and MIDI functions per track, as well as copying whole or parts of tracks to anywhere else. The keyboard could store up to 30 songs with 100 sequences per song, memory-permitting, and everything was kept in memory when the synth was turned off. Modern synthesizers, with larger and better sequencers, demand the user to save their work before power down, since the sequencer memory is not backed up.|$|R
