5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation <b>from</b> <b>when</b> reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely}} to leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
