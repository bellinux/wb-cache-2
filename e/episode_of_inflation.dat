" In a detailed examination of Feldstein's Effective Tax Rate model and a less extensive review of his other formulations (Neoclassical and Return-Over-Cost models), a number of important and independent criticisms are advanced. Our results from examining all three models suggest strongly that taxes have not adversely affected capital formation during the recent <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> a conclusion consistent with the relatively robust levels of net investment between 1965 and 1981 actually shown in the newly benchmarked National Income data. ...|$|E
40|$|Balassa and Samuelson {{showed that}} as we move towards richer {{countries}} the measured price level becomes higher. Their proposed explanation was {{to appeal to the}} presence of a service element in most goods. In this thesis, I begin by introducing an exploring of an alternative candidate explanation for the B-S relationship. This explanation is based on an appeal to mismeasured quality. In the model developed in Chapter 2, the well-known difﬁculties surrounding the problem of making a full and appropriate adjustment for differing quality levels will mean that when the average quality level consumed is higher in richer countries, this will showup in the data as spurious difference in price levels, which will imply the B-S relationship. More interestingly, it also leads to a second testable prediction that is not a prediction of the classic B-S explanation. This second prediction is tested directly at the end of Chapter 2. In testing this prediction, we are led naturally to explore the foundation of the B-S relationship at a disaggregate level. In Chapter 3, we take a purely statistical approach in asking the question: what is the best statistical description of wealth versus price level relationship for individual products? We arrive at a characterization of the best statistical description which suggests a natural way of ordering products relative to the form of this relationship. A striking pattern emerges, according to which products at the one end of the spectrum are almost all manufactured goods (designated the ‘M-group’), while products {{at the other end of}} the spectrum are almost all pure services (designated the ‘S-group’). In Chapter 4 and 5, we return to theory. We propose a separate model for the S-group in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 we return to the analysis of Chapter 2, but now we apply the analysis to the M-group only. Chapter 6 is devoted to exploring the macroeconomic implications of the B-S relationship.

40|$|Between January 2011 and April 2012, Santorini volcano (Greece) {{experienced}} {{a period of}} unrest characterised by the onset of detectable seismicity and caldera-wide uplift. This <b>episode</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> represented the first sizeable intrusion of magma beneath Santorini in the past 50 years. We employ a new approach using 222 Rn– δ 13 C systematics to identify and quantify the source of diffuse degassing at Santorini {{during the period of}} renewed activity. Soil CO 2 flux measurements were made across a network of sites on Nea Kameni between September 2010 and January 2012. Gas samples were collected in April and September 2011 for isotopic analysis of CO 2 (δ 13 C), and radon detectors were deployed during September 2011 to measure (222 Rn). Our results reveal a change in the pattern of degassing from the summit of the volcano (Nea Kameni) and suggest an increase in diffuse CO 2 emissions between September 2010 and January 2012. High-CO 2 -flux soil gas samples have δ 13 C ∼ 0. Using this value and other evidence from the literature we conclude that these CO 2 emissions from Santorini were a mixture between CO 2 sourced from magma, and CO 2 released by the thermal or metamorphic breakdown of crustal limestone. We suggest that this mixing of magmatic and crustal carbonate sources may account more broadly for the typical range of δ 13 CvaluesofCO 2 (from ∼− 4 to ∼+ 1) in diffuse volcanic and fumarole gas emissions around the Mediterranean, without the need to invoke unusual mantle source compositions. At Santorini a mixing model involving magmatic CO 2 (with δ 13 C of − 3 ± 2 and elevated (222 Rn) /CO 2 ratios ∼ 10 5 – 10 6 Bqkg − 1) andCO 2 released from decarbonation of crustal limestone (with (222 Rn) /CO 2 ∼ 30 – 300 Bqkg − 1,and δ 13 Cof + 5) can account for the δ 13 C and (222 Rn) /CO 2 characteristics of the ‘high flux’ gas source. This model suggests ∼ 60 % of the carbon in the high flux deep CO 2 end member is of magmatic origin. This combination of δ 13 Cand(222 Rn) measurements has potential to quantify magmatic and crustal contributions to the diffuse outgassing of CO 2 in volcanic areas, especially those where breakdown of crustal limestone is likely to contribute significantly to the CO 2 flu...|$|E

This is despite the Bank of Botswana’s (BOB) concerted effort to keep inflation at its minimum and stable over time. More specifically, it has been attempting to bring down and keep inflation within the medium-term objective range of 3 to 6 percent. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to: (a) examine the determinants <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in Botswana by identifying the factors that have influenced its movements over time; and (b) assess {{the likelihood that the}} Bank of Botswana’s medium-term objective range of 3 to 6 percent could be achieved in the short to medium-term (one and half to two years). To examine these objectives, the study used an Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) estimation technique. A quarterly data ranging from the first quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 2010 is used to estimate the model. And the results show that the identified variables are significant and have the theoretically expected signs. The main conclusions of the study are: (a) price inertia, real GDP, money supply and South African prices play a dominant role in determining inflation in Botswana; and (b) unless international deflationary environment prevails, the probability that the Bank of Botswana will achieve its medium-term objective range of 3 to 6 percent in the medium-term is very low, according to the policy simulation results in this study...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} arguments in favour of price stability is that unexpected inflation generates changes in the distribution of income and wealth among different economic agents.

A key finding is that the redistributional effects <b>of</b> unexpected <b>inflation</b> are large even with <b>episodes</b> <b>of</b> low <b>inflation.</b> The main winners are young, middle-income households who are major holders of fixed-rate mortgage debt and the government [...] inflation reduces the real burden of their debt.

40|$|Campi Flegrei caldera, {{within the}} Neapolitan area of Italy, is {{potentially}} {{one of the}} most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and during the last decade it has shown clear signs of reactivation, marked by the onset of uplift and changes in the geochemistry of gas emissions. We describe a 30 -year-long data set of the CO 2 –He–Ar–N 2 compositions of fumarolic emissions from La Solfatara crater, which is located in the center of the caldera. The data display continuous decreases in both the N 2 /He and N 2 /CO 2 ratios since 1985, paralleled by an increase in He/CO 2. These variations cannot be explained by either processes of boiling/condensation in the local hydrothermal system or with changes in the mixing proportions between a magmatic vapor and hydrothermal fluids. We applied the magma degassing model of Nuccio and Paonita (2001, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 193, 467 – 481) using the most recent inert-gas solubilities in order to interpret these peculiar features in accordance with petrologic constraints derived from the ranges of the melt compositions and reservoir pressures at Campi Flegrei. The model simulations for mafic melts (trachybasalt and shoshonite) show a remarkably good agreement with the measured data. Both decompressive degassing of an ascending magma and mixing between magmatic fluids exsolved at various levels along the ascent path can explain the long-term geochemical changes.
