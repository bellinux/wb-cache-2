5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get <b>different</b> <b>colors.</b> The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of <b>different</b> <b>colors).</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of <b>different</b> <b>colors,</b> particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and gates of some houses.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have <b>different</b> <b>colors.</b> If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
5|$|The Front Mission {{series has}} spawned a number of action figures and model kits. In 1997, {{with the release of}} Front Mission 2, Kotobukiya {{released}} three resin kits depicting certain wanzers (mecha) from the game, such as the Zenith V. In 1999, Kotobukiya's ARTFX team produced a line of six-inch action figures depicting wanzers seen in Front Mission 3 such as the Zenith RV. Toy distributor Palisades released these figures In North America in 2000, and they were later reissued in <b>different</b> <b>colors.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in <b>different</b> <b>colors).</b> Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, first {{introduced}} with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.|$|E
5|$|The author noted wryly {{that later}} in the series Allen's hair became similar to a Super Saiyan, a {{transformation}} in the Dragon Ball series where the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in D.Gray-mans publication, Allen {{was one of the}} hardest characters to draw. By the tenth volume, she said that the character was more difficult to draw than Yu Kanda. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> (such as red and light blue) due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E

Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is {{in the center of}} the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with <b>different</b> <b>colors.</b> The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the light blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became gray and blue.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the design}} and {{significance}} of maritime flags flying on ships in Tunis are unknown. However, various sources {{have been able to}} distinguish certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape {{in the presence of the}} colors blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, red and green stripes, identifying the Ottoman regency in Tunis. This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> and arrangements were also used on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Skåne was a Danish {{province}} without heraldic arms {{before its}} transfer to Sweden in 1658, and its arms, granted in 1660, {{are based on}} the city of Malmö's Danish era arms. The Malmö arms were granted in 1437 during the Kalmar Union by Eric of Pomerania and contains a Pomeranian griffin. The Skåne coat of arms was created for the funeral of Charles X Gustav of Sweden in 1660, and it is typically represented with a ducal coronet. The coat of arms for the new Skåne County, formed in 1997, was based on the arms of Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County, which in turn were based on the province arms (both former counties were divided from the old Skåne province); the Skåne County arms are the province arms with <b>different</b> <b>colors.</b> When the county arms is shown crowned with a Swedish royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of royal government authority.

5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of <b>different</b> <b>colors</b> (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
