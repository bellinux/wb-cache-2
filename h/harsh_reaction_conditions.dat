Dr. Louie’s research aims to mediate these transitions via metal catalyzed reactions, mainly involving nickel catalysis. Dr. Louie and her team focuses on nickel-based systems not only because it is much less expensive than the more widely used palladium and platinum, but also because it offers a wider range of chemical activity, such as nickel, being a more electropositive transition metal which allows it to undergo oxidative addition readily; oxidize Nickel and lessens the electron density around the atom itself.6 This allows for the cross-coupling of electrophiles to occur which is pivotal in the formation of carbocycles and heterocycles. Dr. Loui and her colleagues further enhance the catalytic ability by combining nickel   with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands.   The NHC ligands are largely sterically hindered and electron donating, which allows improved and less <b>harsh</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>conditions</b> by expanding the chemical scope of the substrate.

Interconversion is shown to be catalysed by both Lewis (e. g. iron chloride) and Bronsted (e. g. trifluoromethanesulphonic) acids in a polar aprotic solvent (e. g. nitromethane). The balance between interconversion and polymerisation can be controlled by temperature~ndcatalyst acidity. Hydrochloric and nitric acid catalysts favour polymerisation, where interconversion conditions were found for trifluoromethanesulphonic and methanesulphonic acids.

The type of transformation that occurs depends {{on the nature of}} the intermediate that can be accessed which in turn is controlled by the nature of starting material, <b>reaction</b> <b>conditions</b> and catalyst. This thesis describes studies into exploring completely new intermediates in nucleophilic catalysis or exploiting established intermediates in new ways. The first chapter provides an overview of the reactivity patterns that can be seen in this field of catalysis, with transformations categorised by the key reactive intermediate. The acyl azolium, α,β- unsaturated acyl azolium, acyl azolium enolate, β-azolium enolate and hemiacetal azolium are all discussed. Chapter two describes studies towards the use of the novel α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated acyl azolium intermediate in reaction discovery, in this context in an all carbon formal (4 + 2) cycloaddition reaction. The development of this reaction is discussed and limitations in this methodology described and addressed. Chapter three describes the use of enol esters in an attempt to access similar intermediates. Through the use of <b>harsher</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>conditions,</b> novel bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane materials were synthesised. The generality of the reaction was explored and mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction proceeded via a hemiacetal azolium intermediate, through at [1, 5] shift mechanism to access an unstable unconjugated intermediate before thermal (4 + 2) cycloaddition. The reactivity of the products was further investigated and a brief study into an enantioselective variant of the reaction was also undertaken. Chapter four describes the investigation into utilizing NHCs as nucleophilic catalysts in intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reactions where the diene and dienophile are tethered by an ester. This synthetically challenging transformation arises due to the conformational resting state of the molecule and studies on using nucleophilic catalysis to address this are described in this chapter.

The MC tests yielded conflicting results with some tests having stable catalysts and the majority have unstable catalysts due to poor wash-coat adhesion. The unsuccessful cases were due to a loss of catalyst. The change in catalyst stability was postulated {{to be the result of}} the wash-coating suspension size being reduced too much. In the cases where catalyst instability due to poor adhesion and ultimately loss of the catalyst the suspension batch size was reduced such that the surface tension of the viscous suspension now exceeded the intermolecular forces in the liquid. This resulted bubble formation and due to the high viscosity of the suspension due to the presence of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder the bubbles remained during the wash-coating process which is thought to have adversely affected the wash-coats adhesion. Another possible cause which is thought to have amplified the poor adhesion of the unstable catalyst runs is the thermal expansion of the stainless-steel reactor plates. The results of this study could not give outright and straightforward conclusions as to why there were 2 stable runs and unstable runs due to a loss of catalyst. As a result, further work is required to confirm the postulations and trends seen in this study. Future work should concentrate on using a larger batch of suspension to mitigate bubble formation, adding an alumina primer layer before wash-coating the catalyst to aid adhesion through additional oxide bond formation and the use of a more thermally stable stainless steel reactor plate to mitigate thermal expansion...|$|R

A range of N-substituted maleimide cycloadducts have been prepared and asymmetric transformations undertaken to give N-acyliminium ion precursors. N-Acyliminium ions have been formed under standard conditions and a range of nucleophiles used to form tertiary and quaternary stereocentres. For the synthesis of polycyclic heterocycles, a N-[2 -(6 -methoxypyridin- 2 -yl) ethyl] cycloadduct was prepared in 3 steps from commercially available starting materials. Asymmetric transformations were carried out; reduction and Grignard addition to form hydroxy-lactams both in high yield with high selectivity. The N-acyliminium ion was then formed for both systems but unfortunately, due to the inherent electron poor nature of the pyridine ring, even with an activating methoxy group, no ring formation occurred and side products predominated. For the synthesis of natural product comosidine, a N-(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylpropyl) maleimide cycloadduct was prepared in high yield and a range of nucleophiles added to prepare hydroxy-lactam analogues. When subjected to Friedel-Crafts conditions in an attempt to form a 7 membered ring, no cyclisation took place. In fact, intramolecular Friedel-Crafts additions were shown to be highly dependent on the ring size that is being formed when using a dimethoxyphenyl group as nucleophile. Indeed the 6 membered ring is the only size that will form. Attempts to make 5, 7 and 8 membered rings by this method are not viable, and computational studies show the desired FriedelCrafts products are relatively less stable than the alkenes that are indeed formed experimentally for the 7 and 8 ring analogues. Intermolecular Friedel-Crafts reactions have also been undertaken using nucleophiles such as furan, thiophene and indole, accessing tertiary stereocentres (seven examples in 54 - 100 % yield) and quaternary stereo centres (five examples in 50 - 100 % yield). Retro Diels-Alder reaction of furan addition cycloadduct containing a quaternary stereocentre yielded a substituted maleimide derivative in 100 % yield and 97 % enantiomeric excess. This {{demonstrates the}} use of this strategy to construct quaternary stereo genic centres. A further attempt to prepare comosidine used a Parham cyclisation; using an aryl iodide to form the desired 7 membered ring. This proved to be very successful and gave the corresponding hydroxy-lactam in high yield. Addition of carbon nucleophiles such as silyl enol ethers, were then tested on a range of substituted N-acyliminium ions to prove the overall methodology before application to the natural product. Three examples with tertiary stereocentres were prepared in 97 - 98 % yield and four examples with quaternary stereocentres formed in 78 - 95 % yield, exclusively. The nature of the Nacyliminium ion itself has found to be very important. If the iminium ion is unstabilised, nucleophilic addition is relatively facile. However, if a stabilising group is attached such as a phenyl ring, attack is much more difficult and <b>harsher</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>conditions</b> are needed. The N-acyliminium ion formed for comosidine was found to be very stable and therefore would not react with any nucleophile tested. Several ideas to overcome the stability and unreactivity of very electron rich N-acyliminium ions have been investigated. Finally, the formal synthesis of (+) -hygrine has been completed by use of the methodology; using addition of acetone to the N-acyliminium ion formed from Nmethylmaleimide hydroxy-lactam in 100 % yield. Other steps including cycloreversion, hydrogenation and amide reduction gave the enantioenriched protected natural product in 7 steps from 9 -(1 -methoxyethyl) anthracene auxiliary and N-methyl maleimide.

Ionic liquids, low melting salts, are an unusual class of compounds which offer a large potential for technological advancements in many sectors. Examples are found in energy storage, biopolymer valorization and product separations. Ionic liquids are excellent solvents for cellulose and have been known to catalyze a whole range of reactions. Therefore, the focus in this work is on the physicochemical and catalytic effect of ionic liquids on different polymers. In the first part, thedehydrochlorination of chlorinated polymers such as poly(vinyl chloride) is explored. The end-of-life treatment of PVC is complicated by its large chlorine content. Different phosphonium ionic liquids dissolve PVC and catalyze the dehydrochlorination reaction, the removal of HCl from the polymer chain. Dissolution facilitates the reaction due to the better contact between the polymer and the catalyst. Ionic liquids containing anions with a high hydrogen-bond basicity are the best catalysts for the reaction. In tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, [P 4444][Cl], this results in a dehydrochlorination degree of 98  %. Stabilized PVC is dehydrochlorinated more slowely, but still a high conversion of over 96  % is reached. Chemical recycling of dehydrochlorinated polymers can be achieved via reverse acyclic diene metathesis, allowing the design of a process with a high carbon efficiency, producing valuable chemicals fromwaste. In the second part, the remarkable interaction between cellulose and ionic liquids is studied. Cellulose is known to dissolve in a range of ionic liquids. Dissolution occurs through breaking of the extensive hydrogen bond network, generating less crystalline cellulose. Reduction in crystallinity is an essential step in cellulose valorization. Regeneration of dissolved cellulose however requires the addition of an anti-solvent, such as water, which afterwards has to be removed from the ionic liquid. As this removal is very energy-intensive, an alternative treatment is proposed in this work: cellulose amorphization can also be achieved via soaking in ionic liquid/water mixtures. The optimal water concentration in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate, [EMIM][CH 3 COO], is 20 wt %. At this concentration the reduction in crystallinity is maximized and the loss of cellulose due to dissolution is minimized. Furthermore, the addition of water to the ionic liquid significantly decreases the viscosity of the mixture. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used as a structure-sensitive technique to monitor the changes in crystallinity in situ, confirming the results of thebatch experiments. Soaking of cellulose in ionic liquid/water mixtures provides a single step method to obtain less crystalline cellulose, available for further enzymatic or chemical processing. In the last part,the dissolution and valorization of lignin, one of the three major biomass constituents, is studied. The different ether and C-C linkages between the aromatic building blocks of this polymer complicate the design ofdepolymerization methods. Dissolution is a first step in the valorization of lignin. Ionic liquids are prime candidates for lignin dissolution. Their low volatility and flammability allow the design of safer and cleaner chemical processes. In this work, we explored lignin dissolution innon-imidazolium ionic liquids, which are more stable in <b>harsher</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>conditions.</b> N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide, [BMPyr][N(CN) 2], combines a high lignin dissolution capacity and a low viscosity with a very low cellulose dissolution capacity, allowing separation of the biomass fractions prior to lignin valorization. Valorization of lignincan be achieved via mild oxidative and acidic depolymerization. Bismuth-promoted platinum on acidic carbon was tested as a catalyst system on different lignin model compounds. The selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols allows the acidic cleavage of the typical β-O-aryl etherbond in lignin. During this process, phenol groups are retained, allowing the production of functionalized aromatics from lignin. status: publishe...|$|R
