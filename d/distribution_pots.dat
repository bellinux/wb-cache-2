40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleMarine spatial {{planning}} (MSP) is increasingly promoted {{as part of}} an ecosystem-based approach to marine resource management. Impacts of MSP may be particularly great in inshore fisheries, yet despite their vulnerability, assessing potential impacts of spatial measures on inshore fisheries is limited by data scarcity, and the comparability of patterns of fishing activity produced by different data sources is poorly understood. This study contributes to the debate around information needs for MSP by describing the <b>distribution</b> of lobster <b>potting</b> activity at four ports in Northumberland, UK, using two sources of spatial data: observed fishing vessel sightings by patrol vessels and perceived fishing activity elicited through interviews with local fishers. The comparability of the <b>distributions</b> of <b>potting</b> activity mapped by the two datasets was explored using Mantel tests and overlap of fishing hotspots identified. Fishing activity at all ports tended towards an aggregated or patchy distribution, with hotspots located in inshore areas in close proximity to vessels[U+ 05 F 3] home ports. The two datasets were correlated at each port, though the strength of correlation varied among ports, being greater in ports with more highly aggregated fishing activity. Results suggest that vessel sightings are likely to better represent variable intensity of fishing activity, while interview data may more accurately capture the absolute extent of grounds important to fishers. This study highlights some of the merits and limitations of two available data sources currently used to inform fisheries management and marine conservation planning, and outlines an approach to assessing the consistency of datasets in describing the spatial distribution of activity. Given the limitations of individual datasets, we recommend triangulation of available data to inform MSP, alongside qualitative data on fishers' behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Flood {{frequency}} analysis (FFA) concerns prediction {{of the magnitude}} and corresponding frequency of extreme flood events. Extreme floods can {{be the result of}} various hydrological processes. In Norway, rainfall and snowmelt are considered to be the two main flood generating processes. The use of mixture models, to account for these different flood generating processes, are investigated for catchments in Norway. For the case of annual maximum series (AMS), a two-component mixture of Gumbel distributions is fitted, by assuming that the mixture weights are both known and unknown. Subsequently, for peaks over threshold (POT) series a two-component mixture of exponential distributions is considered. Again, the two cases of known and unknown mixture weights are studied. When assuming that the mixture weights are known, these are given by the precalculated proportion of rainfall and snowmelt contributing to each flood value. The mixture models are compared to the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and the Gumbel distribution for AMS, and to the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution and the exponential <b>distribution</b> for <b>POT.</b> Maximum likehood is used for parameter estimation, and for the mixture models with unknown weights the maximum likehood estimates are obtained by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The predictive performance of the models are compared using various scoring rules. In addition, the stability of the models are compared. We found that although the scoring rules are not always able to differentiate between the models, the Gumbel distribution and the exponential distribution, for the case of AMS and POT respectively, often give the most reliable and stable estimates. The mixture models estimated by the EM algorithm occasionally give unexpected results and seems unfit for practical use in FFA...|$|R
40|$|In a 2000 {{issue of}} the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, I {{proposed}} to view pottery traditions as technical aggregates whose various components {{had the ability to}} inform about different facets of social identity. Fashioning techniques were said to reflect deeper parts of identity -such as language or socio-professional affiliation-, while decorating techniques and motives were associated with more superficial and situational facets of identity. Although allowing making sense of the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>potting</b> techniques observed at various scales across the African continent, the model poses several problems. In particular, its explanatory framework centres on the intrinsic properties of technical actions (low vs. high visibility on finished product; specialized vs. unspecialized gestures) at the expanse of the social context of activity. In terms of cultural dynamics, it also highlights transmission upon practice. Exploiting data collected in Southern Niger between 2002 and 2010, and relying on the concepts of situated learning and communities of practice, I will show that a different explanation may be offered. In deep analysis of potters’ behaviour and changing relations within their social world of activity shows indeed that individuals are fully aware of the relationships between “doing” and “being”, and act upon their technical repertoire accordingly. As the meaning given to technical action arise both from the early modalities of learning and the social trajectory of practitioners, techniques may be reproduced, transformed, or replaced, irrespectively of their intrinsic qualities. Potters, in other words, shape the destiny of their own traditions, and, through it, their own destiny. Such perspective does not only provide a more satisfying way of explaining the relationship between social identity and technical actions. It also compels us {{to pay more attention to}} the content and dynamics of technical repertoires at every step of the manufacturing process. Key elements in that regard are the interconnectedness of the environmental and social milieus, as well as the geography of individual contacts. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

Two other tests, the "Bubble Test" and a tortuosity representation, were also found to be accurate quality control measures. In the production of CPFs, {{it was found that the}} percentage of combustible by mass, in this case rice husk, is the primary factor in determining both the flow rate characteristics and strength characteristics of the CPF.

It quantifies the attributes of wares, forms, and decorations among the site 2 ̆ 7 s ceramics and evaluates the degree of variation within the site. Examining the spatial <b>distribution</b> of different <b>potting</b> traditions within the site demonstrates the Cherokee women who made the pottery there came from different cultural backgrounds and practiced different potting traditions. Comparing the 40 GN 9 data to other protohistoric-period sites in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina then illuminates possible connections between the ceramic traditions practiced at the site and others visible in the region, thus indicating {{the origins of the}} 40 GN 9 community members. These analyses also illustrate the creation of a unique potting tradition at 40 GN 9 characterized by ceramics with smudged or undecorated exteriors, signaling the making of a shared cultural identity. Such research contributes to the growing body of research concerning the dynamic nature of Native American life before, during, and after contact with Europeans and counteracts a tendency among scholars and the wider public toward viewing native societies as static and unchanging. Moreover, it demonstrates how Cherokee women were actively involved in the dynamic process of community coalescence and identity formation in the late Mississippian and protohistoric time periods...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall {{extremes}} {{are typically}} represented {{by means of}} Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. Different methods {{have been developed to}} estimate these curves from historical rainfall records. These include methods based on annual maxima series (AMS), peaks over threshold (POT) values and marginal distribution information. While annual maximum values are most directly relevant to the IDF values, they have the drawback of reducing one year worth of data to a single value. By contrast, POT and marginal-distribution methods utilize the data more fully, but rely on simplifying assumptions to estimate the IDF curves. The AMS approach, which is widely used in hydrology, can have different complexities depending on the parameterization and estimation procedure. The method assumes a parametric or nonparametric dependence of the extremes on the return period T and the duration d. There is theoretical and empirical evidence that certain assumptions of the method (e. g. that the multiplicative effect of T is the same for different d) are incorrect. The POT approach produces results that may be sensitive to the threshold. Also this method requires assumptions, most critically on the type of <b>distribution</b> of the <b>POT</b> values. Marginal <b>distribution</b> methods assume independence of the rainfall process in non-overlapping d intervals. This assumption generally overestimates the IDF values but is accurate for very long return periods T. Another assumption concerns the form of the marginal distribution, in particular in the upper tail. We have significant empirical evidence that this tail has a lognormal shape. If the rainfall process displays multifractal scale invariance, then this condition can be used to regularize the dependence of the marginal distribution on d. In a “hybrid” variant of the marginal method it is possible to include information on the annual maxima. We compare the above IDF estimation methods at selected sites of mainland Portugal. The rainfall records typically include 20 or more years of high-resolution data and about 60 years of daily precipitation values...|$|R

The growth responses of native Australian legumes in agricultural soils with elevated P availability in the surface horizons are unknown. The aim of these experiments was {{to test the hypothesis}} that increased P concentration in surface soil would reduce root proliferation at depth in native legumes. The effect of P placement on root distribution was assessed for two Australian legumes, Kennedia prorepens F. Muell. and Lotus australis Andrews, and the exotic Medicago sativa L. Three treatments were established in a low-P loam soil: amendment of 0. 15 g mono-calcium phosphate in either (i) the top 50 mm (120 µg P g– 1) or (ii) the top 500 mm (12 µg P g– 1) of soil, and an unamended control. In the unamended soil M. sativa was shallow rooted, with 58 % of the root length of in the top 50 mm. K. prorepens and L. australis had a more even <b>distribution</b> down the <b>pot</b> length, with only 4 and 22 % of their roots in the 0 – 50 mm pot section, respectively. When exposed to amendment of P in the top 50 mm, root length in the top 50 mm increased 4 -fold for K. prorepens and 10 -fold for M. sativa, although the pattern of root distribution did not change for M. sativa. L. australis was relatively unresponsive to P additions and had an even distribution of roots down the pot. Shoot P concentrations differed according to species but not treatment (K. prorepens 2. 1 mg g– 1, L. australis 2. 4 mg g– 1, M. sativa 3. 2 mg g– 1). Total shoot P content was higher for K. prorepens than for the other species in all treatments. In a second experiment, mono-ester phosphatases were analysed from 1 -mm slices of soil collected directly adjacent to the rhizosphere. All species exuded phosphatases into the rhizosphere, but addition of P to soil reduced phosphatase activity only for K. prorepens. Overall, high P concentration in the surface soil altered root distribution, but did not reduce root proliferation at depth. Furthermore, the Australian herbaceous perennial legumes had root distributions that enhanced P acquisition from low-P soils...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{availability of}} detailed trajectory data sets from naturalistic, observational and simulation-based studies {{are a key}} source for potential improvements {{in the development of}} detailed safety models that explicitly account for vehicle conflict interactions and the various driving maneuvers. Despite the well-recognized research findings on both crash frequency estimation and traffic conflicts analysis carried out over the last decades, only recently researchers have started to study and model the link between the two. This link is typically made by statistical association between aggregated conflicts and crashes, which still relies on crash data and ignores heterogeneity in the estimation procedure. More recently, an Extreme Value (EV) approach has been used to link the probability of crash occurrence to the frequency of conflicts estimated from observed variability of crash proximity, using a probabilistic framework and without using crash records. In this on-going study the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) -based estimation, in the peak over threshold approach, are tested and compared as EV methods using the minimum time-to-collision with the opposing vehicle during passing maneuvers. Detailed trajectory data of the passing, passed and opposite vehicles from a fixed-based driving simulator experiment was used in this study. One hundred experienced drivers from different demographic strata participated in this experiment on a voluntary base. Several two-lane rural highway layouts and traffic conditions were also considered {{in the design of the}} simulator environment. Raw data was collected at a resolution of 0. 1 s and included the longitudinal and lateral position, speed and acceleration of all vehicles in the scenario. From this raw data, the minimum time-to-collision with the opposing vehicle at the end of the passing, maneuver was calculated. GEV distributions based on the Block Maxima approach and GPD <b>distributions</b> under the <b>POT</b> approach were tested for the estimation of head-on collision probabilities in passing maneuvers with different results. While the GEV approach achieved satisfactory fitting results, the tested POT underestimated the expected number of head-on collisions. Finally, the estimated GEV distributions were validated using a second set of data extracted from an additional driving simulator experiment. The results indicate that this is a promising approach for safety evaluation. On-going work of the authors will attempt to generalize this method to other safety measures related to passing maneuvers, test it for the detailed analysis of the effect of demographic factors on passing maneuvers’ crash probability and for its usefulness in a traffic simulation environmen...|$|R

Foram testadas quatro raças de R. dominica, duas resistentes ao deltamethrin, BR 6 e BR 12, e duas suscetíveis, BR 4 e UK 1, coletadas em unidades armazenadoras de grãos e mantidas em multiplicação em laboratório. O experimento foi realizado em quatro repetições, liberando-se 100 insetos, por repetição, em um pote de plástico contendo grãos de trigo não tratados; esse pote ficava conectado a outro de mesmo tamanho contendo grãos de trigo tratados com CL 5, CL 25 e CL 50 do inseticida deltamethrin, separadamente, para cada raça. O conjunto foi mantido na posição horizontal, de forma a permitir a livre passagem dos insetos entre os dois compartimentos, a 25 ± 1 ºC e 60 ± 5 % de temperatura e de umidade relativa do ar, respectivamente. A avaliação da distribuição dos insetos no interior dos potes ocorreu 12 dias após sua liberação. Os insetos evitaram os grãos tratados com todas as concentrações de deltamethrin, indicando o efeito de repelência que o inseticida exerce sobre eles. No caso das raças suscetíveis, a diferença não foi significativa entre o número de indivíduos nas porções tratadas e não tratadas, nas diferentes concentrações. Por outro lado, os indivíduos das raças resistentes apresentaram um comportamento de repelência significativamente mais acentuado que os das suscetíveis, especialmente nas concentrações mais elevadas.
