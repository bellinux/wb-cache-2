40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the character of the}} pressure drop through <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> <b>pipes</b> by comparing the pressure drops of straight <b>pipes</b> and <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> <b>pipes</b> of comparable relative roughness. The scope of the study was limited to Reynolds Numbers below 10 [superscript 5] and to flow through 3 / 8 and 1 / 2 inch stainless steel tubing of circular cross section. It was further limited by the use of water as the only working fluid and by the fact that no control was established over the exact character of the surface roughness. The results show that the correction factor Hc' is rather insensitive to Reynold's number and that it has greater dependence upon roughness and less dependence upon curvature than was previously thought probable. In addition, it is shown that an empirical formula of the type Hc = 1 + K(r/D) [superscript a](D/Dh) [superscript b] where a >> b, is probably more realistic than the Ac = 1 + 3. 5 D/Dh expressed in current literature. It is further shown that within the scope of this study, the relative roughness, r/D, as determined by the profilometer and the relative roughness ε/D as used by L. F. Moody correspond, and r/D may be used to determine a friction factor from the Moody curves...|$|R

The model is formulated in the Timoshenko beam formalism by first assuming that a cable can be homogenized effectively as a 3 D solid rod continuum following Spencer’s constitutive law. The cross-sectional forces and moments are obtained by integrating the stress components over the cross section and, using the constitutive relations, eigenvalue {{problems of the}} rod are set up by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, thus resulting in the eigenfrequencies and mode shapes. The model has four stiffness parameters, $E, G, C_F$ and $C_T$, which incorporate both the geometrical and material properties of the rod, and are lay-angle dependent. The applicability of the model to <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> cables is then verified by studying the vibration of $ 1 + 6 $ cables (one core and six identical helical wires).

The tubular element {{is considered to}} have constant cross-section and small deformations restricted to a plane.

The {{stiffness and}} mass matrices derived from the <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> tubular composite material are reduced to symmetrically laminated composite beam.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials has constantly increased in aerospace and offshore applications. One of -typical composite structures for offshore application is multilayer unbonded composite pipe. The composite pipe comprised of several layers such as <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> steel layers and polymeric layers, among which the <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> steel wires play essential roles in providing axial and flexural stiffnesses of the pipe. Because of the -geometric nonlinearity of each {{layer of the}} composite pipe and the flexibility in motion of individual layers against their adjacent layers, analyses of the composite pipe are highly nonlinear and computationally challenging. In this study, detailed three-dimensional Representative Volume Element models of the multilayer unbonded composite pipe are developed, and nonlinear analyses of the composite pipe are performed. The developed FE models effectively predict nonlinear responses of the pipe including slipping effects of steel layers under application of axial loading, bending, internal and external pressures.

The final closed-form formulations can handle both the no-slip and/or the traditionally used full-slip coupled extensional/torsional constitutive equations for <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> cables, and describe the various characteristics of the resulting pairs of axial or torsional waves at any location along the cable with one end fixed against movement and the other end subjected to impact loading. By using extensive numerical results, which cover {{the full range of}} current manufacturing limits for the lay angle (with this being the sole controlling geometrical parameter as far as the axial/torsional stiffnesses are concerned), it is shown that significant differences exist between a number of axial/torsional wave characteristics, depending on whether the no-slip or the full-slip version of the constitutive relations is used in the analysis. It is demonstrated that modest increases in the magnitudes of the lay angles can lead to significant increases in the differences between the no-slip and the full-slip wave propagation characteristics. The present findings may have significant practical implications in relation to the currently adopted techniques used by industry for calibrating the electronic boxes, which are subsequently used as permanently installed devices, for the in situ detection of individual wire fractures under, say, fatigue loading associated with cable-supported structures...|$|R

40|$|Properties {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} composites (FRP) arise {{as a function}} of its constituent materials, their distribution, and the interaction among them {{and as a result of}} it an unusual combination of material properties can be obtained. There are various methods of their manufacturing, but filament winding is a very important and widely used technique for FRP production related to civil engineering. The basis of this technology includes winding of resin-impregnated fibers into a tool and hardening of the wound structure. This technology enables the fibers to be placed into the direction of the load that may be expected during exploitation of construction elements. By varying the winding angle with respect to the mandrel axis, directional strength can be obtained by the loads, which will operate on the finished product. It is essential to know the mechanical and thermal characteristics of filament wound tubes in order to employ them in design applications. The focus of this stay was to investigate the mechanical and thermal properties of different glass fiber reinforced composite pipes produced by filament winding technique. So, the research program of the STSM was divided into two tasks. The first one refers to the mechanical characterization, and the second one to the thermal characterization of the epoxy resin and filament <b>wound</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on the investigation in the fame of this STSM, it can be concluded that from the mechanical point of view there are significant differences in the filament <b>wound</b> <b>pipes</b> with different fiber orientation. Regarding the tensile properties, the bigger winding angle lead to higher hoop tensile properties of filament-wound tubular samples. But, for the transverse compression properties of composite specimens the lower winding angle lead to higher transverse compression properties of the samples. The optimal mechanical properties have the samples on the primary level winded with angle 450.
