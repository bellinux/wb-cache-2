He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work as a family again. Losing Natalie {{is going to be}} really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, American rapper Machine Gun Kelly {{released}} the mixtape Black Flag, {{which included a}} cover of [...] "Swing Life Away". The cover has new verses written by Kelly, and features guest vocals by Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens. Rise Against approved of the cover, after Kelly {{wrote a letter to}} the band explaining that he [...] "wouldn’t <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them or their song look corny". Originally, Quinn had recorded vocals for an acoustic rendition, but Kelly decided against this, insisting that the cover be more melodic rock.|$|E

She worked hard to make her character believable (with help from Khan, who had previous experience with the director). Sharma's character, Akira, {{was described as}} a [...] "21-year-old who works for the Discovery Channel and makes documentaries. She is on a quest to discover the truth behind the story of The Man Who Cannot Die (Samar Anand) in the film. She is extremely ambitious and will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it big and realize her dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand {{did not like to}} listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, to {{celebrate}} Neighbours 25th anniversary, British satellite broadcasting company, Sky UK, profiled twenty-five characters {{of which they}} believed were the most memorable in the series history. Paul is in the list and joke about his many wives stating: [...] "How many of Paul's five wives can you name? No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that we love to hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to {{the story}} that has been recited by fans and the band for years, there was never an ad placed that said [...] "Drummer willing to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it." [...] The {{advertisement}} was answered by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, who were looking for new members for their band. Ace Frehley {{was added to the}} lineup in December 1972, and the band was named Kiss later that month.|$|E

2500|$|Thorne and Taylor {{later become}} {{involved}} again in 2011, when they team {{up against the}} Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: [...] " [...] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to {{have a shot at}} Forrester in the driver’s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." [...] However, Tylo saw that there was a [...] "sticky point" [...] between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor [...] "would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for that". The actress said, [...] "I think it’s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. [...] I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn’t look forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), {{landlord}} of The Queen Victoria pub, {{decides to}} start a pub football team, he struggles {{to get people to}} sign up. His wife Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) takes over as manager and flirts to get people to sign up. After the first match, they host a party and Kat flirts with her chef Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), former lover Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) and brothers Max (Jake Wood), Jack (Scott Maslen) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen person enters and he and Kat have sex. She feels guilty the next day and tries to ignore his calls and text messages. She finally responds to a phone call and meets him to ask him to leave her alone. However, as he walks away she changes her mind and they continue the affair. She then fears Alfie will find out so tries to end the affair again. Her lover sends her a mobile phone to contact him on, but she bins it. However, when a romantic evening with Alfie goes wrong, she retrieves the phone and contacts her lover. She later receives a key to a nearby flat, and when Alfie pays more attention to the organisation of the football team, Kat heads to the flat to meet her lover, who is waiting. The affair continues with Alfie clueless. Kat hears that a fight has broken out between members of the football team, and fears that the truth has come out. However, it has not. The fight spills over into The Queen Victoria, and later, Kat tends to her lover's wounds. Alfie catches them but is none the wiser. The mystery man later leaves Kat a bandage with [...] "I love you" [...] written on in lipstick. Kat hides it in with some laundry. Alfie then asks Kat to move out following an outbreak of bed bugs in the pub. She does not want to go as she does not want to continue her affair, but she cannot resist. Alfie later finds the bandage, but assumes it is from Kat and sends her a message in the pub's window saying [...] "I love you 2". Kat later ignores her lover's messages, and he tells her that he has got the message—that she is no longer interested. She throws away the key, but it is found by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who leaves it on the bar, thinking it belongs to a punter. Kat then takes it and later meets her lover at the flat. Kat ends up staying the night and gets her friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) to cover for her the next day. Kat receives flowers from her lover, and tells Alfie they are from her father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin). Kat angrily telephones her lover, telling him she will always contact him. Alfie then grows suspicious, as Charlie would not send roses to Kat, and asks her to be honest with him. Kat then admits to having an affair. Alfie demands to know the details but Kat refuses to tell him who her lover is. Alfie ejects Kat from their home, where she meets Michael, to whom she discloses the affair. He urges Kat to fix her relationship, so she goes back to Alfie and says she will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it right. He gets her to phone her lover and tell him that the affair is over for good. After this, she smashes her phone and the couple go away on a [...] "make or break" [...] holiday.|$|E

Hagler did better, but Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight.

60|$|I think I shall {{like the}} Scotch people very much, but just {{now there is}} one thing about them that stands up as high above their other good points as the castle does above the rest of the city, and that is the feeling they have for anybody who has <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his fellow-countrymen proud of him.
