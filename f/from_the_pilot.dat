Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; {{the series is}} animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series {{as well as a}} detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Stargate Command (SGC) base was {{supposed}} to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible. The set had to be twice as high for shooting as the 22 feet tall Stargate prop, but one of Hudolin's original plans of a three-level SGC set was rejected {{in favor of a}} two-level set. The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel's lab, the cafeteria or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.|$|E

5|$|The {{results were}} {{promising}} and John Larson was appointed Director of Leadership Development. He {{was charged with}} continuing support for the experiment. During 1969, Gene Rutherford of the Circle Ten Council along with the Course Directors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> programs—Crawford, Stevens, Whisler and Carl Marlowe of the Hiawatha Councils—were charged with evaluating the project. They continued pilot-testing and experimenting with the program for three more years, through 1972. They also began developing an experimental junior leader training program that utilized the White Stag competencies.|$|E
5|$|The show borrows {{elements}} and its design style from his Uncle Grandpa short, which was pitched {{to the network}} as a pilot. According to Browngardt, they were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to help shape the project's development.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary style as The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two different angles intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. The pilot episode also makes use of the jump cut technique more often than in The Office. In one example <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E

Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
