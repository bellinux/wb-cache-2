5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an important point of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E

50|$|Blackett {{was very}} refined and well mannered, he <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> {{a very good}} upbringing, he was quiet and reserved, {{but at the same}} time could be genial and kind, {{particularly}} with friends.|$|R
500|$|The {{reception}} to {{the novel}} {{was so bad that}} Fleming wrote to Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, to explain why he wrote the book: [...] "I had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers... the experiment <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> gone very much awry".|$|E
500|$|Coonskin, {{advertised as}} an {{exploitation}} film, was given limited distribution and soon disappeared from theaters. Initial reviews were negative; Playboy commented that [...] "Bakshi seems {{to throw in}} a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together." [...] Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The Hollywood Reporter, New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper) and elsewhere. The New York Times Richard Eder said the film [...] "could be [...] masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [...] exploit violence". Variety called it a [...] "brutal satire from the streets". A reviewer for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner wrote, [...] "Certainly, it will outrage some and, indeed, it's not Disney. [...] The dialog it <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> generated—if not the box office obstacles—seems joltingly healthy." [...] Bakshi called Coonskin his best film.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} Kim Randell {{noted that}} [...] "Gearbox <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> {{gone to great}} pains to provide a similar experience to the original". Praise was also given to the game's multiplayer; Randell stated that the new additions for multiplayer made it the area of Opposing Force that [...] "really shines". Randell closed the review by concluding that Opposing Force is [...] "an awesome achievement". Erik Wolpaw, writing for GameSpot, noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre, [...] "it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs". Wolpaw praised {{the design of the}} single-player campaign, commenting that [...] "you can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing". Although criticizing some elements of the game's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as [...] "merely window dressing", the review concluded that Opposing Force was an [...] "impassioned application of creative design".|$|E
60|$|Ellams drained {{his glass}} and Marston noted that his hand shook. The man <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> {{suffered}} much from ague and fever.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped for}} a few moments and Lister began to feel some sympathy. The man was desperate and <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> borne much.|$|R

500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, a nifty, '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E
2500|$|An axe murderer (Foley) {{approaches}} {{people for}} favours after he <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> committed a brutal and grisly homicide with the axe he's carrying. Covered in blood, he makes polite small talk with people he runs into, casually admitting he is, in fact, an axe murderer. Before leaving, he amiably asks whoever {{he talks to}} not to tell anyone or [...] "Chop chop!", accompanied by a chopping motion with his axe.|$|E
60|$|But, {{even as he}} said this, he <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> {{given up}} his search, and walked {{straight}} towards Mrs. Gould, who {{looked at him with}} doubtful surprise.|$|R
50|$|The crown {{argued that}} the crime was premeditated and that Gee couldn't have been insane, as he <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> {{realized}} his crime when he turned himself in.|$|R
50|$|This appeal by {{the emperor}} {{encouraged}} {{the citizens of}} Emden to reject {{the authority of the}} Count. He <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> lost his authority, and this triggered the revolution.|$|R
2500|$|The nearby tower {{house of}} Castledillon {{passed to the}} de Hereford and Rochford {{families}} (1359) until it too fell into disrepair – now only the foundations remain. A Wogan family tower house [...] "in the north part of Richardstown townland" [...] described as [...] "a square building about [...] in height' by Thomas O'Conor in 1837 is now reduced to a pile of stones and mortar which <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> been moved from its original location.|$|E
2500|$|A {{visit by}} the OS in August 1982 stated that [...] "It is {{difficult}} to make any accurate assessment of this feature. It <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> been altered and landscaped beyond any recognition of its original form, and in its present state has an ornamental appearance. Situated {{on the edge of}} a natural N–S scarp line at approximately 60 m, it is possible that this was at one time just a slightly raised promontory, but as such, it is almost certainly not a motte and would be more typical of a homestead position in this region.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The glacier {{has been}} one of the most photographed glaciers in the park and many of these {{photographs}} date back to the mid 19th century. When compared with images taken over subsequent years, the glacier <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> retreated substantially. In 1850, at the end of what has been referred to as the Little Ice Age, Grinnell Glacier measured , including the area of The Salamander Glacier, an ice apron or shelf glacier that used to be attached to Grinnell, but is now separate. By 1993, Grinnell Glacier measured [...] and The Salamander measured [...]|$|E

2500|$|The new {{gameplay}} mechanics received mixed opinions from reviewers. Daemon Hatfield of IGN {{praised the}} addition of new weaponry but noted that those who played the first game will need no introduction to Thongs of Virtue gameplay, stating [...] "It will feel very familiar to anyone who played the first DeathSpank, but it remains incredibly addictive." [...] 1UP.com's Cocke felt that more {{could have been done}} to differentiate Thongs of Virtue from its predecessor. He commended Hothead Games for releasing the sequel so quickly, but felt [...] "that [...] <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> {{come at the expense of}} any big improvements over the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality {{and its role in}} his work: [...] "I'd say that my poetry <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lira was {{established}} at 4.5grams of silver or 290.322 milligrams of gold. This {{was a direct}} continuation of the Sardinian lira. Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the Lombardy-Venetia pound, the Two Sicilies piastra, the Tuscan fiorino, the Papal States scudo and the Parman lira. In 1865, Italy formed part of the Latin Monetary Union in which the lira was set as equal to, among others, the French, Belgian and Swiss francs: in fact, in various Gallo-Italic dialects in north-western Italy, the lira was outright called [...] "franc". This practice <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> ended {{with the introduction of}} the euro in 2002.|$|E

6000|$|George, {{on hearing}} the story, grinned. The hat <b>had</b> <b>obviously</b> been worn as a {{practical}} joke! He himself was a connoisseur of such. [...] "Very haughty!" [...] he said, [...] "the wild Buccaneer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Geronimo's {{participation}} in the [...] "What Love Is..." [...] with Martin Nievera concert was described by Baby A. Gil of the Philippine Star with the comment, [...] "Who needs a dancing Martin anyway {{when you have the}} long-limbed Sarah there, who is a daring, enthusiastic dancer? I like watching her dance and finding her moving even better now than the last time is a treat. Of course, she has also become an even better singer. To those who are wont to ask, has she gotten rid of her Celine Dion tendencies? Well, she still sings a good To Love You More, but she <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> come to her own with fuller tones, nice, sexy low notes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{finished}} {{writing his}} script in March 1976, when the crew started filming. He said, [...] "What finally emerged through the many drafts {{of the script}} <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure I've read and seen. And I've {{seen a lot of}} it. I'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture, a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together. There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in Star Wars." [...] During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars. He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the film were mixed. Playboy said of the film, [...] "Bakshi seems to throw in a little of {{everything}} and he can't quite pull it together." [...] A review published in The Village Voice called the film [...] "the product of a crippled hand and a paralyzed mind." [...] Arthur Cooper wrote in Newsweek, [...] " [...] doesn't have much affection for man or woman kind—black or white." [...] Eventually, positive reviews appeared in The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, the New York Amsterdam News (an African American newspaper), and elsewhere, but the film died at the box office. Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote, [...] " [...] could be his masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined—to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [...] exploit violence." [...] Variety called the film a [...] "brutal satire from the streets. Not for all tastes [...] not avant-garde. [...] The target audience is youth who read comics in the undergrounds." [...] A reviewer for The Los Angeles Herald Examiner wrote [...] "Certainly, it will outrage some and indeed it's not Disney. I liked it. The dialogue it <b>has</b> <b>obviously</b> generated—if not the box office obstacles—seems joltingly healthy." ...|$|E
