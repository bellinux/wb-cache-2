[...] The program goals are to improve understanding of other health professions and to provide and promote a team approach to patient-centered care and health care management, leading to improved patient care. While a debate exists as {{to the effectiveness of}} interprofessional education in encouraging collaborative practice, interprofessional education is increasingly a common component in health science curricula in the United States, and many groups, including the World Health Organization, view it as a means of reducing medical errors and improving the health care system.|$|E

2500|$|The Hebrew Theological College, known colloquially as [...] "Skokie Yeshiva," [...] is a Yeshiva in Skokie, Illinois, {{which also}} {{functions}} as a private university on campus.

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} at Temple Emanu-El in New York City on February 24, 1912, Henrietta Szold {{together}} with other Zionist women, proposed to the Daughters of Zion study circle that they expand their purpose and embrace proactive work to help meet the health needs of Palestine's people. The goal was to promote the Zionist ideal through education, public health initiatives, and the training of nurses {{in what was then}} the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire. Because the meeting was held around the time of Purim, the women called themselves [...] "The Hadassah chapter of the Daughters of Zion," [...] adopting the Hebrew name of Queen Esther. Henrietta Szold became the first president. Within a year, Hadassah had five growing chapters in New York, Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Boston. Its charter articulates twin goals: to begin public-health initiatives and nurses training in Palestine, and to foster Zionist ideals through <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{argued that}} students in public schools {{do not have a}} right to free speech and that Tinker should be overturned. Thomas wrote, [...] "In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools." [...] He praised Hugo Black's dissenting opinion on Tinker and called it [...] "prophetic". Thomas cited the doctrine of in loco parentis, meaning [...] "in place of the parent", in his opinion. He traced the history of public <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. [...] "In short", he continues, [...] "in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed." [...] He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted Tinker for [...] "usurping [...] traditional authority for the judiciary". Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection [...] "would...be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{excellence}} of Oxford, then, as I see it, {{lies in the}} peculiar vagueness of the organisation of its work. It starts from {{the assumption that the}} professor is a really learned man whose sole interest lies in his own sphere: and that a student, or at least the only student with whom the university cares to reckon seriously, is a young man who desires to know. This is an ancient mediaeval attitude long since buried in more up-to-date places under successive strata of compulsory education, state teaching, the democratisation of knowledge and the substitution of the shadow for the substance, and the casket for the gem. No doubt, in newer places the thing has got to be so. Higher <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> flourishes chiefly as a qualification for entrance into a money-making profession, and not as a thing in itself. But in Oxford one can still see the surviving outline of a nobler type of structure and a higher inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|At {{any rate}} I {{can at least}} claim that my {{acquaintance}} with the British university is just as good a basis for reflection and judgment {{as that of the}} numerous English critics who come to our side of the water. I have known a famous English author to arrive at Harvard University in the morning, have lunch with President Lowell, and then write a whole chapter on the Excellence of Higher <b>Education</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> I have known another one come to Harvard, have lunch with President Lowell, and do an entire book on the Decline of Serious Study in America. Or take the case of my own university. I remember Mr. Rudyard Kipling coming to McGill and saying in his address to the undergraduates at 2.30 P.M., [...] "You have here a great institution." [...] But how could he have gathered this information? As far as I know he spent the entire morning with Sir Andrew Macphail in his house beside the campus, smoking cigarettes. When I add that he distinctly refused to visit the Palaeontologic Museum, that he saw nothing of our new hydraulic apparatus, or of our classes in Domestic Science, his judgment that we had here a great institution seems a little bit superficial. I can only put beside it, to redeem it in some measure, the hasty and ill-formed judgment expressed by Lord Milner, [...] "McGill is a noble university": and the rash and indiscreet expression of the Prince of Wales, when we gave him an LL.D. degree, [...] "McGill has a glorious future." ...|$|E
