50|$|In {{practice}} Schlenk bombs {{can perform}} {{many of the}} functions of a standard Schlenk flask. Even when the opening is used to fit a bomb to a manifold, the plug can still be removed to add or remove material from the bomb. In some situations, however, Schlenk bombs are less convenient than standard Schlenk flasks: they lack an accessible ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> to attach additional apparatus; the opening provided by plug valves {{can be difficult to}} access with a spatula, and it can be much simpler to work with a septum designed to fit a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> than with a Teflon plug.|$|E
5000|$|Separatory funnels {{are similar}} in shape and design, and {{may be used as}} {{dropping}} funnels. They do not always have the ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> at the stem, instead having a narrow tube suitable for insertion into a rubber stopper.|$|E

50|$|A Schlenk-frit is a {{laboratory}} filtration device operating {{under inert gas}} conditions (schlenk conditions). It separates air- and water-sensitive suspensions into liquid and solid parts. A Schlenk-frit is made of a glass tube with a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> at both ends, a fused filter (a porous glass disk) and valves at both sides.|$|E

50|$|Ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} in {{laboratories}} to quickly and easily fit leak-tight apparatus together from commonly available parts. For example, a round bottom flask, Liebig condenser, and oil bubbler with ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> may be rapidly fitted together to reflux a reaction mixture. This is a large improvement compared with older methods of custom-made glassware, which was time-consuming and expensive, {{or the use of}} less chemical resistant and heat resistant corks or rubber bungs and <b>glass</b> tubes as <b>joints,</b> which took time to prepare as well.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{connectors}} or adapters are {{hollow glassware}} components with ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> open at {{one or both}} ends.|$|R
50|$|A {{drying tube}} or guard tube is a tube-like piece of {{apparatus}} used to house a disposable solid desiccant, wherein {{at one end}} the tube-like structure terminates in a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> for use in connecting the drying tube to a reaction vessel, {{for the purpose of}} keeping the vessel free of moisture.|$|E
5000|$|A gas bubbler is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} glassware which consists of a glass bulb filled {{with a small amount of}} fluid [...] - [...] usually mineral or silicone oil, less commonly mercury. The inlet to the bulb is connected to a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint,</b> while the outlet is vented to the air.|$|E
50|$|The Pirani gauge {{consists}} of a metal filament (usually platinum) suspended in a tube which {{is connected to the}} system whose vacuum is to be measured. Connection is usually made either by a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> or a flanged metal connector, sealed with an o-ring. The filament is connected to an electrical circuit from which, after calibration, a pressure reading may be taken.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{scientists}} constructed {{their own}} laboratory apparatus {{prior to the}} ubiquity of interchangeable ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints.</b> Today, commercially available parts connected by ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available glass tubes by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large glass tubes, connected by stopcocks and smaller glass tubes, which are further connected to plastic hoses.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} Schlenk flask is a round bottom, pear-shaped, or tubular flask with {{a ground}} <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> and a side arm. The side arm contains a valve, usually a greased stopcock, {{used to control}} the flask's exposure to a manifold or the atmosphere. This allows a material {{to be added to}} a flask through the ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint,</b> which is then capped with a septum. This operation can, for example, be done in a glove box. The flask can then be removed from the glove box and taken to a Schlenk line. Once connected to the Schlenk line, the inert gas and/or vacuum {{can be applied to the}} flask as required. While the flask is connected to the line under a positive pressure of inert gas, the septum can be replaced with other apparatus, for example a reflux condenser. Once the manipulations are complete, the contents can be vacuum dried and placed under a static vacuum by closing the side arm valve. These evacuated flasks can be taken back into a glove box for further manipulation or storage of the flasks' contents.|$|E
50|$|Distillation flasks, {{which are}} {{intended}} to contain mixtures, which are subject to distillation, {{as well as to}} receive the products of distillation, distillation flasks are available in various shapes. Similar to the reaction flask, the distillation flasks usually have only one narrow neck and a ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> and are made of thinner glass than the reaction flask, so that it is easier to heat. They are sometimes spherical, test tube shaped, or pear-shaped, also known as a Kjeldahl Flask, due to its use with Kjeldahl bulbs.|$|E

5000|$|Dropping funnels are a cylindrical, {{regularly}} graduated funnel {{with standard}} taper ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints.</b> These are often supplied with a pressure equalizer.|$|R
50|$|For larger volumes, {{it may be}} {{preferable}} to connect the donor and receiving flasks via ground <b>glass</b> <b>joints</b> to a sintered glass filter tube.|$|R
50|$|Pressure-equalizing {{dropping}} funnels have {{an additional}} narrow-bore glass tube from the bulb of the funnel, {{to the ground}} <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> around the stem. These replace the liquid volume lost in the bulb with the equivalent gas volume from the flask into which the reagent is flowing, and are useful when handling air-sensitive reagents in a sealed, inert-gas environment. Without this tube, or some other means to equalize the pressure between a sealed receiving flask and the bulb of the funnel, the flow of fluid from the bulb will rapidly come to a halt.|$|E
5000|$|Florence flask: A flask {{similar to}} the {{flat-bottomed}} flask that has round bodies and either a round bottom or a flat bottom so that one can stand the flask on a level surface. Florence flasks typically have one neck which is longer and may be somewhat wider than the usual neck of a round bottom flask. The necks of traditional Florence flasks often {{do not have a}} ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> like modern round bottom flasks do. Round-bottom flasks are used more commonly by professional chemists than Florence flasks.|$|E
50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or {{sometimes}} volumetric flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints. Some flasks, especially volumetric flasks, come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground <b>glass</b> <b>joint</b> surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|E
