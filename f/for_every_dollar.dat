5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. <b>For</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> initially invested.|$|E

New York University economist Thomas Philippon supported those findings, estimating that the US spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers {{in research and development}} add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> they are paid.

500|$|After the war, Lawrence campaigned {{extensively}} {{for government}} sponsorship of large scientific programs. He was a forceful advocate of Big Science with its requirements for big machines and big money, and in 1946 {{he asked the}} Manhattan Project for over $2 million for research at the Radiation Laboratory. Groves approved the money, but cut a number of programs, including Seaborg's proposal for a [...] "hot" [...] radiation laboratory in densely populated Berkeley, and John Lawrence's for production of medical isotopes, because this need could now be better met from nuclear reactors. One obstacle was the University of California, which was eager to divest its wartime military obligations. Lawrence and Groves managed to persuade Sproul to accept a contract extension.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Briskin had gained a {{reputation}} of being a very thrifty producer. However, he was also known for putting {{the quality of the}} product over saving money. Joseph Walker, the cinematographer for the 1931 film Dirigible, directed by Frank Capra, explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps, which would have been much less expensive: , the studio's general manager, who personally supervised the making of the picture, and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar's worth of production <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> spent than any other executive in the business, was wise enough to see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made [...] "merely adequate".

2500|$|Cabinet {{documents}} and the previously secret business case and construction contract details were {{released by the}} incoming state government in December 2014, revealing {{for the first time}} the costing rationale for the project.

When [...] "wider economic benefits" [...] were factored in, the return rose to 84 cents <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> spent. Cabinet documents showed the Napthine government opted not to submit the business case to Infrastructure Australia, fearing it could reject the project because of the poor cost-benefit ratio. Three months later the government prepared a new business case that included other measures, including the widening of CityLink, the Tullamarine Freeway and the Eastern Freeway, to produce an estimated return of $1.40 <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> invested. Those figures were used by the government in a short-form business case it presented to Infrastructure Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing out that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} are saving less or going deeper into debt. A [...] "growing body of work" [...] suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 cents <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> of income to $1.40. Economist Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in the United States over the last hundred years.|$|E
