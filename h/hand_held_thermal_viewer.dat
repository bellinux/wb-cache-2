Inside the helmet {{there is a}} screen that allows firefighters to view the thermal imaging results {{at the same time}} they are viewing outside the mask. The image appears in the peripheral view, at nine frames per second over a period of up to four hours. The camera and display mounted in the helmet weighs 8.5 ounces.|$|R
40|$|Fogging of Rejex-it® TP- 40 (Fog Force) {{offers a}} very {{efficient}} method {{for the management}} of nuisance birds in many diverse areas without any adverse effects to non-target animals. Despite its effectiveness, there are many factors that influence the effectiveness and desired results. The product alone does not guarantee the desired success. It is not always the quantity that determines fast reaction, but more the form for the specific application. Smaller droplets in the 10 -micron range are theoretically 27 times more effective than 30 micron droplets and five micron droplets even 216 times more effective for the same quantity of product applied. It has been shown that droplets below 10 microns are inhaled by birds much more and therefore show an increase in effectiveness. Also, birds in flight with a breathing rate of 50 - 100 times higher than the resting rate show increased effectiveness. Large droplets not only are relatively ineffective, they also tend to drop to the ground prematurely and are lost. Smaller droplets stay in the air much longer and disappear by evaporation and do not drop to the ground. In large warehouses or hangars it is therefore advisable to bring the fogger to the height where the birds are, so that the fog stays in the upper regions without disturbing any operation on the ground floor. Depending on the situation, it sometimes is still advantageous to use foggers, which do not produce the ideal droplet size, but have other advantages that are needed for success. In strong wind or with thermal currents sometimes larger droplets are needed to reach the nuisance birds. Also, many times automated ULV foggers (e. g., Hurricane, BICO 2000), that work without much noise are more effective than <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>thermal</b> foggers...|$|R

50|$|The gun is {{electrically}} stabilized on two axes by the EADS computer aided {{stabilization system}}. The new stabilization system improves {{the accuracy of}} the main gun and reduces the target engagement time, turret temperature, noise, fire hazard and maintenance. The turret has RKS roller bearings to ensure a better stabilisation of the A308 gun. The gunner's day sight telescopic periscope features an integrated laser rangefinder (200 m to 5.000 m measurement distance) and an electronic reticle. Above the gun barrel there is a SAGEM MATIS passive <b>thermal</b> <b>viewer</b> designed to operate at wavelengths between 3 and 5 μm in the spectral band. Initially, the TR-85 M1 tanks had an inferior SAGEM ALIS passive <b>thermal</b> <b>viewer</b> (8-12 μm in the spectral band) for the gunner, now present in export configurations. The driver has an AONP-I passive night sight, which is also the standard night vision device for the gunner on the older TR-85 tanks. The commander has a SFIM (Société Française des Instruments de Mesure) EC2−55R panoramic sight with a second generation SAGEM image intensification system that can be independently directed to the target.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{handheld}} {{computers in}} medicine {{has increased in}} the last decade, they are now used {{in a variety of}} clinical settings. There is an underlying assumption that electronic data capture is more accurate that paper-based data methods have been rarely tested. This report documents a study to compare the accuracy of <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data capture versus more traditional paper-based methods. Methods Clinical nurses involved in a randomised controlled trial collected patient information on a <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer in parallel with a paper-based data form. Both sets of data were entered into an access database and the <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data compared to the paper-based data for discrepancies. Results Error rates from the handheld computers were 67. 5 error per 1000 fields, compared to the accepted error rate of 10 per 10, 000 field for paper-based double data entry. Error rates were highest in field containing a default value. Conclusion While popular with staff, unacceptable high error rates occurred with <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers. Training and ongoing monitoring are needed if <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers are to be used for clinical data collection. </p...|$|R
