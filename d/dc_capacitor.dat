50|$|Usually a STATCOM is {{installed}} to support electricity networks {{that have a}} poor power factor and often poor voltage regulation. There are however, other uses, the most common use is for voltage stability.A STATCOM is a voltage source converter (VSC)-based device, with the voltage source behind a reactor. The voltage source is created from a <b>DC</b> <b>capacitor</b> and therefore a STATCOM has very little active power capability. However, its active power capability can be increased if a suitable energy storage device is connected across the DC capacitor.The reactive power at the terminals of the STATCOM depends on the amplitude of the voltage source. For example, if the terminal voltage of the VSC {{is higher than the}} AC voltage at the point of connection, the STATCOM generates reactive current; conversely, when the amplitude of the voltage source is lower than the AC voltage, it absorbs reactive power.The response time of a STATCOM is shorter than that of a static VAR compensator (SVC), mainly due to the fast switching times provided by the IGBTs of the voltage source converter. The STATCOM also provides better reactive power support at low AC voltages than an SVC, since the reactive power from a STATCOM decreases linearly with the AC voltage (as the current can be maintained at the rated value even down to low AC voltage).|$|E

Recently, full back-to-back connected multilevel neutral point diode clamped converters (NPC converter) have been used inhigh-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. Bipolar-connected back-to-back NPC converters have advantages in long-distance HVDCtransmission systems over the full back-to-back connection, but greater difficulty to balance the <b>dc</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage divider on both sending and receiving end NPC converters.

For both converter sides, the control strategytakes in account active and reactive power, which establishes ac grid currents in both ends, and guarantees the balancing of dc bus capacitor voltages inboth NPC converters. Additionally, the semiconductor switching frequency is minimised to reduce switching losses. The performance and robustness of the new fast predictive control strategy, and its capability to solve the <b>DC</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage balancing problem of bipolar-connected back-to-back NPCconverters are evaluated...|$|E

An analytical closed-form expression is derived for the <b>DC</b> <b>capacitor</b> RMS current with the proposed PWM strategy. The analytical expression is validated through simulations and also experimentally.
