5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E
