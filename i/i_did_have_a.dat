2500|$|MTV News's David Basham {{reported}} on May 19, 2001, that Lopez was cast as Slim, and Once and Again actor Billy Campbell was cast as Mitch, a [...] "wealthy contractor" [...] and Slim's abusive husband. Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle, Dan Futterman and Fred Ward were also announced to be co-starring in the film. According to Basham, filming began on May 21, 2001, and {{took place on}} location in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. During a documentary featured on a special edition DVD of the film, Kazan said Lopez was [...] "very good" [...] at creating the character on film [...] "through unscripted details, physical gestures and fiddling with props." [...] He described her emotional acting as [...] "perfect pitch". Apted, who heard urban legends that Lopez was a diva confessed that [...] "She was fantastic" [...] and good to work with. He also noted Lopez [...] "very much on the case, {{and that was very}} impressive." [...] However, years later Lopez confessed that during the filming of Enough, she overworked and had a nervous breakdown. In 2008, she stated: [...] "I was suffering from a lack of sleep. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> kind of nervous breakdown. I froze up on set. Well, not on a set, but in my trailer. I was like, I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything. It was on that movie, Enough. Yeah, I did. I had a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 2, 1998, Saddle Creek {{released}} Letting Off the Happiness, a ten-track {{album that}} displayed a more focused and clearer sound {{than the previous}} album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and of Montreal. Park Ave. bandmate Neely Jenkins also contributed vocals. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster's Athens, Georgia studio. Although {{almost all of the}} tracks feature a full band, [...] "June on the West Coast" [...] is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of his baby brother, a story with a multitude of symbolic meanings. Oberst has referenced the song [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] more than once in his music. The song [...] "An Attempt To Tip the Scales" [...] on the album [...] "Fevers and Mirrors" [...] has a faux interview {{near the end of the}} track (Oberst voiced by Todd Fink), who was a labelmate and had played in other bands with Oberst. The interviewer is Matt Silcock, another labelmate on Saddle Creek Records. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: [...] "So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?" [...] The Oberst impersonator replies: [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> brother who died in a bathtub [...] [...] [...] he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned." [...] "No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that's why they only got one song. It's kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it's a window." [...] Oberst also references the song in [...] "Cartoon Blues" [...] on the Four Winds EP.|$|E
2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E
