50|$|The Joe Bell Site (9MG28) is {{an archaeological}} site located in Morgan County, Georgia {{underneath}} Lake Oconee, but {{prior to the}} 1970s, it was located south of {{the mouth of the}} Apalachee River on the western bank of the Oconee River. The junction of these two rivers could be seen from the site. This site was first visited by Marshall Williams in 1968 at the suggestion of the site’s landowner, Joe Bell, who had discovered various artifacts while the site was being regularly plowed. Because of Interstate construction, Marshall Williams and Mark Williams discovered this site during surface surveys and excavations of the plowed areas. The site was excavated and analyzed by Mark Williams as part of his PhD dissertation. During the 1969 excavations, four areas within the site were designated for excavation. In Areas 1-3 various five foot square units were excavated. No excavations were done in Area 4 in 1969. Large quantities of small potsherds were discovered during these excavations, and they ranged from the Duvall Phase in Area 1 to Bell Phase in Areas 2-4. As part of the 1969 excavations, a road <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> took off the topsoil of twelve strips on the site. This uncovered Features 1 and 2, and they were completely excavated. In 1977, the site was revisited by Marshall Williams and Mark Williams. Since various plans threatened this site, major excavations took place from June 15, 1977 until September 16, 1977 by Mark Williams. Most of the work centered on Area 2 or the Bell Phase portion of the site. The Bell Phase portion of this site was probably no more the 1.5 acres. Because of time constraints, only 17 of 55 features were excavated, and no {{more than a handful of}} the 1100 posts were excavated. A few trips were made back to the site the following year with the help of volunteers, and approximately 80% of the area stripped by heavy machinery was mapped. Some of the features were trash features that consisted of a circular pit filled with food residues and pottery sherds. Evidence of a large circular structure or rotunda was found at the site. It was the social, political, and religious center for the inhabitants. A large quantity of the features was small, circular, semi-subterranean structures that were probably used as sleeping quarters on cold nights. Another structure found was warm weather structures. One major trash feature was found that had been deposited in a single episode and was burned during or after deposition. Numerous sherds were found in this pit, and a large number of reconstructable vessels were present. Ethnohistoric literature of the Southeast suggests that this feature was formed during a Busk or Green Corn ceremony. The ceremony has been described as the physical cleansing of the town.|$|E

40|$|Machine grading systems operate {{according}} to similar principles; one or more strength related properties of the timber to be graded are measured non-destructively by the machine and based on these measurements a population of un-graded timber is subdivided into sub-populations of graded timber material. The grading acceptance criteria are formulated in form of boundary values for the indicating property {{that have to be}} matched to qualify a piece of timber to a certain grade. These boundaries are termed <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> settings. The performance, i. e. the statistical characteristics of the output of grading machines strongly depends on these settings, and in general very much attention is kept on how to control them. Currently applied procedures to control the <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> settings are either machine controlled or output controlled, however, both procedures do not facilitate the efficient use of information which is gained prior and during the operation phase of the grading facility.

40|$|AbstractImprovement {{of quality}} and value {{addition}} of agricultural produces has gained higher concern in recent times in Sri Lanka due to creation of new opportunities for sale of agricultural commodities in open market at competitive prices. Grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. And also {{the price of the}} many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. Uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. At present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. In Sri Lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. And also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. Hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost size <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> for size grading of big onion bulbs. Size <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> was fabricated by cast iron and PVC tube and It was designed for grading of onion bulbs into three sizes i. e. small (φ 6 cm). <b>Grading</b> <b>machine</b> was also fabricated to operate either by manual or electric motor.

This {{can be achieved by}} different approaches that are represented in the current standard and pre-standard. The pre-standard defines a parametric and non-parametric calculation of characteristic properties from test results, which is the essential difference between various approaches. In both the non-parametric approach and the standard procedure, some simplifications and adjustment factors are used while in the parametric calculation only equations from a theoretical background are used. Procedures are derived for eight different strength grade combination and for all results comparisons are made. With the Mathematica software we used simulations to test given equations for the calculation of characteristic properties. Special consideration was taken on the non-parametrical calculation. The correction factor equation has not proved to be suitable, at least not for the assumptions that are made in the pre-standard. Therefore, we produced a new equation, which gives better results. A new strength <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> is under development, which is not yet standardized and cannot formally be used for strength grading and CE marking yet. The requirements for the derivation of machine settings for initial type testing were met and we established new settings. We tried different properties as the indicative property.

Using size matrix and global cost matrix, we evaluated <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> performance for data with measured density and data with constant density for each of the strength grade combination.

The thesis is issued by NTNU, and it is a part of a project in which Searis AS, Troms Kr&# 229;kebolle and Norway Sea Urchins are participants. Searis AS is a start-up company, in which the student is a participant. Troms Kr&# 229;kebolle and Norway Sea Urchins perform aquaculture farming, and wild catch, of sea urchins, respectively. The project was initated because of the need to automate the manual grading of sea urchins. The grading process is time consuming and increase cost for the customer. The grading involves sorting the sea urchins by their shell diameter, and removing foreign objects like stones. An iterative product development process formed the foundation for the results in this thesis. The process consited of; analysing user and customer needs and requirements, problem decomposition, development of solutions, ranking and rating, breakdown of principal solutions, tests, discussion and choice of concepts. Input for the designprocess was based on discussion with pilot customers; Troms Kr&# 229;kebolle and Norway Sea Urchin, creative sessions with Searis AS, search for competitive products, computer simulations, and lab experiments. A complete system for the grading of sea urchins is proposed at principal level, and design for the for critical components of an automated <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> is presented.

Until now, grading process is still carried out fully manual, so that the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is as a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, machine for grading coffee beans is good alternative for grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table vibration type coffee <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> for grouping of coffee beans in order to consistent quality and reduce grading cost. The machine has dimension of 272 cm length, 126 cm height, and 144 cm width. The machine has three primary components, i. e. grader table, combustion engine, and beam. The machine has three kinds of grader table that each grader table has different holes size, i. e. 7 mm x 7 mm for top grader table, 5 mm x 5 mm for axle grader table, and 4 mm x 4 mm for bottom grader table. Each grader table has dimension of 206 cm length, 105. 5 cm height, and 14 cm width. The grading mechanism is by vibration grader table with the power source 5. 5 HP combustion engine.
