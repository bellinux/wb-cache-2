5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium <b>deposits,</b> <b>and</b> disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the usability of the <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> withdrawal slips for individuals with mental retardation in Taiwan. This paper first described the current state of the <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> withdrawal services in Taiwan to individuals with mental retardation. The person with mental retardation often tried hard to adapt himself/herself to the existing <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> withdrawal slips. This paper addressed the difficulties faced by users with mental retardation in comprehending the contents of the <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> withdrawal slips. The investigation into the low usability showed no consideration for meeting the demand of users with mental retardation. Thus, this paper proposed a new design of the <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> withdrawal slips that are adapted to users with mental retardation. The design approach was based on the principle of Universal Design. This paper finally offered some conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|R

40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan services is to view the differentials between actual loan <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rates <b>and</b> appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan services. ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan services prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan services prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan service prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> loan service prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R

A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{due to its}} {{northern}} location, the peninsula's population had been sparse: in 1913, for example, only about 13,000–15,000 people lived there; mostly along the shores. However, {{the discovery of the}} vast natural resource <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, the population of the peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010.|$|E

The mining company Sydvaranger was established by German and Swedish investors in 1906. A separation plant was built in Kirkenes and the company decided to transport all ore from the mine to the port by rail. Inge T.

Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
