5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E
500|$|Ottman had {{to compose}} {{music for the}} North African battle before the scene was shot, because booking space to record film music is difficult. Although he found that {{composing}} music based on the script results in overlong pieces, he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence. The film's end credits piece, [...] "They'll Remember You", is an original composition, but the lyrics {{were based on the}} poem [...] "Wanderer's Nightsong" [...] by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> entitled [...] "Long Live Sacred Germany" [...] was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a [...] "three minute drone that I slowed down with these two Tuvan throat singers, the whole thing was this horribly dark, morbid piece [...] left you cold". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster.|$|E

40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing for passively suspending a rotatable element subjected to axial and radial thrust forces is disclosed. The {{magnetic bearing}} employs a taut wire stretched along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} bearing between opposed <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> and an intermediate magnetic section. The intermediate section is segmented to provide oppositely directed magnetic flux paths between the <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> and may include either an axially polarized magnets interposed between the segments. The <b>end</b> <b>pieces,</b> separated from the intermediate section by air gaps, control distribution of magnetic flux between the intermediate section segments. Coaxial alignment of the <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> with the intermediate section minimizes magnetic reluctance in the flux paths endowing the bearing with self-centering characteristics when subjected to radial loads. In an alternative embodiment, pairs of oppositely wound armature coils are concentrically interposed between segments of the intermediate section in concentric arcs adjacent to radially polarized magnets to equip a magnetic bearing as a torsion drive motor. The magnetic suspension bearing disclosed provides long term reliability without maintenance with application to long term space missions such as the VISSR/VAS scanning mirror instrument in the GOES program...|$|R

50|$|Competitor Joshua Harman, a Virginia {{guardrail}} engineer, was whistleblower in {{a federal}} suit which accused Trinity of failing to notify the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of a change of size in the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> from five to four inches.

The lawsuit resulted in a fraud verdict pf $175 million, which would be tripled.|$|E

5000|$|So called 'brushless synchros' use rotary {{transformers}} (that have no magnetic {{interaction with}} the usual rotor and stator) to feed power to the rotor. These transformers have stationary primaries, and rotating secondaries. The secondary is somewhat like a spool wound with magnet wire, the axis of the spool concentric with the rotor's axis. The [...] "spool" [...] is the secondary winding's core, its flanges are the poles, and its coupling does not vary significantly with rotor position.

50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow roll pins, one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed.

40|$|A {{clinostat}} for simulating microgravity on {{cell systems}} {{carried in a}} fiber fixedly mounted in a rotatable culture vessel is disclosed. The clinostat is rotated horizontally along its longitudinal axis to simulate microgravity or vertically as a control response. Cells are injected into the fiber and {{the ends of the}} fiber are sealed and secured to spaced <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> of a fiber holder assembly which consists of the <b>end</b> <b>pieces,</b> a hollow fiber, a culture vessel, and a tension spring with three alignment pins. The tension spring is positioned around the culture vessel with its ends abutting the <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> for alignment of the spring. After the fiber is secured, the spring is decompressed to maintain tension on the fiber while it is being rotated. This assures that the fiber remains aligned along the axis of rotation. The fiber assembly is placed in the culture vessel and culture medium is added. The culture vessel is then inserted into the rotatable portion of the clinostat and subjected to rotate at selected rpms. The internal diameter of the hollow fiber determines the distance the cells are from the axis of rotation...|$|R
