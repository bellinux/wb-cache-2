However, most of the advances in the design of high speed wireless multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems are based on information-theoretic principles that demonstrate how to efficiently transmit signals conforming to Gaussian distribution. Although the Gaussian signal is capacity-achieving, signals conforming to discrete constellations are transmitted in practical communication systems. As a result, this paper is motivated to provide a comprehensive overview on MIMO transmission design with <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> signals. We first summarize the existing fundamental results for MIMO systems with <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> signals. Then, focusing on the basic point-to-point MIMO systems, we examine transmission schemes based on three most important criteria for communication systems: the mutual information driven designs, the mean square error driven designs, and the diversity driven designs. Particularly, a unified framework which designs low complexity transmission schemes applicable to massive MIMO systems in upcoming 5 G wireless networks is provided in the first time. Moreover, adaptive transmission designs which switch among these criteria based on the channel conditions to formulate the best transmission strategy are discussed. Then, we provide a survey of the transmission designs with <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> signals for multiuser MIMO scenarios, including MIMO uplink transmission, MIMO downlink transmission, MIMO interference channel, and MIMO wiretap channel.

5000|$|Discrete {{digital inputs}} and outputs might be {{buffered}} from the microprocessor data bus only by an addressable latch, or might be operated by a specialized input/output IC, such as an Intel 8255 or Motorola 6821 parallel input/output adapter. Later single-chip micrcontrollers have input and output pins available. These input/output circuits usually do not provide enough current to directly operate devices like lamps or motors, so solid-state relays are operated by the microcontroller digital outputs, and inputs are isolated by signal conditioning level-shifting and protection circuits.

50|$|In {{the field}} of Industrial Control Systems, the {{interfacing}} of various control components must provide means to coordinate the signals and commands sent between control modules. While tight coordination is desirable for <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs, {{it is especially important}} in motion controls, where directing the movement of individual axis of motion must be precisely coordinated so that the motion of the entire system follows a desired path. Types of equipment requiring such coordination are, for example, metal cutting machine tools, metal forming equipment, assembly machinery, packaging machinery, robotics, printing machinery and material handling equipment. The Sercos (serial real-time communication system) interface is a globally standardized open digital interface for the communication between industrial controls, motion devices (drives) and input output devices (I/O). Sercos I and II are classified as standards IEC 61491 and EN 61491. Sercos III is specified in standards IEC 61800-7; IEC 61784-1, -2, -3 and IEC 61158. Sercos is designed to provide hard real-time, high performance communications between industrial motion controls and digital servo drives.|$|E

These are much like PLCs, and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O (i.e. a few signals {{coming in from the}} real world and a few going out) are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Popular names include PICO Controller, NANO PLC, and other names implying very small controllers. Most of these have 8 to 12 <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs,</b> 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Size is usually about 4" [...] wide, 3" [...] high, and 3" [...] deep. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two orders of magnitude less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” We {{consider}} a mixed linear system model, with both continuous and <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs, {{described by a}} coefficient matrix {{and a set of}} noise variances. When the <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs are absent, the model reduces to the usual noise-corrupted linear system. With <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> only, the model has been used in fault estimation, and with discrete outputs only, the system reduces to a probit model. We consider two fundamental problems: Estimating the model input, given the model parameters and the model output; and identifying the model parameters, given a training set of input-output pairs. The estimation problem leads to a mixed Boolean-convex optimization problem, which can be solved exactly when the number of discrete variables is small enough. In other cases the estimation problem can be solved approximately, by solving a convex relaxation, rounding, and possibly, carrying out a local optimization step. The identification problem is convex and so can be exactly solved. Adding â„“ 1 regularization to the identification problem allows us to trade off model fit and model parsimony. We illustrate the identification and estimation methods with a numerical example. A. System model I...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{data set}} {{comprised}} {{of public school}} districts in the state of Illinois, we examine the role of traditional inputs" and -schooling inputs" in the determination of test scores. Using recently developed nonparametric kernel methods, we are able to determine the relevance (or irrelevance) of many commonly used inputs in an educational production function. We nd that most commonly used `schooling inputs' (e. g., capital per pupil expenditure) are irrelevant in determining student test scores in our sample, even in a very general setting. For the relevant inputs, our ndings show that heterogeneous returns (which are allowed by our approach) are able to reconcile some of the insignicant or modest impacts of (non-schooling) inputs typically found in the literature. We further extend the existing analysis by developing an eciency estimator which allows for <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs.</b> Previous attempts in the literature have either used partially linear models, treated <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> as continuous, ran separate regressions for each value of the discrete regressor or excluded them altogether. Our estimators (which use discrete kernels to incorporate <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs)</b> of the educational production function and technical eciency scores are consistent under standard assumptions and regularity conditions. In our application, we nd that the standard parametric estimators drastically underestimate the level of eciency. This is not only important from an econometric standpoint, but it may also be important for policy. If we believe that schools are underperforming, we may unnecessarily penalize schools, teachers and/or students. We fail to nd any evidence that school districts facing property tax caps operate more eciently so as to oset the negative eects of lack of resources on students' performance...|$|E

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, {{so called}} OFDM, {{has found a}} {{prominent}} place in various wireless systems and networks {{as a method of}} encoding data over multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM-based communication systems, however, lacking inherent diversity, are capable of benefiting from different spatial diversity schemes. One such scheme, Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD) is a method to provide spatial diversity which can be also interpreted as a Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) step. The main idea is to add more transmit antennas at the transmitter side sending the same streams of data, though with differing time delays. In [1], the capacity of a point-to-point OFDM-based channel with CDD is derived for inputs with Gaussian and discrete constellations. In this dissertation, we use the same approach for an OFDM-based single-input single-output (SISO) two-user interference channel (IC). In our model, at the receiver side, the interference is treated as noise. Moreover, since the channel is time-varying (slow-fading), the Shannon capacity in the strict sense is not well-defined, so the expected value of the instantaneous capacity is calculated instead. Furthermore, the channel coefficients are unknown to the transmitters. Thus, in this setting, the probability of outage emerges as a reasonable performance measure. Adding an extra antenna in the transmitters, the SISO IC turns into an MISO IC, which results in increasing the diversity. Both the continuous and <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> are studied {{and it turns out that}} decoding interference is helpful in some cases. The results of the simulations for <b>discrete</b> <b>inputs</b> indicate that there are improvements in terms of outage capacity compared to the ICs with single-antenna transmitters...|$|E

40|$|Function {{approximation}} {{capabilities of}} feedforward Neural Networks {{have been widely}} investigated {{over the past couple}} of decades. There has been quite a lot of work carried out in order to prove 'Universal Approximation Property' of these Networks. Most of the work in application of Neural Networks for function approximation has concentrated on problems where the input variables are continuous. However, there are many real world examples around us in which input variables constitute only discrete values, or a significant number of these <b>input</b> variables are <b>discrete.</b> Most of the learning algorithms proposed so far do not distinguish between different features of continuous and <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> spaces and treat them in more or less the same way. Due to this reason, corresponding learning algorithms becomes unnecessarily complex and time consuming, especially when dealing with inputs mainly consisting of discrete variables. More recently, it has been shown that by focusing on special features of <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> spaces, more simplified and robust algorithms can be developed. The main objective of this work is to address the function approximation capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks. There is particular emphasis on development, implementation, testing and analysis of new learning algorithms for the Simplified Neural Network approximation scheme for functions defined on <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> spaces. By developing the corresponding learning algorithms, and testing with different benchmarking data sets, it is shown that comparing conventional multilayer neural networks for approximating functions on <b>discrete</b> <b>input</b> spaces, the proposed simplified neural network architecture and algorithms can achieve similar or better approximation accuracy. This is particularly the case when dealing with high dimensional-low sample cases, but with a much simpler architecture and less parameters.

By developing, implementing and testing with empirical data it has been shown that these simplified Neural Network based algorithms also performs well in other Neural Network based ensembles.
