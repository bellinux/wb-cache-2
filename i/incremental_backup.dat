50|$|An <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> of {{the changes}} made between two {{instances}} of a mirror is called a reverse incremental. By applying a reverse incremental to a mirror, {{the result will be}} a previous version of the mirror.In other words, after the initial full backup, each successive <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> applies the changes to the previous full, creating a new synthetic full backup every time, while maintaining the ability to revert to previous versions.The main advantage of this type of backup is a more efficient recovery process, since the most recent version of the data (which is the most frequently restored version) is a (synthetic) full backup, and no incrementals need to be applied to it during its restoration. Reverse <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> works for both tapes and disks, but in practice tends to work better with disks. Companies using the reverse <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> method include Intronis and Zetta.net.|$|E

5000|$|EMC Corporation, {{makers of}} EMC NetWorker (formerly Legato), states that “Incremental is a backup of latest changes {{since the last}} backup (any level) so when a full {{recovery}} is needed {{you would need to}} restore the last full backup plus all the <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> until the point-in-time you want to restore...Differential <b>backups</b> are <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> since the last full backup… the differential backups will always save the differences between the last full.” ...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{important}} to use the terms [...] "differential backup" [...] and [...] "incremental backup" [...] correctly. The two terms are widely used in the industry, and their use is universally standard. A differential backup refers to a backup made to include the differences since the last full backup, while an <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> contains only the changes since the last <b>incremental</b> <b>backup.</b> (Or, of course, since the last full backup if the <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> in questions is the first <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> immediately after the last full backup.) All the major data backup vendors have standardized on these definitions, including Microsoft, Acronis, and Symantec. Microsoft, makers of Backup and Restore, defines incremental backups and differential backups as follows: [...] "Incremental: An <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> provides a backup of files that have changed or are new since the last incremental backup....Differential: A differential backup provides a backup of files that have changed since a full backup was performed. A differential backup typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last full backup, but this can vary in different backup programs. Together, a full backup and a differential backup include all the files on your computer, changed and unchanged." [...] Microsoft products, such as Exchange Server 2010 use this definition in their literature and support sites.|$|E
5000|$|Note: Vendors have {{standardized}} on {{the meaning}} of the terms [...] "incremental backup" [...] and [...] "differential backup". However, there have been cases where conflicting definitions of these terms have been used. The most relevant characteristic of an <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> is which reference point it uses to check for changes. By standard definition, a differential backup copies files that have been created or changed since the last full backup, regardless of whether any other differential backups have been made since then, whereas an <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> copies files that have been created or changed since the most recent backup of any type (full or incremental). Other variations of <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> include multi-level incrementals and incremental backups that compare parts of files instead of just the whole file.|$|E

5000|$|... {{individual}} {{management of}} encrypted files e.g. <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> {{of the individual}} changed files even in encrypted form, rather than backup of the entire encrypted volume ...|$|R
50|$|A related {{program is}} Rocks Strata, a tool written in Go, which allows {{managing}} <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> of MongoDB when RocksDB {{is used as}} the storage engine.|$|R
5000|$|Quest Software, {{makers of}} NetVault Backup, states that “Incremental - An <b>Incremental</b> <b>backup</b> {{transfers}} {{the changes in}} a volume since the last Full, Differential, or <b>Incremental</b> <b>backup.</b> Incremental backups consume minimum storage space and are quicker to perform...Differential - A Differential backup transfers the changes in a volume since the last Full backup. Differential backups speed up recovery since the plug-in is only required to restore two savesets, the Full and the latest Differential backup.” ...|$|E
50|$|An {{unsupported}} free edition {{is available}} for non-commercial use, which lacks some features of full versions e.g. <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> (though it includes differential backup).|$|E
5000|$|Incremental backup: When an <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> is performed, {{only the}} files {{which have been}} {{modified}} since the last backup are stored in your archive.|$|E
50|$|A Synthetic backup is an {{alternative}} method of creating full backups. Instead of reading and backing up data directly from the disk, it will synthesize {{the data from the}} previous full backup (either a regular full backup for the first backup, or the previous synthetic full backup) and the periodic <b>incremental</b> <b>backups.</b> As only the <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> read data from the disk, these are the only files that need to be transferred during Offsite Replication. This greatly reduces the bandwidth needed for Offsite Replication.|$|R
50|$|When {{browsing}} the <b>backups,</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> {{are automatically}} filled {{back to the}} previous full backup. So every backup {{appears to be a}} full and complete set of data.|$|R
50|$|The send/receive feature can be {{used with}} {{regularly}} scheduled snapshots for implementing a simple form of file system master/slave replication, or for the purpose of performing <b>incremental</b> <b>backups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MySQL, {{makers of}} MySQL Enterprise Backup, states that [...] "An <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> only backs up data that {{changed since the}} {{previous}} backup or incremental." ...|$|E
50|$|A Unix example would be: rsync -e ssh -va --link-dest=$dst/hourly.1 $remoteserver:$remotepath $dst/hourly.0The use of rsync's --link-dest {{option is}} what makes this command an example of <b>incremental</b> <b>backup.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> task may use {{the archive}} bit to {{distinguish}} which files have already been backed up, and select only the new or modified files for backup.|$|E
50|$|Another way sneakernets {{are used}} {{together}} with network transfers {{is to provide}} an initial full backup {{as a base for}} <b>incremental</b> <b>backups.</b> In the case of a large (several terabyte) dataset that grows by just a few megabytes a day, the initial seeding of the data to be backed up would require an excessively long time upload over a network. One solution is to make a local copy of the data which is then physically relocated to the remote location and topped up with daily <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> over a network.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, Barracuda Networks {{acquired}} Yosemite Technologies to add software {{agents for}} <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> of {{applications such as}} Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server, and Windows system states.|$|R

50|$|Intronis ECHOplatform {{provides}} cloud backup {{and disaster}} recovery for both on-premises and off-premises for file, folder and system data protection. The company also provides bare metal restore, image backup; and reverse <b>incremental</b> <b>backup.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Update Baseline - An <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> or {{snapshot}} {{is taken}} of monitored files and operating system configurations. Authorized administrators can compare between captured baselines and, in many cases, manually roll-back to prior baselines using stored authoritative files.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{implementation}} of a remote access plugin or module is to incrementally back up files and databases from the web server to the client. Some <b>incremental</b> <b>backup</b> implementations may even offer basic host-based intrusion detection system functionality.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, with 10 employees, {{the company}} {{released}} Veeam Backup & Replication, {{a tool that}} provided VMware vSphere VMs with <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> and image-based replication, with built-in data deduplication and compression. Veeam Backup & Replication started supporting Microsoft Hyper-V in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Streaming backup is {{a backup}} method where copies of all desired {{database}} files and the necessary log files are {{made during the}} backup process. File copies may be saved directly to tape or {{can be made to}} any other storage device. No quiescing of activity of any kind is required with streamed backups. Both the database and log files are check summed to ensure that no data corruptions exist within the data set during the backup process. Streaming backups may also be <b>incremental</b> <b>backups.</b> <b>Incremental</b> <b>backups</b> are ones in which only the log files are copied and which can be restored along with a previous full backup to bring all databases to a recent state.|$|R
5000|$|Refactoring: The {{process of}} rearranging the backup sets in a data {{repository}} {{is known as}} refactoring. For example, if a backup system uses a single tape each day to store the <b>incremental</b> <b>backups</b> for all the protected computers, restoring one of the computers could potentially require many tapes. Refactoring {{could be used to}} consolidate all the backups for a single computer onto a single tape. This is especially useful for backup systems that do <b>incrementals</b> forever style <b>backups.</b>|$|R
