5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E
25|$|Quarter cracks are {{vertical}} splits in a <b>hoof</b> <b>wall,</b> {{most commonly}} {{seen on the}} inside of the front hooves or the outside of the hind hooves. They can result from poor shoeing and management practices, natural hoof conformation, or injuries to the leg and hoof.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{shoes are}} placed in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> at the white line of the hoof. The nails are shaped {{in such a way}} that they bend outward as they are driven in, {{avoiding}} the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the sharp points and uses a clincher (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching block with hammer to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall.</b> This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{research}} by individuals such as Jaime Jackson and Tia Nelson have studied feral horses {{to observe the}} way in which their natural foraging and roaming affects their hooves. They noticed that the hooves of these horses have a different configuration from domestic horses kept in soft pasture, having shorter toes and thicker, stronger <b>hoof</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{viewed from}} the lower surface, the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall's</b> free margin encircles most of the hoof. The {{triangular}} frog occupies the center area. Lateral to the frog are two grooves, deeper in their posterior portion, named 'collateral grooves'. At the heels, the palmar/plantar portion of the walls bend inward sharply, following the external surface of collateral grooves to form the bars. The lower surface of the hoof, from the outer walls and the inner frog and bars, is covered by an exfoliating keratinised material, called the 'sole'.|$|R
5000|$|The case of shoeing is special. It was {{originally}} {{a means of}} protecting the equine foot from {{wear and tear on}} different hard surfaces. However, its usefulness is questioned by a growing number of riders who feel that being [...] "barefoot" [...] is more consistent with the nature of the horse. According to Pierre Enoff, the horse does not really need shoeing, which frustrates locomotion and sensory perception by forcing it to rely solely on the <b>hoof</b> <b>walls,</b> unable to use the soles or assess the terrain. The dominant perspective of professionals in the horse world, including farriers, is to see shoeing as protection for the hoof. Similarly, moving to a barefoot approach too quickly can be harmful to horses that have lived with shoes for a long time if their feet are not prepared.|$|R
25|$|A {{horseshoe}} is a fabricated product, normally made of metal, although sometimes made partially or wholly {{of modern}} synthetic materials, {{designed to protect}} a horse's hoof from wear. Shoes are attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the hooves, usually nailed through the insensitive <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> that is anatomically akin to the human toenail, although much larger and thicker. However, there are also cases where shoes are glued.|$|E
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> {{to the desired}} length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E
25|$|Mistakes are {{sometimes}} made by even a skilled farrier, {{especially if the}} horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming {{too close to the}} sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or nail pricking. This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall and hits the sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of lameness or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These mistakes are made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> is particularly thin (common in Thoroughbreds), or if the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, manufacturing defects in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good <b>hoof</b> <b>walls.</b> They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|R
25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall bedding. In some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle <b>hoof</b> <b>walls</b> are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|R
40|$|Tölt is a {{symmetric}} four-beat gait with a {{speed range}} extending into that of trot and canter. Specific shoeing methods, such as unnaturally high and long hooves, {{are used to}} enforce individual gait predisposition. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the consequences of this shoeing style on loading and movement of the limbs at walk, tölt and trot, and at different velocities. Simultaneous kinetic and kinematic gait analysis was carried out at walk (1. 4 m/s) and at two tölting and trotting speeds (3. 3 m/s and 3. 9 m/s) on an instrumented treadmill. Thirteen sound Icelandic horses were first measured with high, long front hooves (SH) and, one week later, after trimming the hooves according to standard shoeing principles (SN). Comparing SH with SN, front hooves had 21 ± 5 mm longer dorsal <b>hoof</b> <b>walls</b> and the shoeing material per hoof was 273 ± 50 g heavier. In all three gaits, gait quality, as it is currently judged, was improved with SH due to a lower stride rate, a longer stride length and a higher, but not wider, forelimb protraction arc, which were also positively associated with speed. Forelimb-hind limb balance remained unchanged, but limb impulses were higher. Apart from an increase of ⩽ 2. 2 % in the forelimbs at the faster speed of both tölt and trot, SH had little influence on vertical peak forces...|$|R
500|$|The {{critical}} {{importance of the}} feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, [...] "no foot, no horse". The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, {{the equivalent of the}} human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. The end result is that a horse, weighing on average , travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe. For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks, though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.|$|E
2500|$|In farriery, surforms {{are used}} to remove excess <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> from a horse's hoof. [...] They may {{also be used to}} [...] "manicure elephants' hooves".|$|E
2500|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} encases {{the second and third}} phalanx of the lower limbs, {{analogous}} to the fingertip or toe tip of a human. [...] In essence, a horse travels on its [...] "tiptoes". [...] The <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> is a much larger, thicker and stronger version of the human fingernail or toenail, made up of similar materials, primarily keratin, a very strong protein molecule. The horse's hoof contains a high proportion of sulfur-containing amino acids which contribute to its resilience and toughness. Vascular fold-like structures called laminae suspend the distal phalanx from the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} cornified {{structures of}} the <b>hoof</b> are the <b>wall,</b> the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by ground contact, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming {{the walls and the}} frog, and scraping off the dead sole.|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonBeta-adrenergic {{agonists}} (βAA) {{are administered}} {{during the final}} weeks of the beef production system to improve efficiency and increase meat yield. Welfare concerns linked to the administration of βAA have garnered significant attention in recent years due to anecdotal reports of increased mortality during βAA feeding periods and cattle without obvious disease or injury having difficulty walking at abattoirs being overrepresented in cattle fed βAA. Thomson et al. (2015) reported 2 events where cattle were distressed, became non-responsive to handling, sloughed <b>hoof</b> <b>walls</b> and were euthanized while in lairage at the abattoir. Consistent blood abnormalities in euthanized cattle included elevated blood lactate (25. 6 mmol/L; ref. range: < 4 - 5) and creatine kinase (CK; 6, 890 U/L, ref. range: 159 - 332). Although no causal relationship had been established, dialogues among groups of packers, animal scientists, and welfare experts implicating the βAA zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZIL; Zilmax®, Merck Animal Health, Desoto, KS) as one possible etiology resulted in a major beef packer announcing plans to stop accepting cattle fed ZIL. Consequently, Merck announced a self-imposed suspension of ZIL sales in U. S. and Canadian markets until further research could be conducted to investigate the manner. Utilization of technologies such as βAA are imperative to meeting {{the demands of a}} growing world population and verdicts regarding such technologies, including their impact on animal welfare, should be based on scientific merit. The first objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of shade on performance and animal well-being in cattle fed ZIL. The second objective was to characterize the clinical description and hematological profile of fatigued cattle presented to abattoirs. The third objective was to evaluate the effects of handling intensity during shipment for slaughter in cattle fed a βAA. The fourth objective was to evaluate the effects of βAA administration on performance and physiological response to different handling intensities during shipping for slaughter. Shade provision reduced open-mouth breathing and increased dry matter intake and dressing percentage. Fatigued cattle observed at abattoirs had increased respiratory rates and muscle tremors, although blood parameters were relatively normal compared to their cohorts. Metabolic acidosis, a precursor for Fatigued Cattle Syndrome, was observed in cattle exposed to aggressive handling regardless of βAA status. This research confirms the improved growth performance of cattle fed βAA and highlights the improvement of animal welfare through shade provision and low-stress handling in heavy-weight feedlot cattle...|$|R

2500|$|The horse's {{circulatory system}} {{includes}} the four-chambered heart, averaging [...] in weight, {{as well as}} the blood and blood vessels. Its main purpose is to circulate blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and to remove waste from these tissues. The hoof (including the frog - the V shaped part {{on the bottom of the}} horses hoof) is a very important part of the circulatory system. As the horse puts weight onto the hoof, the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> is pushed outwards and the frog compressed, driving blood out of the frog, the digital pad, and the laminae of the hoof. [...] When weight is removed from the hoof, the release of pressure pulls blood back down into the foot again. [...] This effectively creates an auxiliary blood-pumping system at the end of each leg. [...] Some of this effect is lost when a horse is shod (eliminating the expansion and contraction of the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall</b> and raising the frog higher from the ground).|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the term}} [...] "farrier" [...] implies a {{professional}} horseshoer with skill, education, and training. Some people who shoe horses are untrained or unskilled, {{and likely to}} {{do more harm than}} good for the horse. People who do not understand the horse's foot will not trim the hoof correctly. This can cause serious problems for the animal, resulting in chronic lameness and damage to the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall.</b> Poor trimming will usually place the hoof at an incorrect angle, leave the foot laterally unbalanced and may cut too much off certain areas of the <b>hoof</b> <b>wall,</b> or trim too much of the frog or sole. Some horseshoers will rasp the hoof down to fit an improperly shaped or too-small size of shoe, which is damaging to the movement of the horse and can damage the hoof itself if trimmed or rasped too short. A poor horseshoer can also make mistakes in the shoeing process itself, not only quicking a horse, but also putting shoe on crooked, using the wrong type of shoe for the job at hand, shaping the shoe improperly, or setting it on too far forward or back.|$|E

But an old man among the besiegers argued that as long as those within were allowed to continue to perform sacrifices, they could not be defeated. So on the next day, when those inside sent down the basket of money, the besiegers sent up a pig.

40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the physical hoof properties of digits responsible for clinical lameness with those of other digits on the same cows and with those of equivalent digits on non-lame control cows. The control cows were herd-mates matched by age, breed and stage of lactation. Hoof moisture, hoof hardness and sole concavity were measured on-farm. The resilience, compressive strength and elastic modulus of both sole and <b>wall</b> <b>hoof</b> were measured on biopsy samples collected from both case and control digits. White line disease, sole bruising and septic pododermatitis accounted for 92 % of the clinical lameness lesions in the case digits examined. Less severe forms of white line disease and hoof haemorrhage were also observed frequently in the non-lame digits of both the case and control cows. Independent variables were screened for unconditional associations with case-control status using Student's paired t-test and Wilcoxon's matched pairs test. Conditional logistic regression analysis was finally used to identify which risk factors were associated with lameness. When equivalent digits on the matched cows were used as controls, sole and heel moisture, sole hardness, sole concavity and wall colour were selected for inclusion in the model derived to explain differences between the physical properties of lame and control digits. Values for each of these properties were lower in the lame digits than in the controls. The control digits had a higher percentage of black coloration than the lame digits. Sole hardness and sole concavity (both lower in the lame digits) were also selected for inclusion in the conditional logistic regression model derived when the adjoining digits on the same legs of the lame cows were used as controls. None of the physical hoof properties measured were associated with lameness when attempts were made to fit a model using the equivalent digits on the opposite legs of the lame cows as controls. Production of the lame cows was also compared with that of matched herd-mates. Total lactation yields of milk, milk fat and milk protein were lower for the lame cows than for the control cows (P< 0. 05).

50|$|White line disease (also {{known as}} seedy toe) is a fungal {{infection}} of the horse's hoof.
