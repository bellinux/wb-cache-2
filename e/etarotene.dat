40|$|Treatment of SV 40 -transformed keratinocytes (Z 114) with {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} (EGF) resulted {{in an increase in}} ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and a dose-dependent increase in ODC mRNA levels. Pretreatment of keratinocytes with all-trans-retinoic retinoic acid inhibited the EGF induction of ODC activity. In both quiescent and EGF-stimulated cells, all-trans-retinoic acid inhibited ODC gene transcription and lowered ODC mRNA levels, whereas glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase expression remained unaffected. Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid for 24 h resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of up to 52 % in EGF binding to EGF receptors and a 30 - 75 % decrease in EGF-receptor quantity. In addition, when cells were treated with both UV radiation and all-trans-retinoic acid, their effects were additive in causing a decrease in EGF binding. Blocking of EGF receptors with a neutralizing antibody for EGF receptors inhibited the induction of ODC activity by EGF. The effects of several other retinoids, including Ro 15 - 0778, etretinate, Ro 13 - 7410, <b>etarotene,</b> Ro 40 - 8757, 13 -cis-retinoic acid and acitretin, were also studied to determine their effects on EGF binding and ODC activity. Two of these other retinoids, 13 -cis-retinoic acid and Ro 13 - 7410, inhibited EGF binding the most (35 - 46 %, P < 0. 001); several others (<b>etarotene,</b> Ro 40 - 8757 and etretinate) were less effective (7 - 16 %), but significantly decreased EGF binding (P < 0. 05), and two retinoids (Ro 15 - 0778 and acitretin) showed no significant effect on EGF binding. In contrast, all of the retinoids tested inhibited the induction of ODC activity by EGF, although etretinate and Ro 15 - 0778 were less effective. EGF signal transduction is important in ODC gene regulation, and retinoids are significant modulators of this pathway...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that murine and human keratinocytes respond differently to phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Using an in vitro assay, we found that in contrast to its effect on murine skin, PMA did not induce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in human skin biopsies. To explore the signalling induced by PMA and to determine whether an in vitro culture system could be used to predict biological activity of retinoids in human keratinocytes, we studied a simian virus 40 (SV 40) -transformed human keratinocyte cell line. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates ODC activity and increases the steady-state level of ODC mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in these cells [Prystowsky, Clevenger and Zheng (1993) Exp. Dermatol. 2, 125 - 132]. In this report, 10 (- 10) M- 10 (- 7) M PMA induced ODC mRNA and enzyme synthesis at 7 h, but did not significantly induce ODC activity and inhibited the EGF induction of ODC activity. To explore the mechanism whereby PMA interfered with EGF signalling, the effect of PMA on EGF binding to its cell-surface receptor was studied; acute treatment with PMA (within 7 h) decreased EGF binding to 41 - 57 % of the baseline level. In contrast, chronic treatment with PMA (24 h) increased EGF binding to 156 % of the baseline level and was associated with an increase in quantity of EGF receptor protein. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation correlated with the acute decrease in EGF binding following PMA treatment. In summary, PMA induced ODC mRNA and ODC enzyme synthesis, while steady-state levels of immunoprecipitable ODC enzyme protein and ODC activity were not increased, demonstrating possible increased turnover of ODC enzyme protein. Additionally, PMA inhibited the induction of ODC by EGF through decreased EGF binding, possibly mediated by PKC activation. Finally treatment of the keratinocytes with retinoids including etretinate, Ro 13 - 7410, <b>etarotene,</b> Ro 40 - 8757, 13 -cisretinoic acid, and acitretin blocked the PMA induction of ODC mRNA, suggesting this in vitro model could be a valuable screening assay for predicting biological activity in humans...|$|E
