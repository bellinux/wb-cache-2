40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the effect of a live M. synoviae vaccine (Vaxsafe® MS, Bioproperties Pty Ltd, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia) on M. synoviae-induced eggshell apex abnormalities (EAA). Four experimental groups of SPF white laying hens were made. All groups were inoculated with IBV D 1466 at 18 weeks of age. One group did not receive further treatment (non-vaccinated non-challenged (NVNC)). Two groups were vaccinated at 14 weeks of age against M. synoviae and one of these groups was also challenged with an EAA-inducing M. synoviae strain 5 days after IBV challenge (vaccinated non-challenged (VNC) and vaccinated challenged group (VC), respectively). The fourth group was not vaccinated but was challenged with M. synoviae. (non-vaccinated challenged (NVC)). EAA eggs were only produced in the NVC and VC group. However, the proportion of EAA eggs and the mean daily EAA egg production per chicken was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the VC group (88 / 741 (11. 9 %) and 0. 09 ± 0. 01 eggs per hen) compared to the NVC group (148 / 646 (22. 9 %) and 0. 14 ± 0. 01 eggs per hen). The mean daily egg production per chicken was significant lower in the NVC group (0. 48 ± 0. 03 eggs) compared to that of the NVNC group (0. 60 ± 0. 03 eggs), but not significantly different from other groups. The eggshell strength of EAA eggs (22. 8 N) was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than non-affected eggs from the other groups (33. 7 N to 39. 5 N). Furthermore, the eggshell strength of non-affected eggs in the NVC group was significant lower ((P < 0. 05) compared to that of non-affected eggs from the <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (33. 7 versus 41. 2 N), but not different from the other groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Haemophilus somnus in the prepuce of young rams was examined. Of 473 rams entering Record of Performance (ROP) stations at 50 days of age, 43 (9. 1 %) were positive. Average daily gain was {{not affected by}} Haemophilus status, but was influenced by breed of ram. Suffolks were predicted to gain 0. 515 kg daily compared to 0. 427 kg for a group combining all other breeds. Using logistic regression to identify risk factors for individual H. somnus infection, rams in 1989 were 0. 382 {{times as likely to}} be infected as rams in 1988, and Suffolks were 0. 314 times as likely to be infected as the other breeds group, but these factors were not significant at the <b>flock</b> level. <b>Of</b> 80 eligible <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> 22 (27. 5 %) were classified as infected with H. somnus, based on rams submitted to the ROP station. Infected flocks contributed 133 rams, 43 (32. 3 %) of which were positive. There was no association between H. somnus status and lambing percent of the percent of abortions and stillbirths, but there was a statistically significant association with the percent of ewes which failed to lamb. In the model developed, 6 % of the bred ewes in noninfected flocks failed to lamb, compared to a rate of 12 % in infected flocks. These results suggest H. somnus may influence ewe fertility earlier, rather than later in gestation. Purchasing replacement animals and having cattle on the farm were risk factors for Haemophilus infection in the flock. Where replacements had been purchased within the previous year, the risk <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> infection rose 8. 5 times, and on farms having cattle as well as sheep, the risk rose 13. 2 times.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{subject of}} the surah is a specific historic event. The year of Muhammad's birth is identified as 'the Year of the Elephant', when Mecca was attacked by Abraha accompanied by an elephant. Quranic exegetes interpreted that God saved the Meccans from this force by sending a swarm of birds that pelted the invaders with clay stones and destroyed them. The army of Abraha destroyed for attacking the Kaabah is a reminder and an example that Allah can save His house (Al-Ka'bah) by destroying an army of 60,000 with elephants, through a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds. The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the word sijjīl (i.e. Lava stone from Volcanic eruption) in verse 4 has the etymology proposed as Persian sang and gil ('stone' and 'clay'), or Aramaic sgyl ('smooth altar stone').

40|$|According to Chapter 1 oft the GlHV, dated December 3 rd, 1997 feedlots of Poultry {{fattening}} {{are required}} to collect Data from the housing conditions of the animals. Taking these fattening data into consideration during official veterinarian Examinations is designed to getting the best possible Information about the flock. Results of the ante mortem examination are to be examined or explained by its origination, {{to be able to}} determine the general health condition of a herd. This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between fattening periods, control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between fattening periods - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative pathogenic micro-organism. The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{are natural}} hosts of the prion disease, scrapie. They are also {{susceptible}} to experi-mental challenge with various scrapie strains and with {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE), which affects cattle and has been accidentally transmitted {{to a range of}} other spe-cies, including man. Incidence and incubation period of clinical disease in sheep following inoculation is controlled by the PRNP gene, which has different alleles defined on the basis of polymorphisms, particularly at codons 136, 154 and 171, although other codons are associated with survival time, and the exact responses of the sheep may be influenced by other breed-related differences. Here we report the results of a long term single study of experimental scrapie and BSE susceptibility of sheep of Cheviot, Poll Dorset and Suffolk breeds, originating from New Zealand and {{of a wide range of}} susceptible and resistant PRNP genotypes. Responses were compared with those of sheep from a closed Cheviot <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> UK <b>origin</b> (Roslin Cheviot flock).

40|$|The {{distribution}} of 12 endogenous retrovirus loci from 13 White Leghorn <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> diverse geographical <b>origin</b> was examined, using {{a total of}} 508 birds. Only one locus, designated ev- 1, was observed to be almost universally present (506 of 508 birds) and thus predominantly homozygous in this breed of chicken.

To further characterize the commonly occurring ev- 1 viral locus {{and to provide a}} foundation for determining the mechanism by which these 12 endogenous retrovirus loci were generated, a new technique of indirect in situ hybridization was used to localize the chromosomal position of ev- 1. By using a combination of specific probes, the position of ev- 1 was localized to a small region on the long arm of chromosome 1. This research represents oen of the first instances in which a defined segment of nonreiterated DNA coding for a known set of genes has been localized to a specific region on a vertebrate chromosome by in situ hybridization...|$|R

40|$|Lakes Natron and Magadi are {{neighbouring}} small soda localised in the Eastern Rift Valley, between Kenya and Tanzania, and are {{the remnants}} of the Paleolake Orolonga after a split that occurred around 9, 000 years BP. These basins represent a really harsh environment, characterized by a complex geo-morphological structure, which may increase, by habitat fragmentation and isolation, the effects of evolutionary forces (like genetic drift and selection) on the native species and populations. These lakes harbour a small species <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> quite recent <b>origin,</b> the Alcolapia <b>flock,</b> endemic <b>of</b> this region and not found in any other place around the world. This flock is characterized by four different morphotypes: A. alcalicus, A. latilabris, A. ndalalani, endemic of Lake Natron, and A. grahami, found only in the Lake Magadi. With the aim to understand the evolutionary processes that are shaping genetic diversity of this species, we have analysed by means of molecular genetics tools (mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers), 310 specimens of Alcolapia collected from eight populations placed around the Lake Natron and from one population located in the north-east part of Lake Magadi. Phylogenetic analyses based on D-loop sequences of a subset of 69 Alcolapia have shown a monophyletic structure <b>of</b> the <b>flock,</b> as suggested by the more frequent haplotype (2 lat) shared by all the morphotypes and corresponding to the Orolonga haplotype identified in previous studies (Seegers et al, 1999; Wilson et al., 2000 and 2004).
