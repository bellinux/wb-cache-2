50|$|Compared {{to normal}} layout, portal axles enable {{the vehicle to}} gain a higher ground clearance, as both the axle tube and <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> are tucked up higher under the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the gear}} {{reduction}} at the wheel which lessens the torque on all the other drivetrain components, {{the size of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> can be reduced to gain even more ground clearance. Additionally, all drivetrain elements, in particular the transfer gearbox and driveshafts, can be built lighter. This can be of use in lowering the center of gravity for a given ground clearance.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{a smaller}} new three-cylinder version which {{was named the}} Dexta had been {{launched}} {{to compete with the}} success of the Massey Ferguson 35, of which it shared the basic engine, gearbox and <b>differential</b> <b>casings</b> as well as many other parts. Both tractors featured the Perkins A3 engine, with a few differences. The engine was at 144 cubic inches in early Dextas, whereas later machines and all MF 35's had the 152 cid version. The two tractors also had different injector systems and many further differences despite their common platform. The gasoline version of the Dexta basically had the same Standard engine as the Ferguson TEA and FE 35, one difference being that the starter was relocated to the right side on the Dexta. Unlike the Ferguson, the gasoline Dexta had the same gearbox castings as the diesel version.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contain the}} study about {{vibration}} analysis for gearbox casing using {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). The aim {{of this paper is}} to apply ANSYS software to determine the natural frequency of gearbox casing. The objective of the project is to analyze <b>differential</b> gearbox <b>casing</b> of tata indigo cs vehicle for modal and stress analysis. The theoretical modal analysis needs to be validated with experimental results from Fourier frequency transformer (FFT) analysis. The main motivation behind the work is to go for a complete FEA of casing rather than empirical formulae and iterative procedures...|$|R
5000|$|The 504 {{was noted}} for its robust body structure, long {{suspension}} travel, and torque tube drive shaft [...] - [...] enclosed in a rigid tube attached at each end to the gearbox housing and <b>differential</b> <b>casing,</b> relieving drive train torque reactions.

5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|E
50|$|Each {{lower link}} is {{fabricated}} from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} lower link pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>casing.</b> Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{marine riser}} has {{transfer}} dynamic cyclic load {{to the top}} of casing string when deepwater drilling operating. Considering with the nonlinear characteristics of seabed soil, the variable string cross section, and the axial load on the top of string, a dynamic <b>differential</b> equation of <b>casing</b> string below mud line and its numerical solution were established. Results illustrate that, the lateral displacement, the bending moment, and the shear of the casing string are not equal when lateral dynamic cyclic loading achieves amplitude due to the soil hysteresis effect. The diameter and wall thickness of conductor have less affect to string vibration frequency, cannot adjust the string natural frequency by adjusting these parameters. The natural frequency of casing string in sand is bigger than it in clay. The undrained shear strength of soil has great effect on the natural frequency of casing string in clay. The lateral displacement amplitude is highest when the vibration frequency of casing string at its natural frequency...|$|R
40|$|Casing While Drilling {{technology}} {{is one of}} the greatest developments in drilling operations. The Casing While Drilling involved drilling and casing a well simultaneously and hence, overall cost of drilling may be reduced significantly by lessening drilling time and drillstring problems encountered during conventional drilling process. This {{technology is}} highly applicable in depleted reservoir as an alternative to the underbalanced drilling, which requires special equipment. This paper presents the applicability of the concept of Casing While Drilling in context of the Arabian (Middle East) drilling operations. Attempts are made in order to overcome some unscheduled hole problems, such as lost circulation, <b>differential</b> sticking and <b>casing</b> stuck due to tight hole during running casing after drillstring pulled out. This paper also presents simplified method that has been developed to predict the torsional and drag forces subjected to the casing string. Method of evaluating fatigue life of casing string has also been developed using simplified analytical techniques based on prevailing drilling conditions in Arabian fields. Both the static and dynamic cyclic loads as encountered in vertical and deviated wells are considered for the evaluation of fatigue life of casing string used for Casing While Drilling. Valuable guidelines are provided based on field representative case studies in order to minimize the various problems of conventional drilling operation through using the Casing While Drilling approach for Arabian field condition.

40|$|The {{methodology}} of measuring the vibration signal recorded on the casing of wheeled armoured vehicle ROSOMAK driving axis is presented. The study {{was performed on}} a test bench for different transmission conditions. A preliminary analysis of the frequency spectra vibration signals recorded. The test stand allows investigation of the differential axle gears under load similar to load during duty operation. It was possible by using the combustion engine and gearboxes and load transmission by using the dynamometer break. Have been described. Three methods of attaching acceleration sensors to differential gears: using screws, magnetic washers and probe handle. The results of comparisons of measurement results obtained using these methods. Finally, the sensors was mount by using the screw connections. Selected positions and points of temperature and vibration measures were described. Values of characteristic frequencies of differential axle gears vibration by moving the drive torque through these boxes were calculated. The spectra of the vibration signal determined during testing gearboxes were shown. It was state that of amplitude-frequency vibration spectra of signals recorded at selected points of <b>differential</b> axle gears <b>casing</b> are clearly visible characteristic frequencies but the vibration the bridge gear unit bridges distorted by vibration of {{the internal combustion engine}} and gearboxes.

50|$|Excepting {{the case}} of {{vehicles}} with beam axles and vehicles having no suspension, in practice it is normal for inboard brakes to be mounted rigidly {{with respect to the}} body of the vehicle, often to the <b>differential</b> <b>casing.</b> This is done to move the weight of the braking mechanism from being carried by the wheels directly (unsprung weight), to being carried indirectly by the wheels via the suspension (sprung mass). This then necessitates a means of transferring braking torque from the brake mechanism to the wheel, which is capable of operating despite the relative movement between body and wheel. Driven wheels already have shafting (or chains in older vehicles) which serve this purpose so there is no penalty for them, but undriven wheels require a similar mechanism which is then called a brake shaft.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering and the definitive published version is available at [URL] and vibration refinement and energy efficiency are the key drivers in powertrain development. The final drive (the differential) {{is a source of}} vibration concern and also contributes to the powertrain inefficiency. To optimise differential characteristics for the key objectives of refinement and efficiency, detailed models of the gear interactions as well as the support bearing dynamics are required. This study reports the integrated lubricated bearing and gear contacts with an eight-degree-of-freedom dynamic analysis (a tribo-dynamic model). Non-Newtonian shear behaviour of thin lubricantfilm conjunctions is taken into account in the integrated tribo-dynamic analysis, which has not hitherto been reported in the literature. The results show that the transmitted vibration spectra from the system onto the <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> are dominated by the bearing frequencies rather than by those due to the meshing of gears. It is also shown that a sufficiently high bearing preload improves the vibration refinement but can lead to a marginally reduced transmission efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The portal axle is an {{off-road}} technology {{which is}} designed to provide higher ground clearance and increased torque at the wheels. The portal axle is typically mounted on the knuckle of the vehicle, allowing both the axle tubing and <b>differential</b> <b>casing</b> to be mounted higher under the vehicle. The usage of the portal axle system brings about two distinctive drawbacks; compromised ride comfort and increased torsional loadings on the drive shaft. In this study, an experimental test was carried out to determine the torsional strength and failure mode of the portal axle drive shaft. The experimental results were then verified using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Results from both experimental and FEA methods indicate that shaft failure occurs at the gear spline. However, there is a big discrepancy in the torsional stress values, in which the FEA results are significantly higher than the measured experimental values. This is reasonable considering that the shaft simulation analysis is conducted in a static structural manner, in which the flanged side of the shaft is fixed (zero displacement). On the other hand, this study also describes the influence of portal axles on passenger ride comfort. Here, the on road experiment is conducted by placing an accelerometer in the cabin of a portal axle equipped vehicle. The ride comfort experiments are conducted using two vehicles. The first being a normal pickup truck and the second being a pickup truck with the portal axles equipped. Both vehicles are of the same make, model and age. All measurements are performed on normal highways and over regular speed humps. The results from the ride comfort experiment indicate that the use of the portal axles result in significant deterioration of ride comfort. In order to validate the experimental results, a quarter car model representing the portal axle vehicle is simulated using Matlab’s Simulink function. Simulation results also indicate that the use of the portal axles adversely affects the ride comfort. However, when comparing the simulation to the experimental results, there is an 18 % discrepancy in the results. This is primarily attributed {{to the fact that the}} quarter car model does not take into account the suspension bushings, suspension joints and chassis bending (flex) of the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Casing While Drilling (CWD) {{has become}} {{increasingly}} attractive as an alternative drilling technology, which provides a means of reducing operational costs substantially as well as avoiding various drilling related problems. The CWD involves drilling and casing a well simultaneously and hence, overall cost of drilling may be reduced significantly by lessening drilling time and various unexpected drilling problems encountered during the conventional drilling process. This technology is readily applicable, specifically in depleted reservoirs {{as an alternative to}} under-balanced drilling, which requires special equipment. This article presents the applicability of the concept of CWD in the context of drilling wells in Arabian formation. Complexities associated with drilling these formations, such as unscheduled hole problems, lost circulation, <b>differential</b> sticking and <b>casing</b> jamming due to tight-hole whilst running casing after withdrawal of conventional drill-string etc. are identified. It has been revealed that the CWD technology can be useful to overcome most of these complexities. In order to evaluate the adequate size and capacity of a rig for CWD operation, prediction of torque and drag is vital. Accurate prediction of such torque and drag on drilling deviated wells using CWD techniques is a complex task. In this article, however, a simplified method for predicting torque and drag, especially in drilling deviated wells using a casing string, is proposed. Valuable guidelines are provided based on a field sample case study using the proposed method. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|In {{the life}} of a well, the cement sheath not only {{provides}} zonal isolation but also supports casing and increases casing-collapse resistance. Due to the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions, the cement sheath {{plays an important role in}} maintaining wellbore integrity. During the production process in HPHT wells, the pressure <b>differential</b> inside the <b>casing</b> and the surrounding formation is larger than the conventional wells. The stress induced by fluid withdrawal in highly compact reservoirs can cause the cement and the casing failure in these wells. These present a greater challenge to the wellbore integrity than the conventional wells. To have reliable data, extensive experimental work on Class G cement was carried out to measure the principal parameters for mechanical structural calculations. The experiment was also set up to simulate conditions under which cement low-cycle fatigue failure could occur. Zero-based cyclic pressure was applied to the casing in the cement low-cycle fatigue test. Three types of cement (72 -lbm/ft 3, 101 -lbm/ft 3 and 118 -lbm/ft 3) were cured and tested at 300 ?F to study the cement mechanical properties under high-temperature conditions over the long term. The tests included a 1 -year mechanical properties measurement such as compressive strength development; i. e., Young?s modulus and Poisson?s ratio. Finite element methods (FEM) were used to study the casing buckling deformation characteristics of reservoir compaction in some south Texas wells. The 2 D and 3 D FEM models were built to study the effects of mechanical properties and reservoir compaction on HPHT well integrity. As the confining pressure increases, the cement shows more plasticity and can withstand more pressure cycles. The cement with a higher Poisson?s ratio and lower Young?s modulus showed better low-cycle fatigue behavior. Casing collapse resistance is very sensitive to void location, cement Poisson?s ratio, cement Young?s modulus, and pore pressure. Casing eccentricity and voids shape have minor effect on the casing-collapse resistance. Casing shear failure, tension failure, and buckling failure are the most likely failure modes in reservoir compaction. For different casing wall thickness, the critical buckling strain is almost identical. This study presents a better understanding of casing failure and cement failure in HPHT wells. The results of the study will help improve cement and casing design to maintain wellbore integrity that can in turn be expected to extend throughout {{the life of}} the well...|$|R
