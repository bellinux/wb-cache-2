5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was <b>developed</b> <b>during</b> the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, the former {{president}} of the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was <b>developed</b> <b>during</b> the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
