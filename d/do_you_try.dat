6000|$|... "Don't go just yet, dear Constance," [...] she said. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to--shut {{me out of}} your heart? Oh, if {{you knew}} how much--how very much I feel for you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{you first}} {{on board a}} Canadian train and now you find me helping at a Montreal store. Isn't this enough? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to find out where}} I come from?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Q: What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to <b>do?</b> A: I {{tried to}} Fix the hard drive. - Verb phrase as answer {{fragment}} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to run away?" [...] {{said the}} Fortune, when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> glare at me so inhospitably?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You very foolish person," [...] she repeated. [...] "Stop, though. Why {{all this}} mystery? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to keep that}} letter from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} this big hole," [...] Boduoc said, [...] "it {{is the only}} one by which they can come down at present. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> and prevent them from {{enlarging}} any of the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] {{the woman}} remarked, sitting {{up on the}} couch. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to make me so uncomfortable, Hester? Sir Leslie may be very clever, but I am not exactly a fool myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the problem}} {{for a man to}} solve. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> that. Good you {{certainly}} can be, if you look to Him for assistance. Let that come first; and then the greatness, if that be possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, come, Basil; I see you're keeping {{something}} back. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to <b>do</b> {{for those}} people? Did {{you tell them}} where you were stopping?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothin'. There was a trolley {{loose in}} the field," [...] replied Worry. [...] "Can you get up? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to block that {{football}} rusher?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to {{hold your}} mother here in the wilderness, Louis Nelson?" [...] he asked suddenly. [...] "Surely a lad like {{yourself}} cannot hope to make a clearing unaided, and it is but keeping her in great danger of a cruel death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] said Lady Agatha, [...] "how you men argue! I am sure I {{never can}} make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with you. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray {{to give up the}} East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love his playing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to put her}} off in that way--to {{make her}} believe he wasn't intoxicated?" [...] asked Annie, venting her {{postponed}} emotion, which was of disapproval.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, if I {{can only}} save you by running for help!' she cried. 'Oh, I {{would have died}} instead! Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> so hard to deliver me?' And she turned away wildly to run for assistance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{anything}} like that again, I'll make it warm for you. Get a swab and clean the deck up at once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what are}} you doing here?" [...] I asked. [...] "It has been long years since you {{revisited}} Earth, and never before in the trappings of Mars. Lord! but it is good to see you--and not a day older in appearance than when you trotted me on your knee in my babyhood. How do you explain it, John Carter, Warlord of Mars, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to explain it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what, John," [...] said he, [...] "do you choose your day, some day {{early in the}} season, and {{come out on the}} best thing you have, and I'll bring, not the black horse, but my old mare; and then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> and keep near me. If I don't leave you at the back of Godspeed before long, I'll give you the mare and the horse too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Is it not curious, that so vast a {{being as}} the whale {{should see the}} world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.--Why then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to [...] "enlarge" [...] your mind? Subtilize it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to be slippery, Molly. The plain pikestaff is your style, morally speaking--if any {{one knows}} what a pikestaff is. Well, now, listen! You're anxious about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not accidentally, Mr. Bathurst. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> always <b>try</b> to run {{yourself}} down? I {{suppose you}} will say next you {{saved my life}} by an accident." ...|$|R
3000|$|We {{need someone}} to almost oversee us, someone to help us through the process to bounce ideas off of, a {{collaborative}} peer or buddy in the building to work through this and provide feedback, ‘How did it go? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> this year? How was everything changed or modified? How did that process go?’ Really focusing on the process, not the product. That’s the important part (Clara, 3 rd grade teacher) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the words}} {{all came to}} me of {{themselves}} in beautiful flowing Latin, just right, {{as if it was}} anybody but myself doing it, and they ran off my pen in red and blue and gold, and all sorts of colours; and fine branching zig-zagging stars, like what the book described, only stranger, came dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle. I could hardly believe the verses would scan by daylight, but I can't find a mistake. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> them again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, yes, you are. You don’t {{know the}} world enough to judge. You don’t know how wise men can be. Owls are nothing to them. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to look like}} an owl? There are {{thousands}} and thousands of them waiting for me outside the door: the staring, hissing beasts. You don’t know what a relief of mental ease and intimacy you have been to me in the frankness of gestures and speeches and thoughts, sane or insane, that we have been throwing at each other. I have known nothing of this in my life but with you. There had always been some fear, some constraint, lurking in the background behind everybody, everybody—except you, my friend.” ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{more than}} five years, this was all that he {{required}} to do for his support, {{and he had the}} winter and most of the summer at his entire disposal. For six weeks of occupation, a little cooking and a little gentle hygienic gardening, the man, you may say, had as good as stolen his livelihood. Or we must rather allow that he had done far better; for the thief himself is continually and busily occupied; and even one born to inherit a million will have more calls upon his time than Thoreau. Well might he say, [...] "What old people tell you you cannot <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> and find you can." [...] And how surprising is his conclusion: [...] "I am convinced that TO MAINTAIN ONESELF ON THIS EARTH IS NOT A HARDSHIP, BUT A PASTIME, if we will live simply and wisely; AS THE PURSUITS OF SIMPLER NATIONS ARE STILL THE SPORTS OF THE MORE ARTIFICIAL." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Night," [...] {{said the}} burglar; [...] "just when I'm busiest. Say, take down that arm of yours--I guess <b>you</b> won't--Say! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>try</b> Blickerstaff's Blood Builder?" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>try</b> to {{read your}} own face? I do, and I can tell you {{it is not a}} bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if <b>you</b> have never <b>tried</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guert Ten Eyck, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> me thus?" [...] {{demanded the}} fortune-teller, solemnly. [...] "I knew your father, and I knew your mother; I knew your {{ancestors}} in Holland, {{and their children}} in America. Generations on generations have I known your people, {{and you are the}} first that I have seen so ill-clad! Do you suppose, boy, that old Doortje's eyes are getting dim, and that she cannot tell her own nation? I saw you on the river--ha! ha! 't was a pleasant sight--Jack and Moses, too; how they snorted, and how they galloped! Crack--crack--that's the ice--there comes the water!--See, that bridge may hit you on the head! Do you take care of this bird, and do you take care of that--and all will come round with the seasons. Answer me one thing, Guert Ten Eyck, and answer me truly. Know you ever a young man who goes quickly into the bush?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to," [...] said my uncle. [...] "But why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{and hide}} your taste under these mere formalities in frames? Why {{do you always}} say 'I pass' {{in the game of}} decoration? Better a mess of green amateurs and love therewith, than the richest autotypes and dull complacency. Have what you like. There {{is no such thing as}} {{absolute}} beauty. That is the Magna Charta of the world of art. What is beautiful to me is not beautiful to another man, in art as in women. But take care to get the art that fits you. Frankly, that 'Love and Death' suits you, Bagshot, about as much as a purple toga would. Orchardson is in your style. I tell you that the greengrocer who buys an original oil painting for sixteen shillings with frame complete is far nearer artistic salvation than the patron of the popular autotype. Surely you will wake up presently, Bagshot, and wonder what you have been about.|$|E
6000|$|Newman got up {{and walked}} away with a {{crushing}} sense that his cause was lost, and yet with an equal inability to give up fighting. He went to one of the great windows, {{and looked out at the}} stiffly embanked river and the formal gardens which lay beyond it. When he turned round, Madame de Cintre had risen; she stood there silent and passive. [...] "You are not frank," [...] said Newman; [...] "you are not honest. Instead of saying that you are imbecile, you should say that other people are wicked. Your mother and your brother have been false and cruel; they have been so to me, and I am sure they have been so to you. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to shield them? Why do you sacrifice me to them? I'm not false; I'm not cruel. You don't know what you give up; I can tell you that--you don't. They bully you and plot about you; and I--I"--And he paused, holding out his hands. She turned away and began to leave him. [...] "You told me the other day that you were afraid of your mother," [...] he said, following her. [...] "What did you mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please," [...] I answered. [...] "I'm used to it. I haven't eaten for ten days, and, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>trying</b> {{to begin}} to eat again is a confounded nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine he}} meant mother; they {{sometimes}} clash," [...] she said. [...] "You don't know Bernard yet. When <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> will <b>try</b> to make allowances, {{like the rest}} of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have till to-morrow night," [...] said Teddy, firmly, [...] "but no longer. I don't think there's {{any need}} to tell <b>you</b> what'll be <b>done</b> if <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to bother Carrots or me again." ...|$|R
