40|$|For {{optimizing}} wheel {{configuration of}} planetary rover, the effect analysis of straight grousers on motion {{performance of a}} small rigid wheel was conducted in loose sand bin. All tests were done at a free wheel sinkage and 0 to 60 % slip in a single-wheel test bed. By the qualitative analysis and comparisons of tractive and steering performance between smooth wheel and the wheels with different straight grousers, {{the results show that}} the <b>grouser</b> <b>height</b> and slip more significantly influence the motion performance than grouser spacing and thickness. Through applying the evaluation indexes of tractive and steering performance to the experimental results, the preferable grouser parameters for actual applications are 15 ° grouser spacing, 10 mm <b>grouser</b> <b>height</b> and 1. 5 mm grouser thickness; the optimum value of wheel slip is 13 % for the similar sand used in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Grousers, {{sometimes}} called lugs, {{are recognized as}} a way to improve wheel performance and traction, but there have been, to date, no comprehensive guidelines for choosing grouser patterns. This work presents a quantitative expression for determining appropriate grouser spacing for rigid wheels. Past empirical studies have shown that increasing <b>grouser</b> <b>height</b> and number can improve performance, to a point. The newly proposed grouser spacing equation is based on observations that wheels with an inadequate number of grousers induce forward soil flow ahead of the wheel, and thus rolling resistance. The equation relates geometric wheel parameters (wheel radius, <b>grouser</b> <b>height</b> and spacing) and operating parameters (slip and sinkage), and predicts a maximum allowable grouser spacing (or, equivalently, a minimum number of grousers). Experiments with various grouser heights and numbers demonstrate good correspondence to the proposed equation, as increases in number of grousers beyond the predicted minimum number stop improving performance. A grouser spacing equation is particularly useful for designing efficient wheels. The proposed relation includes slip and sinkage, parameters that cannot be assumed constant or known a priori, but this work shows that wheels designed using the proposed equation are robust to changing operating scenarios even if they degrade beyond estimated nominal conditions.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a simulation model {{for studying the}} basic design parameters of a&# 13; special rubber track vehicle with rigid link tracks system on Sepang peat terrain in Malaysia. The&# 13; prototype parameters for a track system, including proper track width, ground contact length, pitch and&# 13; <b>grouser</b> <b>height,</b> idler diameter and location, sprocket diameter and location, road-wheel diameter and&# 13; geometrical arrangement, {{the ratio of the}} road-wheel spacing to track pitch and location of the center of&# 13; gravity to ensure good tractive performance. The vehicle track width significantly affects the vehicle&# 13; external motion resistance. The road-wheel spacing ensures the number of road-wheels and&# 13; significantly affects the vehicle external motion resistance. The vehicle traveling speed affects the&# 13; vehicle engine power requirement and vehicle steerability during turning on peat terrain. The simulated&# 13; performance results such as vehicle average motion resistance coefficient of 6. 8 to 7. 9 %, drawbar pull&# 13; coefficient of 25. 22 to 47 % and the tractive efficiency of 74 to 77 % for the vehicle slippage of 5 to&# 13; 20 % and indicate that the vehicle can meet the peat terrain field requirement with its optimal power&# 13; consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although {{there exists}} a lot of {{information}} about soil parameter identification in literature, currently there is no algorithm both making use of state of the art identification methodologies and incorporating statistical analysis. In this paper a state of the art soil parameter identification method is presented including the calculation of their standard deviations and a proper weighting of the objective function. With this algorithm and a Bevameter with advanced sensor and actuator technology a test campaign is started to find a reliable soil preparation which is applicable to a large planetary rover performance testbed. Furthermore the preparation method has to be valid and stable for various types of granular soils, typically used for planetary rover testing in space robotics, since the result of pre-tests show that the soil parameters are highly depending on the preparation. Besides the preparation soil parameters are influenced by different Bevameter test setup variables, too. Thus the effect of the penetration velocity as well as the penetration tool geometry for pressure-sinkage tests on soil parameters is investigated. For shear tests the influence of the dimension of the shear ring is also analysed as the variation of the <b>grouser</b> <b>height,</b> the number of the grousers and the increase of the rotational shear velocity. The results of the extensive test campaign are evaluated by the proposed identification algorithms...|$|E
