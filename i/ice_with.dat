5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

5|$|After being spotted, the German {{ships in}} Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and {{prepared}} for an Allied attack. Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within {{the outer edge of}} the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is the largest of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1923 Lethbridge {{was part}} of a second {{expedition}} led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of Greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat Edward Sabine's pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from Newcastle, they stopped first at Bergen and then Jan Meyen before getting stuck in pack <b>ice.</b> <b>With</b> food reserves running low, the crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.|$|E
5|$|Metis has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, {{which makes it}} the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. It is probably made of a mixture of water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> the dark material similar to that found in the rings. This dark material is probably made of rocks or radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{average density}} of Callisto, 1.83g/cm3, {{suggests}} a composition of approximately equal parts of rocky material and water <b>ice,</b> <b>with</b> some additional volatile ices such as ammonia. The mass fraction of ices is 49–55%. The exact composition of Callisto's rock component is not known, but is probably {{close to the}} composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 0.9–1.3 in Callisto, whereas the solar ratio is around 1:8.|$|E

5|$|The {{second largest}} of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within {{the outer edge of}} the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface. It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable to the size of the moon itself.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel is a moon of Uranus {{discovered}} on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell. It was discovered {{at the same}} time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water <b>ice</b> (<b>with</b> CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> the addition of some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs as {{the seventh}} seed, the Canucks {{went on a}} run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the seventh game of the opening round series against the Calgary Flames, Bure scored {{one of the most}} {{significant}} and well-known goals in Canucks' history. After receiving a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown, he deked and scored on Flames' goalie Mike Vernon in the second overtime to win the series. In game two of the second round against the Dallas Stars, Bure knocked enforcer Shane Churla to the <b>ice</b> <b>with</b> an elbow to the jaw. He also scored two goals in the game to help Vancouver to a 3–0 win. Although Bure was not initially penalized for the play, he was later fined $500 by the league. He recorded six goals and eight points in five games against the Dallas Stars, and against the Toronto Maple Leafs the following round scored four goals and six points in five games.|$|E
