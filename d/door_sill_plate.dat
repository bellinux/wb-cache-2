40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, extensive field investigations revealed damage in wood frame construction in the form of splitting of the 2 X 4 or 2 X 6 wood <b>sill</b> <b>plates</b> along the line of anchor bolts that typically connect shear walls to the masonry or concrete foundation. Due to the severity of such brittle failures, the city of Los Angeles has recently restricted the use of 2 X dimension lumber in <b>sill</b> <b>plates</b> and requires the use of 3 X dimension lumber. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the performance of 2 X dimension lumber <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> connections at the yield and ultimate limit states during incremental quasi-static reversed cyclic loading and suggests possible cost-effective retrofit strategies for their improved seismic performance without having to increase the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> thickness. Proposed retrofit strategies are based on providing confinement to the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> using metal reinforcing straps and reinforcing clamps to increase the deformation capability and energy dissipation capacity of the connection, while maintaining substantial levels of connection strengths...|$|R

Above the foundation and <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the <b>sill</b> <b>plates</b> and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete.

40|$|This study {{relates to}} the topic of {{anchorage}} of shear walls. At times, eccentric forces between the sheathing and the anchoring devices may be introduced in the <b>sill</b> <b>plate.</b> In severe cases, such forces may cause the <b>sill</b> <b>plate</b> to split and to fail in a brittle manner. In this study, fracture mechanics are applied to develop a simple closed-form hand-calculation expression for estimation of the ultimate load capacity of the <b>sill</b> <b>plate.</b> Finite-element analyses using both linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory and a nonlinear fictitious crack model are also used to predict the ultimate load-bearing capacity of the <b>sill</b> <b>plate.</b> The hand-calculation model is compared with the finite-element models, and good agreement is obtained. The results obtained with the various fracture mechanics models are compared with results available from previously performed experimental tests, and again good agreement is obtained. A general conclusion is that the LEFM theory is an adequate approach for the case studied and that the hand-calculation expression developed could be useful for structural design. </p...|$|R
