5|$|Returning {{home with}} Kaminsky, Incanto invites her inside, but quickly retracts his {{invitation}} {{when he sees}} the lights on <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment.</b> After leaving Kaminsky, Incanto finds and kills Monica <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> after she discovers Cross' body in his bathtub. When Jessie asks Incanto about her mother's whereabouts, he denies seeing her. However, Jessie smells her mother's perfume in Incanto's apartment and calls the police. When they arrive, Incanto is gone, but his computer gives a list of women he has been in contact with.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment,</b> he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E

5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for housekeeping and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In {{the course of that}} housekeeping, in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same housekeeping session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a tape recorder <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment,</b> taking the tapes into the studio later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled Little Pieces, is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, Little Pieces won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E

50|$|Chapelain refused many honours, and his disinterestedness {{makes it}} {{necessary}} to receive with caution the stories of Gilles Ménage and Tallemant des Réaux, who claimed that he became a miser, and that a considerable fortune was found hoarded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartments</b> when he died.|$|R
5|$|In mid-May, {{three of}} Bundy's Washington State DES coworkers, {{including}} Carole Ann Boone, {{visited him in}} Salt Lake City and stayed for a week <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment.</b> Bundy subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer {{made no mention of}} her multiple discussions with the King County Police and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews or Sharon Auer.|$|E
5|$|Liz {{is worried}} when she smells maple syrup in her {{apartment}} and Jack tells her {{that it could be}} the chemical agent Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> and she has seen him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for The Amazing Race and, in fact, not terrorists.|$|E
5|$|On the day Jackson {{began the}} third leg of his tour, {{news of the}} {{allegations}} broke {{to the public and}} received worldwide media attention. Jackson ultimately cancelled the remainder of the tour due to health problems arising from the scandal. In January 1994 Jackson reached a financial settlement for $23,000,000 with the Chandlers to resolve the matter and in September a criminal investigation was closed. On November 5, 2009, Chandler committed suicide <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> in Jersey City, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was recorded by the students themselves. In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew from continuing to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment).</b> Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his apartment. Evidence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> {{points to the}} {{construction}} of a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a utility knife to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{wanting to}} contact {{his parents in}} the United States, Owumi {{was not able to}} access the Internet or use his phone for {{international}} calls. He was also without electricity and had little food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment.</b> Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor.|$|E
5|$|Green was {{released}} from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she had nowhere to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment,</b> but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E
50|$|In May 1906, he {{traveled}} to Europe trying to improve his health. However, he got rather worse, and soon returned.

5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, {{whom he had}} been aiding with {{financial}} handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia {{may have played a}} part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, he {{secretly}} {{met with}} the president of Knin County, David Sinčić, with whom he discussed the poor state of the German war-effort and that the Allies may invade the Balkans via Taranto. That month, he launched an initiative to renew negotiations with the HSS, which he conducted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment.</b> There, he secretly met with Sinčić, August Košutić and Ivanko Farolfi. Lorković also sought foreign contacts and through Switzerland made contact with British and American officials, but was rebuffed. He proposed that the NDH end its relations with Germany and join the Allies, a proposal supported by the Minister of the Armed Forces, Ante Vokić, as well as many high-ranking Croatian Home Guard officers and politicians. Lorković also negotiatied with the HSS about switching sides with Pavelić's knowledge and consent.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>apartment</b> for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
