5000|$|Voluntary vs. In{{voluntary}}. In {{a voluntary}} bailment, the bailee agrees {{to accept responsibility}} for possession of the goods. In an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bailment,</b> the bailee has possession of the goods without intent to do so. A common situation that creates voluntary bailment is when a person leaves goods with someone for service (e.g., dry cleaning, pet grooming, car tune-up). The bailee must hold the goods safe for the bailor to reclaim within a reasonable time. An involuntary (or constructive) bailment occurs when a person comes into possession of property accidentally or mistakenly, as where a lost purse or car keys are found and need to be protected until properly redelivered - a bailment is implied by law.|$|E
5000|$|Fixed term vs. {{indefinite}} term. A bailor {{who leaves}} property for a fixed term may be deemed to have abandoned the property {{if it is}} not removed {{at the end of the}} term, or it may convert to an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bailment</b> for a reasonable time (e.g., abandoned property in a bank safe, eventually escheats to the state, and the treasurer may hold it for some period, awaiting the owner). However, if there is no clear term of bailment agreed upon, the goods cannot be considered abandoned unless the bailee is given notice that the bailor wishes to give up possession of the goods. Frequently, in the case of storage of goods, the bailee also acquires a contractual or statutory right to dispose of the goods to satisfy overdue rent; a lawful conversion of bailed goods.|$|E
50|$|The old {{common law}} held a bailee {{strictly}} {{liable for the}} bailment. The exception to this rule {{was the case of}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>bailments</b> (see below), when the bailee is only held to a standard of due care.|$|R
