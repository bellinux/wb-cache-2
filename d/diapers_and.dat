5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
5|$|Four Canadian Navy ships {{headed to}} the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{carrying}} relief supplies {{to help in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia. The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an icebreaker, and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Crews, anticipating potentially rough seas and gusty winds even with the averted course, secured onboard supplies such as generators, chainsaws, <b>diapers,</b> <b>and</b> cots. The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September5, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a short call from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Diapers</b> <b>and</b> diaperlike {{products}} are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often {{due to the}} animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.|$|E

25|$|Parents {{and family}} members are {{frequently}} stressed by a child's bedwetting. Soiled linens and clothing cause additional laundry. Wetting episodes can cause lost sleep if the child wakes and/or cries, waking the parents. A European study estimated that a family with a child who wets nightly will pay about $1,000 a year for additional laundry, extra sheets, disposable absorbent garments such as <b>diapers,</b> <b>and</b> mattress replacement.|$|E
25|$|As {{the years}} went by, Shermy, Patty, and Violet {{appeared}} less often and were demoted to supporting roles (eventually disappearing from the strip in 1969, 1976, and 1984 respectively, although Patty and Violet were still seen as late as November 27, 1997), while new major characters were introduced. Schroeder, Lucy van Pelt, and her brother Linus debuted as very young children—with Schroeder and Linus both in <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> pre-verbal. Snoopy also started to verbalize his thoughts via thought bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Noticing their {{attachment}} to the soft cloth of their <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> the psychological changes that correlated with {{the absence of a}} maternal figure, Harlow sought to investigate the mother–infant bond. This relationship was under constant scrutiny in the early twentieth century, as B. F. Skinner and the behaviorists took on John Bowlby in a discussion of the mother's importance {{in the development of the}} child, the nature of their relationship, and the impact of physical contact between mother and child.|$|E

5000|$|Contours - Contoured diapers {{are much}} like a shaped diaper or prefold except they are cut and sewn into a general {{hourglass}} shape. This is done so that no folding is required before {{they are ready to}} be used as a <b>diaper</b> <b>and</b> also to reduce bulkiness.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also called}} rice lily, {{northern}} rice-root, or (misleadingly) [...] "Indian rice" [...] or [...] "wild rice", {{because of the}} rice-like bulblets that form around its roots. It is also sometimes known as skunk lily, dirty <b>diaper</b> <b>and</b> outhouse lily because of the flower's unpleasant smell.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{disposable}} baby <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> incontinence {{products have}} a layered construction, {{which allows the}} transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.|$|E
25|$|Back zipper : Although back closings using buttons {{were common}} on {{sleepers}} {{made before the}} 1950s, zippers in the back are uncommon in regular children's sleepers. A back zipper may {{make it difficult for}} the wearer to remove the sleeper for bathroom use. Most examples in regular sleepers date from the 1950-1970s as back zippers became less prevalent in the 1980s. Today, back zippers can most commonly be found on sleepers for wearers where it is advantageous to prevent the wearer removing their sleeper, especially those who wear <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> have a tendency to remove them.|$|E
25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
5000|$|My Baby Alive: a doll who is fed {{powdered}} doll food {{mixed with}} water and water from her bottle. She makes a belching sound, wets <b>and</b> messes her <b>diaper,</b> <b>and</b> then asks [...] "Did I make a stinky?". She comes in numerous skin, eye and hair colors.|$|R
50|$|The five-story {{structure}} {{features an}} irregular plan with a ziggurat-like main façade. The rooftop loggia rises above squared bays. The exterior {{is a series}} of repetitive bays covered in golden buff colored brick. The building also features limestone and patterned brick with chevron, <b>diaper</b> <b>and</b> oak leaf motifs.|$|R
5000|$|For {{infants and}} toddlers, less {{frequent}} diaper changes {{can lead to}} increased instances of <b>diaper</b> rash <b>and</b> urinary tract infections, which can hospitalize the baby. When parents cannot afford diapers, they resort to leaving their child in a diaper for much longer than they should. Some parents will leave their child in a wet or dirty <b>diaper,</b> <b>and</b> other parents will “clean” a used disposable <b>diaper</b> <b>and</b> then put in on their baby many different times. Some parents also attempt to potty train their baby as young as {{less than one year}} old, whereas most children are not and should not be potty trained until they are two or even three. [...] Furthermore, the experience of diapering has been identified as a significant conduit for mother-infant bonding and a source of confidence for mothers. Parents' inability to provide adequate diaper changes has been linked to parenting stress and maternal depression. In households where parents experience high levels of stress and depression, children are at greater risk of social, emotional and behavioral problems.|$|R
25|$|Wool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were {{sometimes}} used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful {{because they thought}} the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{is now a}} {{principal}} part of the clinical pathway for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and has been proven to be integral to uninfected siblings' perinatal and neonatal development. Without AZT, as many as 10 to 15% of fetuses with HIV-infected mothers will themselves become infected. AZT {{has been shown to}} reduce this risk to as little as 8% when given in a three-part regimen post-conception, delivery, and six weeks post-delivery. Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable <b>diapers,</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%.|$|E
25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the microporous film used in <b>diapers</b> <b>and</b> some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E
