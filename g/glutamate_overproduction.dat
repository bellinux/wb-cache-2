40|$|Abstract Background Corynebacterium glutamicum {{has several}} anaplerotic {{pathways}} (anaplerosis), which {{are essential for}} the productions of amino acids, such as lysine and glutamate. It is still not clear how flux changes in anaplerotic pathways happen when glutamate production is induced by triggers, such as biotin depletion {{and the addition of}} the detergent material, Tween 40. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed which anaplerotic pathway flux most markedly changes the <b>glutamate</b> <b>overproduction</b> induced by Tween 40 addition. Results We performed a metabolic flux analysis (MFA) with [1 - 13 C]- and [U- 13 C]-labeled glucose in the glutamate production phase of C. glutamicum, based on the analysis of the time courses of 13 C incorporation into proteinogenic amino acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The flux from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate (Oxa) catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) was active in the growth phase not producing glutamate, whereas that from pyruvate to Oxa catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (Pc) was inactive. In the <b>glutamate</b> <b>overproduction</b> phase induced by the addition of the detergent material Tween 40, the reaction catalyzed by Pc also became active in addition to the reaction catalyzed by PEPc. Conclusion It was clarified by a quantitative 13 C MFA that the reaction catalyzed by Pc is most markedly increased, whereas other fluxes of PEPc and PEPck remain constant in the <b>glutamate</b> <b>overproduction</b> induced by Tween 40. This result is consistent with the previous results obtained in a comparative study on the glutamate productions of genetically recombinant Pc- and PEPc-overexpressing strains. The importance of a specific reaction in an anaplerotic pathway was elucidated at a metabolic level by MFA. </p...|$|E
40|$|Global {{regulatory}} {{networks are}} essential for the adaptation to changing environmental conditions and allow bacteria to survive conditions of stress and starvation. Nitrogen control {{is one of these}} networks. It regulates the uptake and assimilation of nitrogen containing compounds in dependence on their availability. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive soil bacterium of important biotechnological relevance, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) seems to play an important but so far less investigated role in nitrogen control. In this work, the regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase and its impact on nitrogen control in C. glutamicum were investigated. Transcription of gdh is induced under nitrogen limitation. By DNA affinity purification with magnetic beads, four transcriptional regulators were isolated, which bind specifically to a fragment of the gdh promoter region that is responsible for the nitrogen-dependent transcription control. These are the putative transcriptional regulators FarR, WhiH, and OxyR, and the well-characterized transcriptional regulator AmtR, which is a major player of nitrogen control C. glutamicum. The exact binding sites of AmtR and FarR were mapped and a principle capacity of FarR to repress gdh-promoter-driven transcription was demonstrated. Surprisingly, neither single deletions nor a quadruple deletion of amtR, farR, whiH, and oxyR in C. glutamicum have any effect on nitrogen-dependent transcription of gdh. Consequently, these regulators are not essential for the nitrogen-dependent regulation of gdh transcription. Nevertheless, they might regulate gdh transcription in response to other stress conditions. A broad range of stress conditions were identified that influence gdh transcription. In addition, a putative role of FarR in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and/or <b>glutamate</b> <b>overproduction</b> was revealed. In the second part of this work, the role of GDH in nitrogen control of C. glutamicum was investigated. A deletion of gdh results in a deregulation of the nitrogen control network. It was demonstrated, that this effect is caused by the loss of GDH activity and not by the absence of the GDH protein itself. In the gdh deletion strain, internal 2 -oxoglutarate is accumulated. A high 2 -oxoglutarate pool seems to antagonize the nitrogen status and triggers a nitrogen starvation-like response even under nitrogen surplus. In addition, ammonium could be identified as a second metabolite that influences nitrogen control in C. glutamicum. In the third part of this work, it was demonstrated that ammonium is not toxic for C. glutamicum and the formation of a putative futile cycle of ammonium was not observed...|$|E
