In the areas {{away from the}} stream one-seeded juniper (Juniperus monosperma), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis) and netleaf {{hackberry}} (Celtis reticulata) are found. Shrubs of the park include four-wind saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata. Wild grapes (Vitis arizonica) and western poison ivy (Toxicodendron rydbergii) {{can be found in}} the cool and wetter parts of Dog Canyon. A variety of cacti species {{can be found in the}} park including strawberry hedgehog (Echinocereus fendleri), cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and numerous prickly pears (Opuntia spp.). Aquatic plants like cattail (Typha angustifolia), <b>giant</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis gigantea) and maidenhair fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris) are sustained by the stream that flows through the canyon.

50|$|Epipactis gigantea is {{a species}} of orchid known by the common names stream orchid and <b>giant</b> <b>helleborine</b> and chatterbox. This wildflower is native to western North America from British Columbia to central Mexico. This {{is one of the}} most {{abundant}} orchids of the Pacific coast of North America.|$|E
50|$|The species {{occur in}} {{temperate}} and subtropical climates of America, Asia, and Europe. These orchids grow in open spaces in forests, in undergrowth, on calcareous soils {{and are often}} found in wet dune-slacks near the sea. The only original American species is <b>Giant</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Epipactis gigantea). One species from Europe, Broad-leaved Helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), is invasive in North America. Most species are protected.|$|E
50|$|Fog drip {{may play}} a key role in the {{precipitation}} in the upper watershed. On Cahill Ridge (just west of San Mateo Creek and east of Pilarcitos Creek, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 feet tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most precipitation and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 inches of precipitation, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7-17 inches of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids <b>Giant</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis gigantea) and Phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.|$|E

50|$|In 1877 {{she married}} again, to Elmer A. Thayer of Massachusetts, {{who was a}} manager for hotels on the Denver and Rio Grande lines. They moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she {{continued}} {{her career as a}} painter. With Thayer, she had two more children, both of whom died rather young (before 1899). In 1882, they moved to Colorado, where she shifted from figure painting to botanical art, focusing on wild flowers native to America depicted in natural settings. Her first book was Wild Flowers of Colorado (1885), illustrated with 24 chromolithographs of her watercolors accompanying a description of her travels throughout the state. It was followed two years later by Wild Flowers of the Pacific Coast, which was similarly framed around a travel narrative. The flowers in both books are painted in a lively, impressionistic style without great attention to scientific detail. Part of the appeal of Thayer's books stemmed from the first-person, diaristic style she used to recount her camping trips and mild adventures in pursuit of unusual flowers in sometimes rugged terrain. In her book on Colorado wild flowers, Thayer {{was the first person to}} report that <b>giant</b> <b>helleborine</b> can be found in that state.|$|E
5000|$|In California Coast Ranges, {{a single}} Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) can [...] "douse {{the ground beneath}} it with the {{equivalent}} of a drenching rainstorm and the drops off redwoods can provide as much as half the moisture coming into a forest over a year". Dawson reported that in a study of northern California redwood forests, 34% of annual hydrologic input was from fog drip. In areas were trees had been cut down, the average annual input from fog was only 17%, proving that the redwoods were required for the fog moisture input to the ecosystem. In an Occidental, California study beneath a single 200 ft Douglas fir on a ridge dividing the moister western slope of the California Coast Range from the drier eastern slope, moisture collected under the tree averaged 58 in versus 27 in in an adjacent open meadow. On Inverness Ridge in Point Reyes National Seashore fog drip from Douglas firs in summer may add 20 in to the otherwise 40 in of annual average rainfall. Further south, on Cahill Ridge on the San Francisco Peninsula (between Pilarcitos Creek and Crystal Springs Reservoir) at an altitude of 1000 ft, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 ft tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most moisture and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 in of moisture, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7 - 17 in of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids <b>Giant</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis gigantea) and Phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.|$|E
