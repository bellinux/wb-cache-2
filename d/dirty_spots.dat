50|$|Roomba is {{a series}} of {{autonomous}} robotic vacuum cleaners sold by iRobot. Introduced in September 2002, Roomba features a set of basic sensors that enable it to perform its tasks. For instance, the Roomba is able to change direction upon encountering obstacles, to detect <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> on the floor, and to sense steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. It uses two independently operating wheels that allow 360° turns in place. Additionally, it can adapt to perform other, more creative tasks, using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.|$|E
50|$|The Roomba 980 was {{released}} in September 2015, and contains a new visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) navigation system, which allows it to clean an entire level of a home more efficiently. The 980 also features Wi-Fi connectivity and an iPhone and Android app. As of March 29, 2017, 900 series users can receive detailed cleaning maps of their Roomba through the app. The maps show exact areas of clean and <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> in the home, allowing the Roomba to know where it needs {{to spend more time}} cleaning. Push notifications of when the Roomba is finished cleaning is also a new feature. Integration to Amazon’s Alexa was also announced, launching in spring 2017.|$|E
5000|$|The Roomba {{is powered}} by a {{removable}} NiMH battery, which must be recharged regularly from a wall power adapter. Newer second- and third-generation models have a self-charging homebase that the unit seeks {{out at the end of}} a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging on the homebase takes about three hours. Four infrared [...] "cliff sensors" [...] on the bottom of the Roomba prevent it from falling off ledges such as stairways. Most second- and third-generation models have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes. Many second- and third-generation Roombas come packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to [...] "drive" [...] the robot to areas to be specially cleaned.|$|E

30|$|This {{hybrid model}} is {{different}} from the model proposed in [21 – 24], which regards scratch as multiplicative noise. This change is based on both physical and chemical causes of scratch. Scratch results from the shedding of coats on the film. As long as the contact surface between the projector and the film is not clean, scratches will appear in the film during displaying. We can model the phenomenon as an additive process, i.e. the film coat becomes thinner damaged by those foreign matters. On the other hand, blotch artifacts can be caused by mildews, <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> or the shedding of film coats. The spatial and temporal discontinuity of blotch makes it suitable to be modeled with the multiplicative noise model. The hybrid model guides us restore them by different methods.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{notion of}} nation is quite recent. It is {{intertwined}} {{with that of}} equal citizenship and nationality, {{the aim of the}} state is to uniform those who are going to become its citizens, under a homogenous state design. But it is this process of state uniformity that is flawed: state’s mechanisms of categorization result from a process of inclusion and exclusion—majority and minority—that cannot help but create marginalization. For this reason, gypsies, vagrants, nomads and pastoralists (Berbers and Bedouins) become national minorities to be controlled under the majoritarian power of the state. Because “all majoritarianisms have in them the seeds of genocide” (Appadurai 2006 : 57), states tend to pursue a policy of ethnic cleansing in order to eliminate the <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> from their national purity. On the basis of this consideration, the case of the Palestinian Arab Bedouin {{is an example of how}} the state can control, suffocate and cleanse its own national minorities and ethnic groups...|$|E

40|$|The {{advances}} of technologies for mobile robotics enable {{the application of}} robots to increasingly complex tasks. Cleaning office buildings {{on a daily basis}} is a problem that could be partially automatized with a cleaning robot that assists the cleaning professional yielding a higher cleaning capacity. A typical task in this domain is the selective cleaning, that is a focused cleaning effort to <b>dirty</b> <b>spots,</b> which speeds up the overall cleaning procedure significantly. To enable a robotic cleaner to accomplish this task, it is first necessary to distinguish dirty areas from the clean remainder. This paper discusses a vision-based dirt detection system for mobile cleaning robots that can be applied to any surface and dirt without previous training, that is fast enough to be executed on a mobile robot and which achieves high dirt recognition rates of 90 % at an acceptable false positive rate of 45 %. The paper also introduces a large database of real scenes which was used for the evaluation and is publicly available...|$|E

40|$|Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is {{a chronic}} {{debilitating}} inflammatory disease, affecting very sensitive areas, such as genitalia, axillae, and groins ofmostly young people, {{with a female}} predilection. Signs and symptoms are devastating for patients’ quality of life, joined {{with a history of}} diagnostic delay, and hidden sufferance even to close relatives. The disease has gained an increasing interest, with the proposal of new efficacious medical treatment. Besides, cosmetic skin care is somewhat uncover. To challenge patients’ own perspective, the proposal of a survey to the main Italian Association, named Inversa Onlus, pointed out a free access question naire, published on the website. One hundred fifteen patients listed the major causes of daily activities limitation from a cosmetic point of view, selecting six items: affected skin appearance; scars appearance; smell; perspiration; epilation; blemish dresses. A 5 points scale expressed the level of disturbance, and the most rated features resulted: skin overall appearance, followed by scars, <b>dirty</b> <b>spots</b> on dress and problems related to depilation, while lesions smell and perspiration problems were judged less important. Asking patients unveiled that physicians should also take care of main accessory, cosmetically oriented daily needs, suggesting dedicated lines of products to improve skin appearance, and social acceptability...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} was dark, overcast, smoky, damp-the soft, unwholesome {{dampness}} that follows a spell of hard frost. I spent the morning and afternoon on the gloomy third floor of Breck and Company, making {{a list of the}} stock. I remember the place as though I had just stepped out of it, the freight elevator at the back, the dusty, iron columns, the continuous piles of cases and bags and barrels with narrow aisles between them; the <b>dirty</b> windows, <b>spotted</b> and soot-streaked, that looked down on Second Street. I was determined now to escape from all this, and I had my plan in mind.|$|R

60|$|We {{should learn}} thirty-seven or thirty-nine things, I am {{not exactly sure}} which: but one thing, at least, we may learn, and that is this--when we see efts in the pond, never to throw stones at them, or catch them with crooked pins, or put them into vivariums with {{sticklebacks}}, that the sticklebacks may prick them in their poor little stomachs, and make them {{jump out of the}} glass into somebody's work-box, and so come to a bad end. For these efts are nothing else but the water-babies who are stupid and dirty, and will not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean; and, therefore (as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years hence, though they are not learned enough to tell you now), their skulls grow flat, their jaws grow out, and their brains grow small, and their tails grow long, and they lose all their ribs (which I am sure you would not like to do), and their skins grow <b>dirty</b> and <b>spotted,</b> and they never get into the clear rivers, much less into the great wide sea, but hang about in dirty ponds, and live in the mud, and eat worms, as they deserve to do.|$|R
50|$|On May 26, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan {{performed}} at the Melkweg in Amsterdam {{as part of the}} Wu-Tang Forever promo tour. As the concert came to an end Wu-Tang Clan members Ol' Dirty Bastard and Method Man announced a freestyle session for local talent. Cilvaringz rushed to the stage but could not reach it due to the excitement of many fans. Ol' <b>Dirty</b> Bastard <b>spotted</b> Cilvaringz struggling from the side and pulled him up on stage, giving him his microphone. Capturing the attention of the entire group and crowd with his freestyle, he was pulled to the side by Method Man and Ol' Dirty Bastard and then introduced to RZA who was watching the freestyle {{from the side of the}} stage. When a fight broke out between the Wu-Tang Clan and a group of fans whose girlfriends were getting undressed by Ol' Dirty Bastard on stage, security rushed in and cleared the podium, throwing Cilvaringz back into the crowd. Not knowing how to get backstage Cilvaringz lost contact with RZA. According to Cilvaringz, RZA had just told him that he was interested in signing him to Wu-Tang Clan's extended group the Wu-Tang Killa Beez.|$|R
5000|$|Gough practised {{top-down}} {{command to}} a degree which was unusual in the British Army of that era, with its culture, evolved in an army designed for fighting small colonial wars, of leaving decisions to [...] "the man on the spot". Andy Simpson argues that although Gough's command methods were clearly more prescriptive than those of Rawlinson's Fourth Army, in which a 20-page summary of division commanders' views was circulated in late August, given Rawlinson's lack of grip this was not necessarily a bad thing. Simpson argues that Gough's hands-on control may have been at Haig's urging, given Haig's dissatisfaction with Rawlinson, and suggests that this {{may also have been}} a factor in Gough being employed in major offensives in 1917, whereas Rawlinson was not. Michael Howard cited Gough's love of micro-managing divisions as evidence that he had been overpromoted, and Gary Sheffield concedes that Gough's reputation for touring the trenches to <b>spot</b> <b>dirty</b> rifles suggests that he had found it hard to adapt to his greater responsibilities.|$|R
5000|$|Neil (voiced by Ted Cole) - [...] "The Good Looking," [...] {{descendant}} of Narcissus. The {{last of the}} seven to join the group, Neil is 16 years old and exceptionally handsome and knows it, as {{he works as a}} freelance model and has his photos plastered all over New Olympia. Archie once said that: [...] "The only person Neil loves is Neil." [...] He nearly sided with Cronus, believing the god to be a top agent in the entertainment industry before the Olympians got to him. His lifestyle made him a spoiled brat, and the others initially harbored some doubts of his status as a [...] "hero." [...] He always has a monogrammed three-paneled mirror on-hand, which includes an autographed picture of himself that flips out of the middle mirror. Neil considers himself to be quite cultured and an all around fashion expert, and is easily upset if his clothes become <b>dirty</b> or <b>spotted.</b> He is notorious for being late and is also obsessed with horror films focused on vampires and werewolves. However, he is extremely lucky, which helps defeat far more powerful foes, as well as help him with minor things like always winning coin tosses and board games. He wants to prove to the team that he is a hero. He tends to be rather blunt, has a high opinion of himself, and is easily startled. Neil generally does not wield a weapon, much to his annoyance, but is usually able to use weapons like tasers and Hecate's torches with great effect, likely because of his natural luck. But in episode 24: Sybaris Fountain, he finds himself very capable against Sybaris' vampire minions (with a water gun filled with holy water). He emits a high-pitched girlish scream when frightened, his worst fears are, not surprisingly, becoming bald, gaining weight, and developing skin problems. He also snores quite loudly when he sleeps to the irritation of the other teen heroes. Despite his self-centered attitude, Neil does care deeply for his friends and will do whatever he can to help them when they need him most, even if it means putting aside the well-being of himself and his hair, though he does enjoy making fun of Odie especially in The Trojan Horse, but Jay often tells him to back off. His mentor is Aphrodite.|$|R
40|$|Understanding a user 2 ̆ 7 s natural {{interaction}} {{is a challenge}} {{that needs to be}} addressed in order to enable novice users to use robots smoothly and intuitively. While using a set ofhard-coded commands to control a robot is usually rather reliable and easy to implement, it is troublesome for the user, because it requires him/her to learn and remember special commands in order to interact with the robot and does not allow the user to use his or her natural interaction style. Understanding natural, unrestricted spoken language and multi-modal user behavior would be desirable but is still an unsolved problem. Therefore, this dissertation proposes a domain-specific approach to enable a robot to learn to understand its user 2 ̆ 7 s natural way of giving commands and feedback through naturalinteraction in special virtual training tasks. The user teaches the robot to understand his/her individual way of expressing approval, disapproval and a limited number ofcommands using speech, prosody and touch. In order to enable the robot to pro-actively explore how the user gives commands and provoke approving and disapproving reactions, the system uses special training tasks. During the training, the robot cannot actually understand its user. In order to enable the robot to react appropriately anyway, the training tasks are designed in such a way that the robot can anticipate the user 2 ̆ 7 s commands and feedback - e. g. by using games which allow the user to judge easily whether a move of the robot was good or bad and give appropriate feedback, so that the robot can accurately guess whether to expect positive or negative feedback and even provoke the feedback it wants to learn by deliberately making good or bad moves. In this work, "virtual" training tasks are used to avoid time-consuming walking motion and to enable the robot to access all properties of the task instantly. The task-scene is shown on a screen and the robot visualizes its actions by motion, sounds and its LEDs. A first experiment for learning positive and negative feedback uses easy games, like "Connect Four" and "Pairs" in which the robot could explore the user 2 ̆ 7 s feedback behavior by making good or bad moves. In a follow-up study, which was conducted with a child-sized humanoid robot as well as pet-robot AIBO, this work has been extended for learning simple commands. The experiments used a "virtual living room", a simplified living room scene, in which the user can ask the robot to fulfill tasks such as switching on the TV or serying a coffee. After learning the names of the different objects in the room by pointing at them and asking the user to name them, the robot requests from the task server to show a situation that requires a certain action to be performed by the robot: E. g. the light is switched off so that the room is too dark. The user responds to this situation by giving the appropriate command to the robot: "Hey robot, can you switch the light on?" or "It 2 ̆ 7 s too dark here!". By correct/incorrect performance, the robot can provoke positive/negative feedback from the user. One of the benefits of "virtual" training tasks is that the robot can learn commands, that the user cannot teach by demonstration, but which seem to be necessary for a service or entertainment robot, like showing the battery status, recharging, shutting down, etc. The robot learns by a two-staged algorithm based on Hidden Markov Models and classical conditioning, which is inspired by associative learning in humans and animals. In the first stage, which corresponds to the stimulus encoding in natural learning, unsupervised training of HMMs is used to model the incoming speech and prosody stimuli. Touch stimuli are represented using a simple duration-based model. Unsupervised training of HMMs allows the system to cluster similar perceptions without depending on explicit transcriptions of what the user has said or done, which are not available when learning through natural interaction. Utterances and meanings can usually not be mapped one-to-one, because the same meaning can be expressed by multiple utterances, and utterances can have different meanings. This is handled by the associative learning stage. It associates the trained HMMs with meanings and integrates perceptions from different modalities, using an implementation of classical conditioning. The meanings are inferred from the robot 2 ̆ 7 s situation. E. g. If the robot just requested the task server to show a <b>dirty</b> <b>spot</b> on the carpet, the robot assumes, the following utterance means clean(carpet), so the system first searches for a match of any of the HMMs, associated with the meaning "carpet". Then, the remainder of the utterance is used to train a HMM sequence to be associated with the meaning "to clean". The positions of the detected parameters are used to insert appropriate placeholders in the recognition grammar. In a first study, based on game-like tasks, the robot learned to discriminate between positive and negative feedback based on speech, prosody and touch with an average accuracy of 95. 97...|$|R
