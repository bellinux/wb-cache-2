5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbald lived until 757 {{and carried}} Mercian {{power to a}} new height. His debt to Crowland was not forgotten: soon after his {{accession}} he richly endowed a new church on the site where Guthlac had lived as a hermit. The first Life of Guthlac, written by the monk Felix, appeared soon after Guthlac's death. Nothing is known about Felix, although Bertram Colgrave <b>has</b> <b>observed</b> {{that he was a}} good scholar who evidently had access to works by Bede and Aldhelm, to a Life of Saint Fursey and Latin works by Saint Jerome, Saint Athanasius and Gregory the Great. Felix was either an East Anglian or was living in the kingdom when he wrote the book, which was written at the request of Ælfwald. In the Life, Felix portrays Æthelbald's exile at Crowland and asserts Ælfwald's right to rule in East Anglia. Two Old English verse versions of the Life drawn on the work of Felix were written, which show the vigour of vernacular heroic and elegiac modes in Ælfwald's kingdom.|$|E

25|$|While diseconomies {{of scale}} are {{typically}} associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies.
