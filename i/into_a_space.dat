The highly stylized murals painted in black on the side walls have been retouched. They consist of bands of decorations with contains elements such as letters, niches and coats of arms. This entrance area ends with an arch that opens into the main nave. This area serves as the baptistery and contains three monolithic pieces, which originally were part of the teocalli. The first two are used for baptisms. The first is the large basin to hold water for baptism. The second, called a “piscina” is meant to receive the water that pours off the head of the one being baptized. On the outside of the main basin, there are the heads of animals and humans, which may indicate that the bowl was originally part of a fountain, readapted to its current function. The heads that protrude indicate the duality of life with the masculine represented by a jaguar and the feminine represented by a woman. The use of a jaguar symbol indicates Olmec influence. Next to these two, there is a small pillar with worn, unidentifiable designs, whose purpose are unknown.|$|E

It was proved in [JR] that ℓp does not coarsely embed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert <b>space</b> when p> 2. The present article is a strengthening of that result by giving a full characterization of quasi-Banach spaces that coarsely embed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert <b>space.</b> This result, {{as well as its}} proof, mirrors the theorem in [AMM] which characterizes spaces that uniformly embed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert <b>space.</b> The combination of Theorem 1 and the theorem in [AMM] yield that <b>a</b> quasi-Banach <b>space</b> uniformly embeds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert <b>space</b> if and only if it coarsely embeds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert <b>space.</b> This is counterintuitive in that a uniform embedding gives information only on small distances while a coarse embedding gives information only on large distances.
