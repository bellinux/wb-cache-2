50|$|The Welsh pig is bred commercially {{because it}} {{produces}} high-quality bacon and pork. It provides a lean carcase {{with a high}} <b>killing-out</b> <b>percentage.</b> It retains sufficient fat cover to produce succulent, well-flavoured meat but is not excessively fat. Even when grown on to heavier weights, it grades well. Other advantages include a good feed conversion rate, good mothering abilities and a high survival rate for the piglets. The sows {{can be used in}} a breeding programme with Large White or Landrace boars to produce fast-growing, cross-bred progeny, and the boars can also be used on other rare breed sows to produce leaner, faster-growing young with improved conformation.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the most}} {{prolific}} British breed. Mature ewes achieve an average litter size of more than 3.00 and this advantage carries through to lambs weaned per ewe. Before the breed settled to the desired level of prolificacy, some remarkable records were achieved {{in the early stages}} of the project, with sextuplets being not uncommon and one ewe achieving a lifetime record of 44 lambs in 10 crops. Comparative trials carried out by the Scottish Agricultural College in the 1990s showed that halfbred ewes sired by the British Milksheep achieved a level of productivity 11% higher than halfbreds sired by Bluefaced Leicester and Border Leicester rams, and 26% higher than those sired by Bleu du Maine and Rouge de l’Ouest rams. Average milk yield depends on the standard of management of the flock and can vary from 250 to more than 400 litres in a 210-day lactation, with 6% fat and 6% protein. Some pure flocks continue to be used for dairying and produce milk for consumers with allergy to cows’ milk, ice-cream, and speciality cheeses in northern England and Canada. There are claims that ewes produce 650 L to 900 L of milk in a 300-day lactation with a 5.5 to 9.5% fat content [...] but those claims have not been verified. In comparative trials for milk yield in Hungary, using the local Merino population with a milk yield of 30-50 litres per lactation, British Milksheep crosses proved superior to crosses by Lacaune and Awassi rams. They yielded 90-130 litres compared with 60-80 litres from Lacaune crosses and 80-105 litres from Awassi crosses. The British Milksheep is a white-faced, clean-headed, polled sheep. Ewes produce 4 kg and rams 6.5 kg fleece with a spinning count of 50 to 54s. The staple length is 12 to 18 cm. They have good carcase characteristics. In comparative trials in Hungary for meat production, crossbred lambs sired by British Milksheep had a superior carcase grading, a higher <b>killing-out</b> <b>percentage</b> than crosses sired by Ile de France, Suffolk and Mutton Merino rams, and the meat was the most tender as measured by shear force. British Milksheep are large, robust sheep with a good conformation. At maturity, rams weigh 103 kg and ewes 79 kg on average.|$|E
40|$|Young Watish lambs grazing berseem grow at 148 and 105 g/day {{for males}} & females respectively, over a 20 -week period.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to {{evaluate}} the effects of breed, diet and slaughter weight on growth, carcass composition and meat quality of Serra da Estrela (SE), Merino Branco (MB) and Churro da Terra Quente (CH) lambs, fed with concentrate (CON) or dehydrated lucerne (LUZ) and slaughtered at weaning, 25 and 35 Kg live weight. Average live daily weight gain (ADG), feed intake, carcass composition {{and some of the}} chemical, physical and sensory meat characteristics were studied. MB breed presented better growth performances, considering the higher ADG and the good carcass conformation, allowing the production of heavier lambs. It also showed a higher water holding capacity (WHC) of muscle. SE breed presented intermediate results, standing out a higher muscle/bone (M/B) ratio. Lower ADG, carcass <b>killing-out</b> <b>percentage,</b> WHC and worse conformation were obtained in CH. Breed {{did not seem to be}} an important factor in what concerns meat sensory qualities. Although worse growth performances, lower carcass weight and lower carcass <b>killing-out</b> <b>percentage,</b> LUZ diet allowed good productive results. M/B ratio was smaller with LUZ, but only when lambs were slaughtered at 25 Kg. Between diets, no differences were found in what concerns meat quality. Slaughter weight increase resulted in a better conformation and higher M/B ratio but the prime joints proportion decreased; WHC decreased and intramuscular fat increased with slaughter weight. However between weaning and 35 Kg did not seem to occur important changes in lamb meat qualityAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

40|$|Influence of milk in diet {{of growing}} {{fattening}} Belgian Blue bulls on animal performances and on fatty acid composition in subcutaneous, intermuscular and intramuscular fats. The use of milk as {{component of a}} fattening diet for bulls was studied in an experiment carried-out over 2 years with Belgian Blue bulls. The animals weighed 305 kg {{at the beginning of}} the experiment. In all, 15 bulls were given a control concentrate fattening diet (control group, CG), while 11 others were fed concentrate plus 6. 5 to 11 1 whole milk per day according to weight or age (milk group, MG). The fattening period lasted for 174 and 181 d respectively in groups CG and MG. The MG-group had a higher <b>killing-out</b> <b>percentage</b> (P < 0. 01) and the meat was characterized by a lower b* value and a lower dry matter content (P < 0. 1). Whole milk in the diet increased the proportion of shorter chain and saturated fatty acids in fat (P < 0. 001) and reduced the proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated acids (P < 0. 05; P < 0. 1). The extent of the changes were larger in subcutaneous and intermuscular fats than in intramuscular fat. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Production {{performance}} and meat quality of grazing lambs finished on red clover, lucerne or perennial ryegrass swards. Grass and Forage Science, 59, (4), 345 - 356. Sponsorship: DEFRA / MLCThe combined {{benefits of a}} high crude protein concentration, and possible protein protection and growth-promoting properties, make forage legumes potentially attractive as a natural means of increasing liveweight gain and time to slaughter of lambs in lamb finishing systems. An experiment was conducted to compare the production {{performance and}} meat quality of grazing lambs finished on red clover (Trifolium pratense), lucerne (Medicago sativa) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) swards. Replicate (n = 2) swards of red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass were rotationally grazed by ten ram lambs and ten ewe lambs from weaning until selection for slaughter at UK fat class 3 L. Lambs grazing the red clover sward had a significantly higher liveweight gain and required significantly fewer days to slaughter than lambs grazing the lucerne sward (305 g d? 1 vs. 243 g d? 1; 38 d vs. 50 d), which in turn had a higher liveweight gain and required fewer days to slaughter than lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (184 g d? 1; 66 d). Lambs grazing the red clover and lucerne swards had significantly higher herbage intakes than those grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (2 ? 06, 1 ? 72 and 1 ? 16 kg DM d? 1 respectively), but in vivo digestibility of herbage was similar. Lambs grazing the red clover and lucerne swards also had significantly higher serum urea concentrations than those grazing ryegrass (12 ? 5, 11 ? 1 and 6 ? 2 mmol L? 1 respectively). <b>Killing-out</b> <b>percentage</b> was significantly higher for lambs grazing the red clover sward than for lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (48 % vs. 46 %). There were no significant effects of finishing system on meat flavour, but meat from lambs finished on the lucerne sward was oxidatively less stable than that from lambs finished on the perennial ryegrass sward. Grazing the forage legume swards significantly increased the proportion of linoleic and linolenic acid in muscle tissue, and therefore the proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0 ? 19, 0 ? 16 and 0 ? 12 for the red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass swards respectively). However, the n? 6 /n? 3 ratio was significantly lower for the muscle of lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward compared with those grazing the forage legume swards (1 ? 13, 1 ? 08 and 0 ? 98 for the red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass swards respectively). The results indicate that by grazing lambs on forage legume swards {{it is possible to}} increase individual lamb performance without compromising meat quality. Peer reviewe...|$|E
