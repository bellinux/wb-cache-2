40|$|Many {{economists have}} {{estimated}} hedonic price functions for {{red and white}} wine. However, estimating a single hedonic price function imposes {{the assumption that the}} <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> of the attributes are the same for any red or white wine. We argue that even within these two categories, wines are differentiated, and disregarding this heterogeneity causes an aggregation bias in the estimated <b>implicit</b> <b>prices.</b> By estimating hedonic functions specific to price ranges, we show that the wine market is segmented into several product classes or market segments. We find that a model accounting for the existence of wine classes has greater ability to explain the variability in the data and produces more accurate and interpretable results regarding the <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> of the attributes.

50|$|Susanne Lohmann {{agrees with}} puzzling {{observations}} made by Olson, which she classifies as {{economic and political}} puzzles. Economic puzzles, for instance, are measures that result in a general welfare loss in favour of minority protection, many {{times larger than the}} minority benefit. One example she gives relates to a quota on sugar imports in the United States, which is calculated to generate 2261 jobs at the expense of a general welfare reduction of $1,162 million (Hufbauer and Elliot, 1994). The <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> for a job in the sugar industry is then above $500,000, allowing for significant room for Pareto improvement. Political puzzles relates to cases where minority trumps majority. An example she gives is the so-called rural bias in urbanized and developed countries, of which the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union is a prime example.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} useful to {{consider}} <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> deflators for certain subcategories of GDP, such as computer hardware. In this case, {{it is useful}} to think of the price deflator as the ratio of the current-year price of a good to its price in some base year. The price in the base year is normalized to 100. For example, for computer hardware, we could define a [...] "unit" [...] to be a computer with a specific level of processing power, memory, hard drive space and so on. A price deflator of 200 means that the current-year price of this computing power is twice its base-year price - price inflation. A price deflator of 50 means that the current-year price is half the base year price - price deflation. This can lead to a situation where official statistics reflect a drop in prices, even though they have stayed the same.|$|E

They are equivalent when the equilibrium condition holds but, {{in the absence of}} such equilibrium, only the subjective well-being approach is theoretically correct. In an empirical application, we find that (i) the total impact of location-specific amenities on self-reported well-being is not fully captured through compensating differentials in labor and housing markets, indicating that <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> derived using the hedonic approach would be incorrect and thus suggesting caution in its application, and (ii) environmental factors are as important as the most critical socio-economic and socio-demographic factors in explaining subjective well-being...|$|R

30|$|The <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> {{of any of}} the good’s {{attributes}} can {{be determined}} by looking at how people {{are willing to pay for}} the good changes if this particular attribute changes. The schedule of prices of the good determined by market forces in any particular market can be summarized by a hedonic price function which is unique to that market, thereby reflecting the specific conditions of supply-and-demand at a specific locality (Latinopoulos et al. 2004). In this analysis, the <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> of irrigation water was implied equally as WTP for one cubic meter of water for the farmer.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ecosystem}} resilience is being increasingly discussed {{as a driver}} of biodiversity values. It implies that marginal deteriorations in ecosystem conditions can abruptly result in non-marginal and irreversible changes in ecosystem functioning and the economic values that the ecosystem generates. This challenges the traditional approach to the valuation of biodiversity, which has focused on quantifying values attached to individual species or other elements of ecosystems. As yet, {{little is known about}} the value society attaches to changes in ecosystem resilience. This paper investigates this value. A discrete choice experiment is used to estimate <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> for attributes used to describe ecosystem resilience using the Border Ranges rainforests in Australia as an example.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} prices of three {{aesthetic}} externalities (the presence of a water view, the appearance of nearby improvements, {{and the quality of}} landscaping in the neighborhood) in residential property markets. In particular, we focus on how the <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> of such characteristics change with the residential real estate cycle. Given that the supply of these attributes is limited, one would expect their <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> to vary with the real estate cycle, contrary to what would be expected for {{the prices of}} property characteristics that are in relatively elastic supply. We also examine how the price premium for a water view varies across cities with the supply of such views. The empirical analyses are performed using hedonic models and a rich database of all residential sales transactions from 1986 to 1996 for the three largest urban areas in New Zealand—Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington. Our results suggest that <b>implicit</b> <b>prices</b> of the aesthetic externalities move with the real estate cycle. We find also that the percentage premiums for water views are greatest in Christchurch, which has the smallest percentage of properties with water views, and lowest in Wellington, which has the highest percentage of properties with views.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of a summary and four papers, concerned with food consumption, behavior associated with overconsumption of food {{and analysis of the}} economic policy reforms designed to improve health. Paper [I] estimates a hedonic price model on breakfast cereal, crisp bread and potato product data. The purpose is to examine the marginal implicit prices for food characteristics associated with health. A trade-off exists between health and taste. For instance, sugar, salt and fat are tasty but can be unhealthy if overconsumed; whereas fiber is unhealthy if underconsumed. If the marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> for sugar is negative, consumers value health over its taste. Our results are the marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> for sugar is negative for breakfast cereals and crisp bread—consumers value health over the taste of sugar. For salt, we find the opposite—a positive marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price,</b> suggesting people value its taste over health. For fat, we find a negative marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> of fat in breakfast cereals and potato products containing salt, whereas we find a positive marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> of fat in hard bread and potato products that contain no salt. For the one healthy characteristic, fiber, we find a negative marginal <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> in breakfast cereals and a positive <b>implicit</b> <b>price</b> in hard bread. Paper [II] uses a general equilibrium model to derive the optimal policy if people overconsume unhealthy food due to self-control problems. Individuals lacking self-control have a preference for immediate gratification, at the expense of future health. We show the optimal policy to help individuals with self-control problems to behave rationally is a combination of subsidies for the health capital stock and the physical capital stock. Paper [III] estimates a demand system for grain consumption based on household panel data and detailed product characteristics, and simulate the effect on grain consumption of economic policy reforms designed to encourage a healthier grain diet. Our results imply it is more cost-efficient to subsidize the fiber content than to subsidize products rich in fiber given the goal to increase the fiber intake of the average Swedish household. Our results also imply subsidies alone give rise to an increase in fiber, and to other unhealthy nutrients. Also, subsidies alone have negative effects on the budget. We therefore simulate the effect of policy reforms in which the subsidies are funded either by taxes on the content of unhealthy nutrients or by taxes on products that are overconsumed. Our results suggest that price instruments need to be substantial to change consumption. For instance, removing the VAT on products rich in fiber has little effect on consumption. Paper [IV] explores habit persistence in breakfast cereal purchases. To perform the analysis, we use a mixed multinomial logit model, on household panel data on breakfast cereal purchases. If habit persistence in consumption is strong, short and long-run responses to policy reforms will differ. Our results are breakfast cereal purchases are strongly associated with habit persistence. Our results also imply preferences for breakfast cereals are heterogeneous over households and the strength of habit persistence is similar over educational and income groups. food consumption; food characteristics; health; willingness-to-pay; habit persistence; preference heterogeneity; taxation; subsidies; quasi-hyperbolic discounting...|$|E
