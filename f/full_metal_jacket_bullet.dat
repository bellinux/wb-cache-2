25|$|Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 British-American war film {{directed}} and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford {{was based on}} Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Its storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training, primarily focusing on two privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through camp under their foul-mouthed drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences {{of two of the}} platoon's Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The film's title refers to the <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>bullet</b> used by soldiers. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 1987.|$|E

50|$|In general, a <b>bullet</b> <b>jacket</b> {{allows for}} higher muzzle {{velocities}} than bare lead without depositing {{significant amounts of}} metal in the bore. It also prevents damage to bores from steel or armor-piercing core materials. Historically, the first successful <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> rifle <b>bullets</b> were invented by Col.

2500|$|The Mk VII was {{different}} from earlier [...]303 bullet designs or spitzer projectiles in general. Although {{it appears to be}} a conventional spitzer-shape <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>bullet,</b> this appearance is deceptive: its designers made the front third of the interior of the Mk 7 bullets out of aluminium (from Canada) or tenite (cellulosic plastic), wood pulp or compressed paper, instead of lead and they were autoclaved to prevent wound infection. This lighter nose shifted the centre of gravity of the bullet towards the rear, making it tail heavy. Although the bullet was stable in flight due to the gyroscopic forces imposed on it by the rifling of the barrel, it behaved very differently upon hitting the target. As soon as the bullet hit the target and decelerated, its heavier lead base caused it to pitch violently and deform, thereby inflicting more severe gunshot wounds than a standard single-core spitzer design. In spite of this, the Mk VII bullet was legal due to the full metal jacket used according to the terms of the Hague Convention.|$|E

50|$|Jacketed {{flat point}} (JFP) may {{describe}} either soft-point or <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>bullets</b> with a flat, {{rather than a}} rounded front. Until recently, flat-point bullets were required in centerfire rifles with tubular magazines, such as the Winchester rifle, where the rounds are stored front-to-back. Use of metal-pointed bullets in these rifles can be highly dangerous, as {{the point of the}} bullet will rest against the primer of the round in front of it and can cause a detonation under the force of recoil. Since late 2005, newer bullet designs with polymer tips offering improved ballistics have become available for safe use in tubular magazine rifles.|$|R

50|$|Wadcutters are {{typically}} made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels {{and into the}} forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (<b>Full</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Jacket)</b> <b>bullets</b> are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques {{may be used to}} remove the lead build-up caused from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity.|$|R
50|$|A <b>full</b> <b>metal</b> <b>jacket</b> (FMJ) <b>bullet</b> is a small-arms {{projectile}} {{consisting of}} a soft core (often lead) encased in a shell of harder metal, such as gilding metal, cupronickel, or less commonly a steel alloy.

Lead, copper, zinc and nickel, including the proportion of lead and copper were measured from the retained bullets to determine the relationship between these metals and types of bullets by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer to determine. There was not much zinc and nickel detected on all three bullet types, whereas a lot of lead and copper was evident. Though lead and copper levels were significantly different among the three types of bullets, and only their proportion might be useful for distinguishing them from each other.
