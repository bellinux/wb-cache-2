Nowadays, the role of fire to the space (architecture) lessened and even disappeared along with technology development. Contrarily, the phenomenon in Tengger showed different result. The presence <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> (pawon) in Tenggerese house became stronger. It could {{be seen from the}} increasing number <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> there. This research shows, there was a close connection between society structure along with time factor and the number <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> along with its use in Tenggerese house. The number <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> in a house could be increased if the number of family members were increased as well. It is possible that the segmentation <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> space in Tenggerese house could be affected by the influence of the number of family members to the changes <b>of</b> <b>hearth.</b> This possibility would be explored in the research. Interpretive-Historic research method was used in the research to explore the phenomenon found in the field. By exploring field data and historical data, it was finally shown the influence of the changes number in family members to the segmentation <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> space in Tenggerese house, particularly those related to the marriage and mortality. Space segmentation, especially segmentation <b>of</b> the <b>hearth</b> space in Tengger successfully demonstrated a close link with the change in the numbers of family members...|$|R

50|$|A decade later, Margaret Spufford {{cleared a}} path for local historians {{interested}} in studying local variations in wealth and poverty at county and parish levels, and set out the relevance <b>of</b> the <b>hearth</b> tax to architectural history and genealogy. She developed Hoskins’ argument that the numbers <b>of</b> <b>hearths</b> in a household could be equated with levels of personal wealth, and that by organising the properties into groups determined by the number <b>of</b> <b>hearths,</b> historians could assess patterns of wealth and poverty which distinguished between social categories. She placed this system within a national template, and tested the divergences in wealth between counties, areas within counties, and parishes.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the {{function}} <b>of</b> prehistoric <b>hearths</b> and {{to take the first}} step in creating guidelines for the excavation, sampling and analysis <b>of</b> prehistoric <b>hearths.</b> Although the study <b>of</b> <b>hearths</b> and their function can provide valuable information about past human behaviour there appear to be no real guidelines available for this type of research. This results in loss of valuable information and possible misinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>hearths.</b> Part 1 <b>of</b> this thesis gives an introduction of various aspects <b>of</b> <b>hearths,</b> such as their origins, their forms and functions, different types of fuel and some analysis methods that can be applied to study them. Part 2 consists of a case study <b>of</b> a <b>hearth</b> from the French middle Neolithic site Trinité-sur-Mer. For this study one <b>of</b> the 15 <b>hearths</b> present at the site was analysed in order to determine its function. For this purpose reflectance analysis carried out on the charcoal fragments from three different samples from the hearth in order {{to get an idea of}} the temperatures that were reached in the hearth. Some specific choices regarding the manner of sampling and processing the samples were made and phytolith analysis was carried out to determine whether these choices resulted in as little damage and loss of material as possible. It was found that the choices made within this study had the desired effect. Furthermore the reflectance analysis and fuel determination showed that the hearth from Trinité-sur-Mer probably was a domestic hearth fuelled with wood of Quercus sp. and reached temperatures of at least 400 °C...|$|R

40|$|Concentrations of heat-fractured rock {{are common}} {{in some areas of}} western New South Wales, Australia, and are {{frequently}} identified during archaeological surveys as the eroded remains <b>of</b> heat-retainer <b>hearths,</b> a type <b>of</b> earth oven used in the past by Aboriginal people to cook food. However, {{it can be difficult to}} consistently identify these features since heat-fractured rocks, like other clasts lying on the surface, can be dispersed or concentrated by a variety of geomorphic processes. In this paper, we describe a method we have developed for hearth identification and description to aid the consistent recording of these features. We recommend the use of a fluxgate gradiometer as a tool to verify that concentrations of heat-fractured rock are indeed the eroded remains <b>of</b> heat-retainer <b>hearths.</b> Using a gradiometer reduces observer variability and ensures that we are not overestimating the number <b>of</b> <b>hearths</b> present by including naturally occurring groups of stones not related to hearth activity. Adoption by others of a common method <b>of</b> <b>hearth</b> identification and classification would provide some degree of standardisation that will aid understanding of the patterns of Aboriginal occupation in the past. 11 page(s...|$|R
