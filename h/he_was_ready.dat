5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to make peace with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Báthory {{lost his}} throne {{and his life}} {{fighting}} against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, wondering whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{advanced}} course, Middleton {{spent the summer}} as the senior instructor at a Reserve Officer Training Camp at Fort Logan, Colorado, then returned to Camp Benning for one more year {{as a member of}} the Infantry Board. Four years at Benning had been enough for him and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to move on. After expressing his wishes to a senior officer, he was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the summer of 1923, a place he had been eleven years earlier to prepare for his officer's commission.|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E
5|$|After {{a meeting}} between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to do it. Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe {{was drawn to the}} project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity. Production was slated in summer 2006.|$|E

5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The choice {{was seen as a}} surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not run for president again led to expectations that the Social Democrats (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to run for the office. The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E

5|$|Having {{played the}} final year of his {{existing}} contract, Bieksa addressed his pending unrestricted free agency by telling the media <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to re-sign for less than market value in order to remain with the Canucks. Shortly thereafter, on June 27, 2011, Bieksa signed a five-year, $23 million contract extension. The deal came with a no-trade clause and was reported to be front-loaded, with Bieksa making $7 million in his first year, followed by $4.5 million, $5 million, $4 million and $2.5 million annual salaries. The deal kept the popular defenceman amongst the core for another chance at winning a Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 2011 {{to work for}} Cartoon Network. He has written and storyboarded for Regular Show, another {{production}} on the network. His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want. Initially unsure if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to pitch AJ's Infinite Summer, the network rejected the pilot {{the first time he}} did but approved it on the second, after he had reworked it throughout a few months. Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E
5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. Anthony {{said that he}} would not record in English until he felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to do so. After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E
5|$|Hananu {{and some}} of his aides {{traveled}} to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid. In the course of that month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army. Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks. In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to coordinate with Hananu's rebels.|$|E
