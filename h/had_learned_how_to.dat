25|$|The {{development}} of the triumphal arch {{is often associated with}} ancient Roman architecture. To fully understand this development however {{it is important to understand}} the importance of basic arches in Roman civilization. The Romans <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> construct effective arches from the Etruscans, who lived in central Italy. This knowledge had a major impact on the architecture of Roman civilization. As a result, the Romans used arches for things such as aqueducts, amphitheaters, bridges, and domed temples. They had effectively used the arch in various aspects of their civilization and city structure. Since the Romans had effectively perfected this architectural structure, one could conclude that the arch symbolized perfection and triumph in Roman society. Monumental gateways had already been in use for hundreds of years by civilizations such as the Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians and Myceneans.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} began {{very slowly}} in the 18th century, but accelerated after the Belgian Revolution, with Brussels as the capital of newly independent Belgium. In spite of the Dutch-speaking majority, French was made the sole official language, and French was {{the language of the}} government, the courts, culture, the media and education. The Dutch language had a low social prestige in Belgium at the time, and knowledge of French was considered necessary for social advancement, and Dutch-speakers suffered discrimination. The massive shift from Dutch to French was underway by the late 19th century. At first there was a surge in the number of bilingual residents, mostly native Dutch-speakers who <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> speak French, at the expense of monolingual Dutch-speakers. As Dutch was often not passed down from one generation to another, the number of monolingual Francophones in Brussels grew considerably. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of bilingual French/Dutch-speakers.|$|E
25|$|When {{a vacancy}} occurred, {{the bishop of}} the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of {{election}} was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot {{should be at least}} 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached {{on the rights of the}} monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} noted by several of the series' {{designers}} that K' {{is one of the}} most difficult characters to illustrate, since his look is very different when he is drawn by different illustrators. In the early development of the game, K' had a slicked back hairstyle, but as it was nixed by his powers, the character's hair was changed. They also jokingly mentioned that the reason for his hair being bushier than it needed to be may be a reflection of the conditions around him. The King of Fighters '99 was developed at the same time as developers noted several similarities between K' and Mark of the Wolves main character, Rock Howard, which caused K's designer to become very nervous. The producer of , Neogeo Hakase, advised advanced players to use K' stating that once the player <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> control him, the character would become very strong during fights.|$|E
500|$|Axelrod {{composed}} Song of Innocence in {{one week}} and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer. He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists. Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33players to perform his notated charts. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky. [...] "That way the sounds don't seem to go all over the place", he later said. [...] "Music seems so small in a studio." [...] Axelrod originally wanted some of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale choir but was uncertain {{if he could find}} the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score.|$|E
500|$|The inaugural flying course {{commenced}} in January 1923. Basic instruction {{took place}} on the Avro 504Ks, and more advanced or specialised training on the school's other aircraft. Fourteen students commenced the year-long course, and twelve graduated. As well as flying, they studied aeronautics, communications, navigation, armament and general military subjects. Squadron Leader Anderson resumed command of No.1 FTS in 1925; the following year he handed over to Wing Commander Adrian Cole, who led the unit until 1929. The first Citizen Air Force (active reserve) pilots' course ran from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 students completing the training. Although 24 accidents occurred, there were no fatalities, leading Cole to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of India rubber or <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> crash [...] "moderately safely". However, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was marred by three fatal accidents. The following year, 29 students graduated—thirteen PAF, nine reserve, and seven destined for exchange with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were replaced by deHavilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths; these were augmented by Gipsy Moths commencing in 1930.|$|E

500|$|Returning to Australia in February 1919, Cole briefly {{spent time}} as a {{civilian}} before accepting a commission in the Australian Air Corps, the short-lived successor to the Australian Flying Corps, in January 1920. On 17June, accompanied by Captain Hippolyte De La Rue, he flew a DH.9 to a height of , setting an Australian altitude record that stood {{for more than ten}} years. He transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force as a flight lieutenant in March 1921, becoming one of its original twenty-one officers. On 30November, he married his cousin Katherine Cole in St Peter's Chapel at Melbourne Grammar School; the couple would have two sons and two daughters. Squadron Leader Cole was posted to England in 1923–24 to attend RAF Staff College, Andover, returning to Australia in 1925 to become Director of Personnel and Training. Promoted to wing commander, {{he was in charge of}} No.1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, from 1926 to 1929. The first Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' course took place during Cole's tenure at No. 1 FTS; although twenty-four accidents occurred, injuries were minor, leading him to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of India rubber or <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> crash [...] "moderately safely".|$|E
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E
