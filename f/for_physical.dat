Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe <b>for</b> <b>physical</b> or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
