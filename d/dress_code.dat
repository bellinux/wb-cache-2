5|$|La Luz del Mundo {{describes}} {{itself as}} the restoration of primitive Christianity. It does not use crosses or images in its worship services and its members do not observe Christmas or Holy Week. Female members follow a <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> that includes long skirts and head coverings during religious services.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is the <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and}} women to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
50|$|Clothing is not {{the only}} thing that <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> may {{regulate}}. Oftentimes, <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> regulate accessories such as jewelry and hats. For instance, with the exception of religious headgear, most <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> deem it inappropriate to wear hats in the workplace. Casual Fridays are sometimes allowed in certain workplaces, which allows the employee to wear jeans or a casual shirt that is inoffensive to others.|$|R
5000|$|Western <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> are <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> in Western culture {{governing}} what garments {{are worn}} together {{and in what}} setting. Examples of <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> are combinations such as [...] "smart casual", or [...] "morning dress". A classification of these codes is normally made for varying levels of formality and times of day. In traditional Western dressing, for men the more formal <b>dress</b> <b>codes,</b> such as [...] "black tie", are highly codified with essentially fixed definitions, mostly unchanged for more than fifty years, while the more casual classifications change very quickly, and a worldwide or widely relevant discussion is impossible. For women, changes in fashion are more rapid.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> {{counted as}} formal wear are the formal <b>dress</b> <b>codes</b> of white tie for evenings and morning dress for daytime. Although some {{consider}} black tie {{for the evening}} and strollers for daytime, as formal, they are semi-formal attires, sartorially speaking.|$|R
5|$|Balls {{are major}} events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called Commemoration balls; the <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events {{during the year}} that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or {{irregular}} basis, and are usually black tie.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official <b>dress</b> <b>code.</b> Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> dust-up made headlines, a letter {{was sent to}} The New York Times by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its {{president}} Belinda Bearden, disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, the <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> was self-imposed by the players {{in an attempt to}} improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8–7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.|$|E

5|$|In August 1987, at {{the annual}} B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for {{competition}} in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she {{would be required to}} wear formal attire that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar <b>dress</b> <b>code.</b> Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated differently from the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{the college}} added its first lay {{faculty members in}} its Departments of Theology and Philosophy, {{as well as its}} first {{full-time}} female faculty member. Two years later, the student <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> was abolished. In 1970, the college decided to admit women starting with the 1971–1972 school year. The same year, the first female administrator was hired. By 1975, the first year women graduated after completing a four-year course of study, women had attained highly visible positions in school organizations. Anne Martha Frank was the first women to edit The Cowl, the school weekly newspaper. Patricia Slonina became the first woman editor of the literary magazine, The Alembic. Ana Margarita Cabrera was the first woman to edit the school yearbook, The Veritas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dress</b> <b>code</b> of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion {{of the movement}} and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E

At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself.

5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal <b>dress</b> <b>code.</b> At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E
5|$|English Open: O'Sullivan {{competed in}} the first of the four Home Nations events, the English Open. In the First Round, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Zhang Anda 4–1. He won despite injuring his ankle prior to the match, and was forced to play in trainers in violation of the player's <b>dress</b> <b>code.</b> World Snooker later gave O'Sullivan permission to wear trainers {{for the rest of the}} Open. In the Second Round, O'Sullivan beat Mark Davis 4–1, compiling back-to-back century breaks of 136 and 134 in the last two frames of the match. In the Third Round, he continued his good form, winning 4–1 against Zhang Yong. O'Sullivan compiled three centuries during the Third Round match. The match was interrupted at the end of the final frame by a female spectator running around the table. Despite the distraction, O'Sullivan continued playing and potted the pink ball for a break of 129 before he offered his cue to the spectator so she could take his last shot (where she missed twice) before being led away by security. In the Last Sixteen match, O'Sullivan trailed John Higgins 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 before triumphing in the decider and winning 4–3. In the Quarterfinals O'Sullivan beat Jack Lisowski 5–2. In the Semifinals O'Sullivan scored a 6–4 victory over Anthony McGill to reach the Final. In the Final, O'Sullivan defeated Kyren Wilson 9–2 for his 29th ranking title. During the Final match he compiled four centuries and had a pot success of 98%, missing only a total of 6 balls during the 11 frames played. Altogether, O'Sullivan compiled 12 centuries during the tournament, more than any other competitor. This was O'Sullivan's first victory in a ranking event in more than 20 months.|$|E
