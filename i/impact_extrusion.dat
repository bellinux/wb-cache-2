The novel approach is applied to axially <b>impacted</b> <b>extrusion</b> profiles as well as to an assembly of extrusion profiles under varying input parameters.

40|$|Starch, {{the major}} source of {{carbohydrates}} in commercial avian diets, is the most abundant storage polysaccharide in plants. Native starches differ in granule size, amylose to amylopectin ratio and amylose structure. Extrusion in simple terms is a process of cooking under pressure, moisture and elevated temperature. There are several effects of extrusion processing on protein, lipid and starch by changing physical, chemical and nutritional properties. Yet, starch plays a key role during extrusion, and undergoes several significant structural changes, which include starch gelatinisation, melting and fragmentation.

40|$|Extrusion {{cooking is}} {{commonly}} used to produce dry pet foods. As a process involving heat treatment, extrusion cooking can have both beneficial and {{detrimental effects on the}} nutritional quality of the product.

Undesirable effects of extrusion include reduction of protein quality due to e. g. the Maillard reaction, decrease in palatability and loss of heat-labile vitamins. Effects of extrusion processing on the nutritional values of feeds for livestock have been well documented. Literature results concerning effects of extrusion on dry pet foods, however, are scarce.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{production}} of hydrosilylated impact polypropylene (PP) copolymer {{has been demonstrated}} in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. This has been accomplished through a two-step reactive extrusion process that involves: (i) the formation of terminal double bonds on a commodity PP copolymer through peroxide initiated degradation reactions, and (ii) the melt-phase functionalization of these double bonds with hydride-terminated polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS). Spectroscopic analysis of the peroxide degraded PP and the purified hydrosilylated PP has been performed to confirm the attachment of PDMS onto the PP chains. In addition, the hydrosilylated PP has been characterized in terms of molecular, rheological, surface, and mechanical properties. It {{has been found that}} the two-step hydrosilylation reaction decreases molecular weight, imparts formation of branching/chain extension, decreases impact strength, and improves surface hydrophobicity. Finally, oscillatory shear measurements exhibit an unusual up-turn in the viscosity curve at low frequencies.

40|$|An {{often used}} oxygen {{scavenger}} is {{a blend of}} iron powder and additives dispersed in a polymer carrier matrix. It is applied as an additive for separate layers of multilayer film structures which are produced by coextrusion. Not much is known about the influence of multiple extrusions, for example during recycling processes, of these materials on polymer properties, film properties and process stability. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} assess these issues. The focus was on polypropylene because it is a common blend partner for iron-based oxygen scavenger additives. Pure polypropylene and blends of polypropylene with approximately 20 wt. -% iron-based oxygen scavenger additive (SHELFPLUS® O 2 2710) were extruded up to ten times at two temperature profiles (T 1 : 160 – 230 °C; T 2 : 210 – 300 °C). Polymer degradation was evaluated by different means of measurement: MFR, DSC, colorimetry, IR-spectroscopy and oxygen absorption. The results indicate that polypropylene and polypropylene with dispersed oxygen scavenger degrade by the <b>impact</b> of <b>extrusion</b> which can be seen by increased MFR and crystallinity and color changes. Furthermore the iron particles did undergo changes regarding color and oxygen scavenging capacity. The absorption capacity at 23 °C was reduced by one third from 39 to 48 mg oxygen per one gram scavenger additive after one extrusion to 26 – 35 mg oxygen per one gram scavenger additive after 9 and 10 extrusion cycles, respectively. Overall the iron based oxygen scavenger has a lower impact on degradation than the temperature and the number of extrusions...|$|R
40|$|This Study {{investigated}} the <b>impact</b> of thermoplastic <b>extrusion</b> on the nutritive quality of bovine rumen protein. Proximal composition, {{amino acid profile}} and in vivo true protein digestibility among rats were determined in raw (RBR) and extruded (EBR) rumen. Raw and extruded bovine rumen presented high percentages of protein (more than 95 % on dry basis). Neither raw nor extruded proteins had any limiting amino acid, and the RBR and EBR amino acid scores were, respectively, 1. 28 (leucine) and 1. 25 (methionine plus cystine). Extrusion reduced significantly true protein digestibility from 97. 7 % to 93. 1 % (p < 0. 001), but protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scores for both proteins (RBR and EBR) were 100 %. Animal growth presented comparable profiles using raw and extruded rumen. In conclusion, thermoplastic extrusion {{did not affect the}} protein quality of bovine rumen, and this does not hinder the use of this material as a food ingredient. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Observational data {{concerning}} floor-fractured craters on {{the lunar}} {{near and far}} sides are examined, including the morphologic classification of the craters, their spatial and size distributions, and their floor, peak, and rim elevations relative to the maria. Six morphologic classes and two subclasses are delineated {{on the basis of}} fracture pattern, crater floor depth, and floor type. These data are used to reconstruct a history of crater modification which accounts for the large differences in affected crater size and age, the small peak-rim elevation differences, remnant central peaks within mare-flooded craters and ringed plains, ridged and flat-topped rim profiles of heavily modified craters and ringed plains, as well as the absence of positive gravity anomalies in most floor-fractured craters and some large mare-filled craters. The results indicate that: (1) impact craters became centers of intrusions and volcanism generally related to periods of basin inundation by mare basalts; (2) some light-plains units in the highlands may be due to both <b>impact</b> ejecta and <b>extrusions</b> of light-colored lava or ash; (3) floor-fractured craters may have become important volcanic vents that contributed to the inundation of the lunar surface by mare basalts; and (4) the lunar highlands probably did not fully escape the epochs of mare flooding...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{degradation}} upon melting {{is one of}} {{the major}} drawbacks reported for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). However, the role of residues originating from the fermentation and the extraction steps on the thermal stability of this class of biopolymers still needs to be clarified. In the particular case of PHA produced from mixed microbial cultures (MMC), this topic is even less documented in the literature. Here, two polyhydroxy(butyrate-co-valerate) (PHBV) produced from MMC enriched in PHA accumulating organisms and fed with cheese whey were studied. A micro extrusion line is used to produce filaments and assess the processability and the degradation of processed PHBV. The prototype micro extrusion line allows for studying grams of materials. The two PHBV contain 18 mol% HV. PHBV was recovered with 11 wt% residues, and further submitted to a purification procedure resulting in a second biopolyester containing less than 2 wt% impurities. The thermorheological characterization of the two PHBV is first presented, together with their semicrystalline properties. Then the processing windows of the two biopolyesters are presented. Finally, the properties of extruded filaments are reported and the thermomechanical degradation of PHBV is extensively studied. The structure was assessed by wide angle X-ray diffraction, mechanical and rheological properties are reported, thermal properties are studied with differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, whereas Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy was used to assess the <b>impact</b> of the <b>extrusion</b> on PHBV chemical structure.

40|$|Cold {{extrusion}} is {{a process}} commonly used to manufacture drive train components in the automotive industry. Large plastic strains can be applied during this operation (up to 1. 5) and greatly changes the mechanical properties of the resulting material. This study focuses on the <b>impact</b> of cold <b>extrusion</b> process parameters on the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of steel components. A specific set of forward rod extrusion tools was developed to get original fatigue specimen able to characterise {{the effect of the}} manufacturing process on the fatigue behaviour. The specimens were extruded from two different initial diameters, giving two different reductions in cross-section of 18 % and 75 % respectively. To understand the influence of cold extrusion, the following analyses have been undertaken for each condition and on the initial material: monotonic tensile properties, microstructure, EBSD, residual stresses and hardness. Simulation of the forming process and microstructural observations show that the plastic strain is homogeneous in the specimen section. For both reduction factors, the forming process has a positive effect on the components properties: induced residual stresses in compression and improved hardness and roughness (Ra decreasing). Tension, plane bending and torsion fatigue tests show that the fatigue strength is about 30 % higher for the batch with 75 % reduced cross-section. All investigations show that strain hardening is the principal material parameter responsible for the increase in fatigue strength. A multiaxial fatigue criterion taking into account the effects of the forward rod extrusion process was also developed. This work has been performed within the ANR (National Research Agency) DEFISURF project, in a partnership including several industrial (Ascometal, Cetim, PSA, Transvalor, Atelier des Janves, Gévelot) and academic (INSA Lyon MATEIS, ENSMP-CEMEF, Arts et Métiers ParisTech LAMPA) institutions...|$|R
50|$|Though {{they have}} usually {{prevented}} {{far more serious}} accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone, and an engineer determines that the structure has a potential to be impacted {{and the impact of}} a vehicle withthat structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail that was placed to contain and redirect a vehicle away from that structure, knowing that the potential to impact the guardrail will be much higher than that of the sign structure. Guardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object crash. Among the primary reasons for {{this is the type of}} treatment used at the end of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an <b>extrusion</b> <b>impact</b> head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.|$|R

40|$|Keywords:microforming, micromanufacturing, <b>impact</b> <b>extrusion,</b> shear displacement, {{hybrid forming}} Abstract. The Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 39 PT-PIESA is {{developing}} mass production technologies and process chains for the fabrication of aluminium piezo composites, {{which can be}} used as raw material for "smart sheet metal " [1]. Microstructuring by forming is a challenging task con-cerning material flow, tool and process design [2]. In this study, a hybrid forming process combined of micro <b>impact</b> <b>extrusion</b> and shear displacement is presented and discussed. The formed microstructure consists of ten parallel primary cavities with cross sections of 0. 3 0. 3 mm 2 and four larger secondary cavities which are surrounding the primary cavities. High demands are made concerning precision and reproducibility of the cavities ' geometry according to the function of the cavities, which is to serve as collets for sensitive piezo rods. The microstructure has to be formed with one stroke of the stamp. Micro backward <b>impact</b> <b>extrusion</b> is chosen for structuring the primary cavities since it allows accu-rate forming without aligning die plate and stamp due to a flat die plate. Shear displacement forming, which is the selected process for the secondary cavities, requires a structured and aligned die plate but the forming forces are significantly lower than forming the same geometry with an extrusion process, which in turn increases the accuracy. The investigations are focused on the characterization of samples formed with the hybrid process in comparison to structures which are formed solely by impact extru-sion. Geometric parameters, material flow and process parameters were evaluated to assess the hybrid process. First experiments show promising results, whereas higher degrees of deformation could be reached at lower forming forces...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryGreg AldrichNovel {{ingredients}} fuel {{growth in}} the pet food market. Sorghum grain is a promising ingredient source. It grows in semi-arid regions and the pericarp is rich in phenolic compounds that are well-known antioxidants. The objectives were to determine the impact of milling sorghum on yield and composition of the various fractions, their <b>impact</b> on diet <b>extrusion,</b> and nutrient utilization when fed to dogs. Sorghum milling yields were 68. 3 % flour, 27. 2 % mill-feed, and 1. 25 % germ. Four nutritionally similar dog diets were extruded containing whole sorghum (WSD), sorghum flour (FLD), sorghum mill-feed (MFD), or a control diet (CON) with an equal proportion of corn, wheat and rice. The MFD had the highest (P < 0. 05) bulk density and was 1. 37 -fold heavier than FLD. The FLD had a sectional expansion index (SEI) of 1. 92 and 1. 35 -fold more than MFD and WSD. The FLD and MFD had the hardest kibbles (P < 0. 05). Twelve Beagle dogs were fed the experimental diets in a 4 period replicated Latin square design with 9 d adaptation and 5 d total fecal collection (TFC). Fecal output was also estimated using acid insoluble ash (AIA), Cr₂O₃ and TiO₂. Plasma antioxidant activity was measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. Fecal scores were highest (P < 0. 05) for MFD treatment and lowest for CON, with FLD and WSD similar to both extremes. Dogs fed the MFD had the largest quantity (P < 0. 05) of feces excreted and FLD the least. Dogs fed the FLD had highest (P < 0. 05) overall nutrient digestibility values; whereas, MFD had the lowest values. TiO₂ estimates of fecal output correlated best to all other markers. The MFD had more than 2 -fold (P < 0. 05) the antioxidant value by ORAC versus the other treatments (20, 482 vs average 8, 923 μM Trolox Equivalent/L). This study suggests that sorghum flour would benefit easy-to-digest foods and the sorghum mill-feed could benefit foods needing indigestible fiber and antioxidants. Titanium dioxide {{may be a better}} marker for fecal output than Cr₂O₃ or TFC. Future work should determine the optimal mill-feed level to provide health benefits without affecting nutrient digestibility...|$|R
40|$|Seamless {{tubes of}} {{stainless}} steel can be extruded using glass as a lubricant in the Ugine-Sejournet process. The process is performed at high temperature and is associated with large deformations and high strain rates. The use of finite element modeling (FEM) in the analysis and design of extrusion and other metal forming processes is constantly increasing. Computer models that with adequate accuracy can describe the material behavior during extrusion can be very useful for product and process development. The process development in industrial extrusion today is, to a great extent, based on trial and error. This often involves full size experiments which are expensive, time consuming and interfere with the production. It would be of great value if these experiments could be performed in a computer. In this work, FE models of the stainless steel tube extrusion process were developed and used. Simulations were carried out for different tube dimensions and three different materials: two austenitic stainless steels and one duplex (austenitic/ferritic) stainless steel. The models were validated by comparing the predicted values of extrusion force with measurements from production presses. A large number of input parameters are used in a FE analysis of extrusion. This includes boundary conditions, initial conditions and parameters that describe the mechanical and thermal properties of the material. The accuracy of the extrusion simulation depends, to a large extent, on the accuracy of these parameters. Experimental work, both {{in the form of}} material testing and production trials, was performed in order to give an accurate description of the input parameters in these extrusion models. A sensitivity analysis was performed for one of the models and the results showed that the initial billet temperature is the parameter that has the strongest <b>impact</b> on the <b>extrusion</b> force. In order to study the temperature evolution in the billet during manufacturing, the entire process chain at extrusion {{of stainless steel}} tubes was simulated using FEM. This process flow model includes sub-models of induction heating, expansion and extrusion. The work includes the use of a dislocation density-based material model for the AISI type 316 L stainless steel. It is expected that this physically based model can be extrapolated to a wider range of strains, strain rates and temperatures than an empirical model, provided that the correct physical processes are described by the model and that no new phenomena occur. This is of interest for steel extrusion simulations since this process is carried out at higher strains and strain rates than what are normally used in mechanical laboratory tests. The developed models have given important contributions to the understanding of different phenomena that occur during extrusion of stainless steel tubes, and can be used to analyze how different process parameters affect the extrusion process.

40|$|Norway is {{the world}} largest {{producer}} of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In 2013 the Norwegian aquaculture industry produced 1. 2 million metric tons salmon {{with the use of}} 1. 5 million metric tons of commercial feeds. The feeds are delivered to the farms in big bags or in bulk and are conveyed pneumatically to the sea cages. Such harsh treatments expose pellets to stress that may give product loss due to abrasion and fragmentation. Feed loss in pneumatic feeding systems is estimated to be in the range of 0. 3 % to 1. 5 %. This equals a yearly additional expense of around 40 to 200 million NOK for the Norwegian salmon industry. To minimize product loss the feed has to be of a consistent and high physical quality. Extrusion processing is a technology that enables production of such feed quality. Physical pellet quality is normally improved by the addition of starch and other binders, but recent research has shown that the protein ingredients in the feed mix also impact the physical quality of extruded feed products. During the last decade several new plant derived protein ingredients has been introduced and partly replaced fishmeal. This has introduced new challenges in fish feed extrusion and stressed the importance to improve the knowledge related to the technical properties of the individual ingredients. The main objectives of this work have been to quantify fishmeal physicochemical properties with significant effects on the extrusion cooking process and physical pellet quality, and to study the plasticization effect of water solubles in fishmeal. Various multivariate analytical techniques have been applied in the studies, such as principal component analysis, partial least squares -and multiple linear regression. In Paper I and II, the impact of variation in fishmeal physicochemical properties were assessed based on standardized extrusion, drying and coating conditions. In Paper III the effect of water-soluble protein level and moisture content on the extrusion process, extrudate phase transitions and physical quality of feed were studied. In Paper IV the influence of fishmeal water solubles and added moisture on glass transition and flow-starting temperature were quantified. The studies in Paper I and II document the complexity of fishmeal as a protein ingredient with significant <b>impact</b> on the <b>extrusion</b> process, starch gelatinization and physical pellet quality. Large differences in technical quality within and between the studied fishmeal types (i. e. herring and sand eel) were observed. The research quantifies a positive effect of increased levels of water-soluble protein on pellet durability and hardness. This can be explained by two different mechanisms: a crosslinking effect of large polypeptides and a plasticizing effect of smaller peptides and amino acids. Differences in peptide size distribution between the two studied groups were identified with the highest level of large polypeptides for herring meal. At an equal level of water-soluble protein, extruded feed containing fishmeal from sand eel had significantly lower physical quality than feed containing herring meal. This can be attributed to differences in thermal and rheological properties between the two studied groups, and improper cooking in the extruder barrel for sand eel based feed mixes. Incomplete cooking or transformation may result in increased levels of particles in the extrudates and poor physical feed quality. The studies also document that fishmeal specifications normally used on the world commodity market inadequately describe the technical properties of fishmeal. In Paper III the effects of water-soluble protein level in fishmeal on extrusion behaviour, phase transitions and physical feed quality were studied. The plasticizing effect of water-soluble protein was comparable to that of moisture. However, in contrast to moisture, addition of water-soluble protein had a positive effect on specific mechanical energy and physical pellet quality. No loss of water-soluble protein during the extrusion process could be observed, confirming that the amino acids and peptides do not form any new covalent bonds in the extrusion process. A non-volatile plasticizer like water-soluble protein will not be removed in the drying process. It will therefore influence the viscoelastic properties of the final product and {{have a positive effect on}} physical pellet quality by establishment of an intermolecular binding network through hydrogen-, ionic bond, and hydrophobic interactions. It can be concluded from the study that water-soluble protein can be used as a processing aid for the fish feed industry, serving multiple purposes as nutrient, plasticizer and binder in extruded fish feed. In Paper IV significant effects of fishmeal water solubles and moisture level on the glass transition and flow-starting temperatures have been documented. The effect of solubles level on the glass transition temperature could be modelled based on the Gordon-Taylor equation. The documented plasticizing effect of water solubles was lower than the effect of moister addition per unit mass, but higher on a molar basis. The plasticization effect can be attributed to the content of low molecular nitrogencompounds. The studied fishmeal model system showed a large composition region of water solubles and moisture with a higher difference between the flow-starting and glass transition temperature than for other reported protein components (i. e. casein, gluten and soya protein isolate). This indicates a reduced temperature effect on viscosity reduction in the rubbery phase for fishmeal in this region. Combined with significantly lower glass transition temperatures, such differences in physicochemical properties may contribute to explain the unique functional properties of fishmeal compared to plant based proteins and casein. This will have positive impact on physical pellet quality and open up the possibility to obtain a satisfactory thermomechanical transformation in the extrusion process at reduced moisture level. </p...|$|R
