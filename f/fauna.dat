40|$|Late Cretaceous elasmobranch <b>faunas</b> {{are known}} from {{numerous}} of NW Europe localities but their palaeoecological characteristics are still poorly known. Recent studies on Anglo-Paris Basin elasmobranch <b>faunas</b> from phosphatic chalks provided detailed {{data on the}} taxonomic composition of these communities. Results based on multiproxy analyses suggest peculiar conditions for Cenomanian <b>faunas</b> with numerous lamniforms and rare nectobenthic taxa indicative of dysoxic conditions. Changes in Turonian faunal composition correlate with a maximum in palaeotemperatures and transgressive environmental conditions. The northern Coniacian glauconitic palaeoenvironment provided cooler and shallow environments suitable for a few species with probable migration patterns. A model is proposed to explain the ecological features of the Santonian–Campanian <b>faunas</b> in which the habitat heterogeneity is the main factor controlling elasmobranch diversity and evenness. The dominance of small-sized species in Santonian–Campanian <b>faunas</b> {{is similar to the}} patterns observed in modern upwelling environments. Low beta diversity of early Campanian <b>faunas</b> suggests that although <b>faunas</b> were from disjunct upwelling erosional channels, the number of such palaeoenvironments provided a wide range of habitats allowing species to migrate depending on local ecological conditions. The Santonian/Campanian global cooling is synchronous with changes in faunal compositions. Larger-scale palaeoecological, palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographical patterns are proposed based on comparisons with a number of other NW Europe elasmobranch <b>faunas...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>fauna</b> of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native <b>fauna</b> was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade.

Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native <b>fauna</b> of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fauna</b> of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as {{vertebrate}} fossils, {{including those}} of dinosaurs, are quite common. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish <b>fauna.</b> Mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial Didelphodon. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus {{has been found in}} marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Dinosaurs dominate the <b>fauna,</b> especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus. Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common, together making up another third of the known <b>fauna.</b> Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and caenagnathids. Intermingled with the Albertosaurus remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod Albertonykus were found. Adult Albertosaurus were the apex predators in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{relative}} contributions of within-habitat diversity [alpha-diversity] and betweenhabitat- diversity [beta-diversity] to regional diversity [gamma-diversity] in marine benthic {{communities of the}} western US {{before and after the}} end-Permian mass extinction. We found that presumably coolwater <b>faunas</b> from the Permian Gerster Limestone and the Park City Formation had low alpha- and betadiversities, comparable to those of low diverse <b>faunas</b> of the Early Triassic. In contrast, tropical Permian <b>faunas</b> had much higher alpha-diversities and a variable pattern of beta-diversity: Whereas <b>faunas</b> of spacelimited bioherms show a positive correlation between beta-diversity and gamma-diversity, beta-diversity in level-bottom <b>faunas</b> is elevated only when gamma-diversity is very high (> 250 species). This contrasting pattern probably reflects differential effects of interspecific competition on habitat partitioning. In lowcompetitive level-bottom <b>faunas,</b> species are able to coexist until competition forces species into their ecological optima, thereby increasing beta-diversity. This effect occurs at much lower gamma-diversities in more competitive reef-bound <b>faunas,</b> causing the observed positive correlation between beta- and gamma-diversity. We suggest that differences in the level of interspecific competition and hence diversity partitioning between Permian and Triassic benthic communities result from the higher average metabolic rates in the Mesozoic mollusc-dominated benthos in contrast to their Permian counterparts...|$|R
