25|$|Australia's first {{production}} four-wheel-drive car-based vehicle—a utility—was {{introduced by}} Ford as an XY model in November 1972. All were fitted with the 250-cu-in six that was {{mounted on a}} 30° slant to provide front axle suspension clearance between the <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> and the sump.|$|E
25|$|Jeep {{advertising}} {{has always}} emphasized the vehicle's off-road capabilities. Today, the Wrangler {{is one of}} the few remaining four-wheel-drive vehicles with solid front and rear axles. These axles are known for their durability, strength, and articulation. New Wranglers come with a Dana 44 rear differential and a Dana 30 <b>front</b> <b>differential.</b> The upgraded Rubicon model of the JK Wrangler is equipped with electronically activated locking differentials, Dana 44 axles front and rear with 4.10 gears, a 4:1 transfer case, electronic sway bar disconnect and heavy duty suspension.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} B5 {{version was}} produced {{only as a}} five-door five-seat [...] "Avant", Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon. [...] The second version, the B7, was released initially as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan, with the Avant following a short while later. [...] A two-door four-seat Cabriolet version was subsequently added. [...] Furthermore, their unique internal combustion engines are all front-mounted, and are longitudinally oriented. [...] The transmission is mounted immediately {{at the rear of}} the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and contains both a center and <b>front</b> <b>differential.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The AMC Eagle was {{the first}} {{production}} car to use the complete [...] "Ferguson Formula" [...] (FF) full-time all-wheel-drive system from Britain's Ferguson Research. Other four-wheel-drive automobile-type vehicles - the Subaru DL/GL (1972 for the Japanese domestic market {{and two years later}} in the U.S.), and much later the Toyota Tercel SR5 Wagon (1983) - only had part-time four-wheel-drive systems that could not be engaged on dry pavement. The Eagle was also years ahead of Subaru's simplistic, part-time front-drive/4WD system, due to Roy Lunn's creativity and Jeep's experience producing 4WD vehicles. Another feature was the Eagle's independent front suspension, accomplished by mounting the <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> to the engine block with universal joints and half shafts to drive the front wheels.|$|E

2500|$|The car {{was still}} present {{at all the}} {{remaining}} races as a spare, and at Silverstone Jean-Pierre Beltoise gave the car its first race and came home ninth, six laps behind Stewart's two-wheel drive Matra (but three laps ahead of Miles's Lotus 63). By {{the next time the}} car raced, the <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> had been disconnected and the car effectively ran as an over-weight MS80 with inboard front brakes, memorably giving the lie to Johnny Servoz-Gavin's protestations about the 4WD car being [...] "undriveable" [...] after he finished the Canadian Grand Prix six laps down in sixth place. Servoz-Gavin also drove the car at Watkins Glen, finishing 16 laps down and unclassified, and finally in Mexico, crossing the line [...] "just" [...] two laps down in eighth place.|$|E
2500|$|Trevor Taylor and Cosworth co-founder Mike Costin {{tested the}} car extensively, {{the first problem}} being the {{positioning}} of the oil tank, which for weight distribution had been placed directly behind the driver's backside, causing considerable discomfort. With the oil tank moved back behind the engine and a redesign of the front driveshafts the only major remaining problem was the excessive understeer which dogged all the 4WD cars. A limited-slip <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> was tried with some slight success, but after Jackie Stewart briefly sampled the car reporting that [...] "the car's so heavy on the front, you turn into a corner and whole thing starts driving you", confirming what Taylor and Costin already felt, Hayes withdrew his support and the Cosworth 4WD project was axed shortly before the British Grand Prix.|$|E
5000|$|Both IFS 100 and Live-axle 105 {{models have}} been {{reported}} as suffering from broken <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> centres when driven in harsh conditions. The most common <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> failures in IFS models are reported in vehicles produced between mid-1997 and mid-1999 (i.e. the model years 1998 and 1999), when Toyota fitted the 100 Series IFS with a 2-pinion <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> (the pinion gear would flex away from the ring gear under shock loads).

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the <b>front</b> <b>differential,</b> rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, <b>front</b> <b>differential,</b> center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the <b>front</b> <b>differential).</b> The <b>front</b> <b>differential</b> distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|E

50|$|For all manual {{transmission}} models except Previa, and the 1988 and newer Celica, {{there is a}} small button inside the vehicle labelled Center Diff. Lock and when activated, the transfer case locks, resulting in the power distribution to be 50/50 between the front and rear of the vehicle. The wheels themselves are not always going the same speed because there are still the open front and open rear differentials allowing for differences in wheels speed from left to right. The final result of this is that if the vehicle is in a situation where traction is uneven or poor (i.e. muddy or snowy), all four wheels will have power transmitted to them, allowing the vehicle to use the wheels that still have traction to move the car. However, due to the open rear and <b>front</b> <b>differentials,</b> if the road conditions are very slick the wheels with the least amount of traction will still spin at a faster rate then those that do have traction.|$|R
