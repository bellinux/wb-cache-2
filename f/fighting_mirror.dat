40|$|Fish act aggressively {{towards their}} mirror image {{suggesting}} that they consider it another individual, whereas in some mammals behavioural response to mirrors may be an evidence of self-recognition. Since fish cannot self-recognize, we asked whether they could distinguish between <b>fighting</b> a <b>mirror</b> image and <b>fighting</b> a real fish. We compared molecular, physiological and behavioural responses in each condition and found large differences in brain gene expression levels. Although neither levels of aggressive behaviour nor circulating androgens differed between these conditions, males <b>fighting</b> a <b>mirror</b> image had higher immediate early gene (IEG) expression in brain areas homologous to the amygdala and hippocampus than controls. Since amygdalar responses are associated with fear and fear conditioning in other species, higher levels of brain activation when <b>fighting</b> a <b>mirror</b> suggest fish experience fear in response to fights with a mirror image. Clearly, the fish recognize something unusual about the mirror image and the differential brain response may reflect a cognitive distinction...|$|R

50|$|During the battle, Miho {{mistakes}} Shinji as Ryuga. She treats him to dinner, claiming Shinji {{saved her}} life and assisted her in getting {{a step closer to}} winning the Rider war with Shinji unsure of her sudden kind attitude to her. While in the bathroom, the mirror Shinji enters, and disguised as the real one, tries to throw Miho off the roof of a building. As she realizes that he is not Shinji, he reveals himself as Ryuga, and Miho transforms to Femme to fight him. Ren as Kamen Rider Knight and <b>fighting</b> another <b>Mirror</b> Monster, notices Ryuga and Femme fighting, mistaking Ryuga to be Shinji. Femme is mortally wounded, but saved by Shinji as Ryuki who then catches a glimpse of his own mirror doppelganger before Ryuga leaves. After leaving the Mirror World, Shinji and Miho share a final moment together, before Miho dies from her wounds.|$|R
50|$|One of his {{assignments}} {{takes him}} to Beirut, where {{the chaos of}} the latest <b>fighting</b> seems to <b>mirror</b> his own inner turmoil. While tracking a German militant named Britta, who had been involved with an Irish terrorist called Seamus, his first stop is a brief research post with a well-mannered officer named Giles Latimer. Despite his good nature and popularity, it is revealed that Giles had suffered a nervous breakdown and hid dozens of confidential files out of shame and guilt he felt towards a young girl he had fallen in love with.|$|R

After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff {{for several years and}} helps him build a floating restaurant, the [...] Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based <b>fighting</b> style. <b>Mirroring</b> Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and when fighting only uses his legs, to protect the hands he needs to cook.

Peckinpah lets off a terrible scream and charges Allen, and they burst into ferocious fighting. As they fight, their images begin to blur, until they resemble a <b>mirror</b> <b>fighting</b> its own image. The Human then turns and notices the walls of the church are engulfed in flame, set alight by the church's candles. The Human's focus shifts back to the fighting pieces of himself, and when they begin to drown out even the flaming church, the Human realizes that he is ignoring even himself in this situation. He's not living the life he wants to live.|$|R
50|$|Another fight scene, between Margolin and Sally Kemp {{playing the}} role of an Amazon housemistress, was notable for taking place in front of Kemp's children. The fight ended with the dark haired Margolin {{bringing}} her blonde opponent to her knees, unaware that the children were watching until they stepped forward, crying. Margolin, embarrassed, released Kemp and apologized to the children for <b>fighting</b> their mother.This <b>mirrors</b> a scene in Genesis II in which the shock wave from a nuclear explosion Hunt has triggered strikes on a Pax lookout just as a mother has brought her young children out to see the stars. There and in the Planet Earth scene, the heroes witness the effect of their own violence on children, forcing them to rethink the use of force—a very effective and intelligent pacifistic touch from Roddenberry.|$|R
50|$|After the Great War many Irish {{soldiers}} {{returned home}} to find their country {{on the brink of}} internecine conflict. The fear of reprisals at first restrained the use of physical force in retaliation. But much of the philosophical grounding in support for revolution was articulated through the refounded universities. Frenchman and professor at National University of Dublin, Dr. Roger Chauviré, using the pseudonym, Sylvain Briollay, expressed the dominant colours of Ireland as an abstraction of the French revolutionary tri-couleur. D. P. Moran had long been a nationalist thinker and writer, who supported the use of force, as a transience from Anglo-Irish ascendancy towards a gaelic identity. The Abbey Theatre was another arena for expression outwith the plays of James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, and Lady Gregory. But perhaps the most pugilistic was the Marxist-inspired The Plough and the Stars and existentialist Juno and the Paycock both penned by Seán O'Casey. The active discussion of physical <b>fighting</b> on stage <b>mirrored</b> actual events on the streets, almost as they were happening. Unequivocally stated the nationalism was overtly gaelic in language and perception. And through the convenient medium of acting, women became supported in rights, {{even to the point of}} soldiery. Constance Markievicz's heroism was marked by an historic physicality engaged with audiences on stage and in front of Mountjoy Prison. Manning the Dublin Barricades, she joined others, including the actress Maud Gonne, who married an IRA soldier.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{military}} accessories in XVIth century Poland {{in the light}} of historiographical relations, that is things and matters connected with an army, military services (an emphasis was put on accessories used by a soldier). The study is based on two works by L. Górnicki Dworzanin polski and Dzieje w Koronie Polskiej. Ł. Górnicki (1527 - 1603) was a courtier of bishops S. Maciejowski and A. Zebrzydowski, an envoy to Vienna and even a secretary of king Sigismund 11 August. Weapon knowledge systematics was preserved in the work, that is a division into offensive and defensive weapon and military equipment. Among offensive weapon L. Górnicki mentioned sabres which became more and more popular in XVlth century in Poland. It is worth mentioning that both swords and knives producers were applying for the right to produce the sabres. Another offensive weapon was a "hauswehre” - sword numbered by the contemporary of those days, just like a sabre, among fighting knives. This kind of weapon was cheap and easily available. Ł. Górnicki described an unfortunate accident which took place during a shooting show and in the time of Sigismund II August s visit at Prussian duke’s. In this description the author mentioned a sephelin. It was as a short spear with a big spearhead and spearshaft bound with leather bands. There is also a remark on trench mortars and problems faced by gunner who obviously did not know parabolic theory of bullet lead. Górnicki described also several tournaments organized at the king's court, for instance the one in 1533 or in 1539. It is possible to find not only descriptions of tournament customs (e. g. hasliludium hussaronicum) but also armament, mainly protective. Górnicki also noticed personal participation of Sigismund II August in knights’ struggles and he described <b>fighting</b> horses, which <b>mirrors</b> the role of horses in life of noblemen especially an army in Renaissance Poland. It was emphasized that people risked their life to capture horses which was frequently criticized but not abandoned. Ł. Gôrnicki’s account can be highly valued especially that he himself was for many years a courtier and a secretary of Sigismund II August so he knew the described reality very well. Historiographical sources - in contrast to economic sources - remark not only on the object itself but they also place it in a cultural context, which expands our knowledge of material culture history and historical weapon knowledge.
