2500|$|However, {{these plans}} proved too ambitious and were {{subsequently}} aborted. Central {{to the implementation}} of the plan was the adoption of moving block signalling, which had never been proven on anything more than simple metro lines and light rail systems – not on a complex high-speed heavy-rail network such as the WCML. Despite this, Railtrack made what would prove to be the fatal mistake of not properly assessing the technical viability and cost of implementing moving block prior to promising the speed increase to Virgin and the government. By 1999, with little headway on the modernisation project made, it became apparent to engineers that the technology was not mature enough to be used on the line. The bankruptcy of Railtrack in 2001 and its replacement by Network Rail following the Hatfield crash brought a reappraisal of the plans, while the cost of the upgrade soared. Following fears that cost overruns on the project would push the final price tag to £13billion, the plans were scaled down, bringing the cost down to between £8billion and £10billion, to be ready by 2008, with a maximum speed <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> of a more modest [...] – equalling the speeds available on the East Coast route, but some way short of the original target, and even further behind BR's original vision of [...] speeds planned and achieved with the APT.|$|E

50|$|A tender for {{electrification}} of the Tehran-Mashhad {{double track}} line, would supply 70 electric locomotives with cab signaling {{that will increase}} the speed to 200 km/h for passenger car trains and 250 km/h <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> like Talgo.|$|E
50|$|Reconstruction {{work has}} {{started on the}} Warsaw-Gdańsk line to allow speeds up to 200 km/h <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> This {{initially}} allows trains to run to ETCS Level 1 standards with a commitment but no timetable for further upgrades to ETCS Level 2 standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{track is}} not electrified, {{except for the}} short section between Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof and Magdeburg-Buckau. It has {{duplicated}} sections from Hadmersleben to shortly before Oschersleben and between Krottorf and Groß Quenstedt. The section between Halberstadt and Wegeleben is also duplicated, {{as part of the}} upgrading of the Halle-Halberstadt railway <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> operations.

50|$|The initial Czech order <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> {{was placed}} with Fiat Ferroviaria during 2000. As {{part of the}} Alstom take over of Fiat Ferroviaria the order was changed to Pendolino trains. The first set was {{delivered}} in 2004 as Pendolino ČD 680.|$|E
50|$|Eurobalises {{have also}} been used in Germany to {{transmit}} tilting instructions for curves to tilting trains while keeping the traditional train protection system. The original GNT (Geschwindigkeitsüberwachung Neigetechnik) from Siemens had used specific coupling coils in 1992 (ZUB 122) and it was switched to Eurobalises in 2005 (ZUB 262). The additional telegram packet types <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> {{have been added to}} the Baseline 3 series of ETCS.|$|E
50|$|Track {{unbalanced}} superelevation (cant deficiency) in the United States {{is restricted}} to 75 mm, though 102 mm is permissible by waiver. The maximum value for European railways varies by country, {{some of which have}} curves with over 280 mm of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation. The highest values are only <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains,</b> because it would be too uncomfortable for passengers in conventional train cars.|$|E
50|$|GNER {{placed a}} trial order <b>for</b> two <b>tilting</b> <b>trains,</b> based on Italian Pendolino technology, these trains {{were due to}} arrive in the early 2000s, but the order was cancelled, and therefore, no Pendolinos were used by GNER.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} based on Eurobalises to {{transmit}} an additional set of speed restrictions {{on top of the}} Automatic Warning System (AWS) or Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS).

50|$|The {{route is}} {{classified}} as a main line railway and has two tracks for its whole length. Electrification of the line was completed on 11 December 1970. It {{is classified as}} track class D4, which allows axle loads of 22.5 t and a linear load of 8.0 t/m.The entire route is equipped with the Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung (PZB 90) train control system and the Geschwindigkeitsüberwachung Neigetechnik (GNT) speed monitoring system <b>for</b> <b>Tilting</b> <b>trains</b> (ZUB 262).|$|E
5000|$|The {{second stage}} {{involves}} {{the extension of}} duplication for 160 km / h <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> and the electrification of the line. This is classified as an [...] "additional requirement" [...] and {{was not included in}} the five-year plan (2006 to 2010). The single-track sections between Weimar and Großschwabhausen and between Neue Schenke and Stadtroda are due to be duplicated by 2014. The expansion plans and further prospects continue to be debated and are highly politicised.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{timetable}} change in December 2007, the international long-distance services between Frankfurt and Vienna have been operated in cooperation between DB and ÖBB using ICE T trains with tilting technology only. Curves on the Western Railway between Wels and Vienna line were improved {{to reduce the}} journey time <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> between Frankfurt and Vienna. Apart from day services, the line is still used by an overnight train, which runs from Vienna to Hamburg, with a portion running to Cologne.|$|E
50|$|In August 1999 a {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Walkers <b>for</b> two diesel <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> to operate services from Brisbane to Cairns. In contrast to the Electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train,</b> the diesel <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> is a push-pull locomotive based train, although the two are externally similar.|$|R
50|$|After modernisation, {{at a cost}} of €4M, and {{expansion}} during 2000 and 2001 as the depot <b>for</b> the <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> of classes 612 and 605 (the latter until its withdrawal in December 2003), the future of the depot was secured. Today the Betriebswerk is the main base for DB Regio Oberfranken and the home for 45 Class 612 and 27 Class 628 units (as at 2007).|$|R
40|$|Carbody tilting {{is today}} a mature and {{inexpensive}} technology allowing higher speeds in curves and thus reduced travel time. The technology is accepted by many train operators. Today {{more than 5000}} tilting vehicles, defined as tilting carbodies, have been produced world-wide by different suppliers. <b>Tilting</b> <b>trains</b> {{can be divided into}} naturally <b>tilted</b> <b>trains</b> and actively <b>tilted</b> <b>trains.</b> However, also natural tilting will often include actuation to ensure satisfactory dynamic performance. The mechanical solutions <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> involving pendulums or rollers are well proven. They have also become compact enough to avoid passenger area intrusion. The proportion of the lateral acceleration compensated by tilt has decreased over the years. In the early days of <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> development, it was often assumed that the compensation should be 100 %. Compensation of 50 – 70 % are typically used in today's actively <b>tilting</b> <b>trains,</b> while natural <b>tilting</b> ones still retain compensation close to 100 %. Recent developments in control have provided the market with more clever systems erasing the former problem with time delays. The result is beneficial for both ride comfort and low risk of motion sickness. As an example, running time simulations on the Swedish mainline Stockholm–Gothenburg have shown that the running time benefit <b>for</b> a <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> vs. a non-tilting train, both with a top speed 275 km/h, is about 10 %...|$|R
50|$|In order <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> to be operated, Railtrack was {{committed}} to upgrade the West Coast Main Line to allow 140 mph operation by 2005. In {{the wake of the}} collapse of Railtrack and the inability of successor Network Rail to deliver on the upgrade, the franchise was suspended in favour of a management contracts in July 2002. Due to costs having blown out from £2.5 billion to £10 billion there were cutbacks to the upgrade and the top speed reduced to 125 mph.|$|E
50|$|Despite an {{agreement}} between Deutsche Bahn {{and the state of}} Thuringia of 15 May 1997 for the partial double-tracking of the line and upgrading of the line <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains,</b> a decision had already been taken that year to discontinue long-distance services on the line. The reason was a decision of Deutsche Bahn to abandon InterRegio traffic nationwide. In 1999, two years before the closing of long distance passenger services in 2001, scheduled freight traffic was closed between Gera and Weimar on the Mid-German Connection.|$|E
50|$|Memmingen {{station in}} the city of Memmingen in the German state of Bavaria. The current station {{building}} had two predecessors, with the original being opened in 1862. The Buchloe-Memmingen and the Leutkirch-Memmingen railways meet the Neu-Ulm-Kempten railway (Iller Valley Railway) in Memmingen. The route from Munich to Zurich through Memmingen station is planned to be upgraded <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> and electrified. The station is designed to be accessible. For some time various parties have sought another railway stop at Schulzentrum West (school centre west) for about 3,500 students.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows the}} {{experimental}} study {{to evaluate the}} fatigue strength of a bogie frame <b>for</b> Korean <b>tilting</b> <b>train.</b> The various load cases were established based on the international standard (UIC 615 - 4) and the special tilting load case, which is unique in the <b>tilting</b> <b>train,</b> was derived by dynamic analysis and logical assumption of operation under worst tilting condition. The experimental study was conducted by means of two ways, both static and fatigue loading test. Through the static load test, the safety against fatigue was assessed using Goodman diagram of the material used. The fatigue load test was carried out up to 1 x 10 7 cycles. The fatigue strength was assessed by fatigue crack inspection by means of NDT test at the stage of 6 x 10 6 cycles and 1 x 10 7 cycles...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} divided in two main parts, the first, {{chapters}} 2 to 7, covers knowledge {{found in the}} literature study. The two first chapters in the literature study give a description of concept of, and a state of the art report on, <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> Development trends are identified and reported. The next two chapters report on track and the interaction between track and vehicle. Cross-wind stability is identified as critical <b>for</b> high-speed <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> and limitation of allowed cant deficiency may be needed, reducing the benefit of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> at very high speed. The second last chapter in the literature study deals with motion sickness, which may be important for the competitiveness of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> However, reduced risk of motion sickness may be contradictory to comfort, one can not be considered without also considering the other. The last chapter in the literature study report on winter problems connected to tilt and/or high speed, which essentially can be divided in ballast stone lift and snow packing. The mechanism of stone lift is described and countermeasures are identified. Snow packing on <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> is reported to have a relation to safety critical issues that must be mitigated. Chapters 8 to 10 covers analysis made within this study with the aim to identify areas where research can improve the competitiveness of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> Alternativ URL: [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|From 2003 to September 2007 {{platforms}} and level crossings were modernised and rail tracks and signalling systems were renewed {{along the entire}} route for a total cost of around € 75 million. In November 2006, the last semaphore signal on the Brenz railway {{was taken out of}} service, the electronic interlocking at Heidenheim controls the line from Oberkochen until Thalfingen (near Ulm).

5000|$|The Rennsteig {{road tunnel}} which was opened on 5 July 2003 crosses above Brandleite tunnel about 350 m from its western end at a {{vertical}} distance of 5 ... 6.5 m. The effects of its construction, in particular {{on the water}} circulation and the upgrade of the railway line <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> were reasons to rehabilitate the aging tunnel during 11 months in 2004/2005, taking significantly longer than the originally planned 5 months. On this occasion, the traditional tracks and trackbed were replaced by ballastless track in an asphalt bed.|$|E
50|$|Deutsche Bahn {{developed}} the ICE 3, IC T and ICT-VT projects in parallel. The trains share a general styling concept, notably a lounge {{section in the}} front separated only by a glass wall from the driver's compartment, with a view forward over the tracks. Technically, the trains share a lot of components and technical layout, {{as well as the}} concept of distributed traction: in contrast to the ICE 1 and ICE 2 designs, the new units were planned not with power cars, but with peripheral underfloor motors, to reduce axle load (important <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains)</b> and increase tractive effort.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, the {{majority}} of passenger services were changed to operate with class 628.2 diesel multiple units, which were then new. Uerdingen railbus and class 627.0 diesel multiple units were used on individual scheduled services until 1997. Class 215 diesel locomotives were used {{only for a few}} passenger services and were becoming less and less used for freight transport. The last scheduled locomotive-hauled service on the line between Tübingen and Sigmaringen operated on 31 May 1997. In subsequent years, however, locomotive-hauled trains were repeatedly used for extended periods as a replacement <b>for</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> that could not be operated.|$|E
5000|$|The RABDe 500 (often nicknamed ICN for Intercity-Neigezug, German <b>for</b> Intercity <b>Tilting</b> <b>Train,</b> {{the train}} {{category}} for which these trains are used), is a Swiss passenger train which {{was introduced in}} 2000, in time for Expo.02 held in western Switzerland in 2002. Its maximum speed is 200 km/h, which can be reached on the Mattstetten-Rothrist new line; however, [...] the RABDe 500 is not currently used on this line, except on the branch to Solothurn. It was a joint development by Bombardier, Swiss Federal Railways and Alstom, with an aerodynamic body designed by Pininfarina. Forty-four RABDe 500 trains {{with a total of}} 308 coaches were delivered to SBB-CFF-FFS between 1999 and 2005.|$|R
2500|$|The InterCity 125 {{was planned}} as a stop gap measure, meant to fill until {{electrification}} was spread across all main {{lines and the}} Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was in service.
