5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age, therefore she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops {{many times over the}} course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E

25|$|Mr Malcolm Wilson (Matthew Woolcott) - A trainee bank {{manager who}} stayed in Bodger's hotel in Series 9. Like {{most of the}} characters, he too despises mashed potato as he is {{involved}} in an unfortunately large amount incidents where he ends up covered in it. In one episode he even accidentally tasted it in his cereal. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cry-baby, who gets upset over the slightest things, {{one of the most}} notable being when he is late for a job interview after Mrs Melly confiscates his clothes while he is swimming in the sea.|$|E
500|$|On {{a similar}} list, the Los Angeles Times ranked it at number 69, {{explaining}} [...] "this isn't a bad episode. Like most Hurley episodes, {{it features a}} lot of very sweet, funny material. But it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> time killer between two really fantastic hours." [...] The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating and stated that [...] "it's enough for me. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get Lost again." ...|$|E

It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that {{if she were in}} trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had {{to take a step back}} and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be quite what has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{novel was}} widely popular {{and led to}} García Márquez's Nobel Prize {{as well as the}} Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972. William Kennedy has called it [...] "the first piece of {{literature}} since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race," [...] and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it. Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: [...] "Most critics don't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke, full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|In AJ's first episode, {{he makes}} {{an enemy of}} Derek Branning when he and Masood crash a {{shopping}} trolley into his car. An insider said that AJ should be worried, explaining: [...] "AJ <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> talker and tries to blag {{his way out of}} the situation but that just makes things even worse. Derek is quick to rough him up a little to make him realise he's not to be messed with. The confrontation really shocks AJ but he's not going to be pushed around by some bullying bloke he's just met." [...] The Daily Star said that [...] "Derek is the one person AJ really shouldn't make into an enemy", while interviewer Phillip Schofield stated: [...] "If you knock the wing mirror off Derek's Jag you are in for trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the melodies on Get to Heaven {{originated}} from Robertshaw's guitar, though he recalled to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would occasionally approach {{the rest of}} the group with [...] "an insane laptop creation" [...] which would have to be translated to work as a group. Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track [...] "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single [...] "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> signature for the new record...

500|$|Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor gave [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] {{a rating}} of three-and-a-half out of five and found its musical climax [...] "admittedly satisfying—that is, until it resumes {{flailing}} like a novelty track", writing that [...] "it's {{not hard to see}} why the track is well-liked, but its snowballing ubiquity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> head-scratcher, simply because it's not all that interesting." [...] Similarly, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that, after hearing a minute of it being played during Power 105.1 FM's mixshow, the song [...] "felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy." [...] Caramanica felt that its success, along with that of Macklemore's 2012 song [...] "Thrift Shop", reflects a [...] "centerless future" [...] for hip hop and stated, [...] "Depending on your lens, this reflects a tremendous cultural victory for hip-hop or the moment when hip-hop, as a construct, begins to lose meaning." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Eclipse Part I", she and Sylar {{are sent}} to {{retrieve}} Claire who is revealed to be the catalyst, the unknown part of the formula that would allow someone to produce abilities. On assignment, Elle challenges Sylar and he shows her that he can still be a killer, {{and not just a}} [...] "daddy's boy" [...] by killing a rental car assistant. Eventually, they find Claire and Noah, and a fight ensues, however, Elle and Sylar find themselves powerless; the result of the eclipse. Elle aims a gun at Noah but Claire jumps in and takes the bullet. Noah knocks Elle out and dislocates Sylar's arm, while he escapes with injured Claire. After awakening, Sylar explains to a shocked Elle that losing his abilities <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relief. She tells him that they can't just take what they want anymore, then Sylar retorts and grabs Elle, kissing her passionately. Outside, Noah aims a rifle at them.|$|E
500|$|Singh {{described}} {{the role of}} Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior {{to the release of}} the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star {{and the fact that the}} female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an [...] "almost-forgotten" [...] actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was [...] "pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duffer when it comes to matters of the heart. The film earned approximately [...] at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut.|$|E

500|$|The revelation ruins their relationship. The actresses shared insight: [...] "Ruby {{just wants}} to get some {{security}} back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air"; whilst Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap" [...] The events impact Ruby's self-identity, leaving her feeling confused and her backstory succumb the distortion Charlie causes. Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now with everything?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?". Breeds {{said it was a}} [...] "big exploration" [...] and [...] "a journey" [...] for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She said that ultimately everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> journey." ...|$|E
500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four games last year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, like last year, PSU <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{said the}} episode started strong {{with the fire}} scare scene, but [...] "tapered off into a disjointed plot" [...] that she felt would not win new viewers. She said many jokes went too long and lost momentum, but {{nevertheless}} wrote [...] "a lot of the episode’s humor was engaging and smart". Lorenzo Perez of The News & Observer said the Pam subplot was [...] "overworked" [...] and lacked impact, and the Dwight character was over-the-top, proving The Office writers clearly {{have no idea how}} to rein in Dwight Schrute. Perez also expressed doubt the show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into the night following the Super Bowl. However, Perez said he enjoyed the Black/Leachman cameos. Terry Morrow of the Knoxville News Sentinel said, [...] "This particular visit to The Office doesn't pop like most episodes". Morrow praised the Black/Leachman film, but said, [...] "To be upstaged by a B-plot, one not involving the show's main characters at all, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misdirection the show doesn't need in a post-Super Bowl time slot." [...] USA Today critic Robert Bianco said the plot was extremely thin and the Black and Leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque. Bianco wrote, [...] "Unfortunately, in an hour you get at most a handful of funny moments. So if you want funny from a comedy, look elsewhere." ...|$|E
