5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the <b>employment</b> <b>rate.</b> Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the <b>employment</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} <b>employment</b> <b>rate</b> and a {{relatively}} low unemployment level. The overall unemployment rate is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are unemployment hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. Unemployment levels tend to fluctuate {{over the course of}} the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's <b>employment</b> <b>rate</b> between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E

Almost 600 commute each day, with the average journey to work being 12.5miles (20.18km). The 2001 census revealed that of 1,186people questioned aged 16–74, 722 were economically active, with men working an average of 44.8hours each week and women an average of 31.2. The service industry was the largest sector of the local economy, employing 67% of all workers, compared to 1841 when 48% worked in agriculture. Manufacturing work {{was carried out by}} 178people in 2001 and 565 were in the service industries. Of these workers, 371 were classed as managerial and professional. In 1841, just 16.6% of male workers had middle class jobs, but the 2001 census showed this figure had increased to 47.9%.|$|E

30|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>rates</b> for {{native-born}} {{women in}} Sweden increased during the 1970 s and 1980 s and, {{since the beginning}} of the 1990 s, have been almost as high as <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> for men. In contrast, <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> among foreign-born men and women dropped rapidly during the deep recession Sweden experienced during the first half of the 1990 s and were more greatly affected than those of natives. As a consequence, the gap in <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> and annual earnings between foreign-born and native-born individuals widened rapidly during those years (Ekberg and Hammarstedt 2002; Hammarstedt and Shukur 2007). Since then, low employment among foreign-born individuals in Sweden has become a great challenge for policymakers and has attracted much public attention.|$|R
30|$|A second {{question}} {{of great interest}} to us is whether the increase in immigration has brought about regional convergence in <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> by attracting migrants to regions with higher <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> versus regions with lower <b>employment</b> <b>rates.</b> As discussed earlier in the paper, much of the Spanish unemployment can be classified as structural unemployment arising from regional imbalances in labor demand and supply. This type of unemployment could be significantly reduced via immigrants’ greater responsiveness to employment opportunities in specific regions.|$|R

Regressions of either private-sector <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> or unemployment rates on two measures of public-sector employment point to full crowding out. This means that high <b>rates</b> of public <b>employment,</b> which incur substantial fiscal costs, have a large negative impact on private <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> and do not reduce overall unemployment rates...|$|R

25|$|Currently, Mexican Americans {{constitute}} {{the largest percentage}} of second-generation immigrants in the United States. Among male high school graduates, the employment rates are comparable to those experienced by native born whites. When location is controlled for, the <b>employment</b> <b>rate</b> of Mexican American second-generation immigrants surpasses that of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Among male Mexican American second-generation immigrants who have less than a high school diploma, employment rates are also higher than those of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Mexican second generation women experience an <b>employment</b> <b>rate</b> slightly below that of native whites. This gap in labor participation increases for those with less than a high school diploma. Similar levels of labor force participation does not necessarily mean similar earnings, as part-time is considered employment and Mexican Americans are more likely to take on jobs with lower pay.|$|E

Propensity scores {{are used to}} examine both weighted and un-weighted logistic regression models. Logistic regression models indicate that inmate participation in employment programming during a term of incarceration increases <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> for females at nine and fifteen months after their release but does not increase <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> for males. In addition, participation in employment programming during a term of incarceration does not significantly reduce re-arrest rates among either gender. However, participation in community based employment programming significantly increases <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> among females at three and nine months following their release and significantly increases male <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> at three, nine, and fifteen months after their release. Participation in community based employment programming following a term of incarceration significantly reduced re-arrest rates among both genders for the time periods examined.

30|$|Given {{that most}} often workers face {{the choice of}} working {{full-time}} or no time (retirement), the constraint in hours of work may influence the labour force participation decision.

In the European Union, older workers are already over-represented in part-time employment and Member States, like Sweden, with higher shares of older workers in part-time employment tend to present higher <b>employment</b> <b>rates</b> for the 55 - 64 age group.
