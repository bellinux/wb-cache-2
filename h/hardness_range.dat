50|$|A typical {{feature of}} the Palatinate Forest is its {{abundance}} of water, {{that has led to}} a highly developed system of streams, rivers and wetlands (see below). The sandy soils caused by erosion are very very permeable to water, so that rainwater quickly seeps into the ground and is then stored in the different rock zones as groundwater that can be channeled by the joints and fissure ("fissure flow"). This groundwater feeds into various rock zones, especially in the Trifels beds of the Lower Bunter and in a rock zone of the Karlstal beds (Middle Bunter). Beds of clay-bonded sandstone form spring horizons, where it is discharged at the surface again e.g. in contact springs. Since the sandstone is very low in minerals and the groundwater, therefore, only has only low levels of dissolved contents, the water is in the low <b>hardness</b> <b>range</b> ("soft") and is slightly acidic (low pH).|$|E

Wheels in heavy haul service in Australia are generally specified to the AAR requirements [13], with the most commonly used grades being the Class B with a rim <b>hardness</b> <b>range</b> of 302 – 341  HB and the Class C with a rim <b>hardness</b> <b>range</b> of 321 – 363  HB.

The most recent amendments to the AAR standard include provision for an even harder wheel grade (Class D, 341 – 415  HB), with composition complying with the requirements for Class C wheels. Mixed pearlite/bainite can already exist in Class C wheels; more aggressive quenching conditions used to manufacture Class D wheels can result in wheels which exhibit more extensive regions of non-pearlitic microstructure than are typically present in current wheels.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Standard {{elastomeric}} formulations {{are based}} on three compo-nents: a) diisocyanates such as TDI, MDI and NDI b) polyols with an ester, ether, and/or carbonate backbone c) chain extenders that are reactive glycols or aromatic diamines Such standard formulations were subjected to dynamic tests to determine their relative load bearing capacities (constant load testing methods were gen-erally used). These results could be correlated {{to a certain extent}} with rou-tinely measured mechanical properties. The behavior of materials chain extended with aromatic diamines (polyurea urethanes) was somewhat different from the glycol-extended systems. The poly-urea urethanes have a high softening temperature, show little thermoplasticity and a relatively high set after testing. Glycol-extended systems showed rela-tively little set after deformation, but the softening temperature of such elas-tomers are relatively low.
