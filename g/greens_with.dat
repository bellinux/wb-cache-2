25|$|The next {{election}} in 1996 saw Labor regain three seats and the Greens lose one. Ray Groom, who had promised {{before the election}} to only govern with a majority, resigned and handed the leadership to Tony Rundle, who formed a loose alliance with the Greens to govern in a minority until 1998, when the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly (from 35 to 25 seats) in an (ultimately, unsuccessful) attempt {{to make it more}} difficult for minor parties to be elected.

[...] She was especially noted for her ability to effectively incorporate functional areas such as tennis courts and putting <b>greens</b> <b>with</b> ornamental areas such as allées. Her willingness to innovate made her a particularly sought-after designer as clients came to value a more adventurous approach to landscape architecture. She put into practice the idea put forward in 1918 by Elsa Rehmann that a garden should be a [...] "manifestation of distinctive individuality, an expression of personality."

[...] Asian mustard greens are most often stir-fried or pickled. A Southeast Asian dish called asam gai choy or kiam chai boey is often made with leftovers from a large meal.

2500|$|The glaze colours vary {{across a}} wide {{spectrum}} of greyish to blueish <b>greens,</b> <b>with</b> some yellowish browns as well. The colour comes from iron oxide fired in a reducing atmosphere, and the colour varies with the temperature and the strength and timing of the reduction. Longquan celadon was fired in long dragon kilns, brick tunnels rising up a slope, with a series of chambers, and the best results came from the pots in the uppermost stages, which heated up more slowly and evenly. Saggars were always used, and the longer kilns, with up to twelve chambers, {{might have been able to}} fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time. The firing temperature was probably between 1,180°C and 1,280°C, with the range over 1,250°C giving the best green or blue colours. [...] In some cases at least there appear to have been layers of glaze and also multiple firings to achieve a deeper glaze effect.|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} five {{different}} ship camouflage schemes were employed on the Captains. The ships {{came from the}} shipyards in white with light blue polygons, the US Navy's camouflage pattern for northern latitudes. [...] For those ships assigned to the North Atlantic, a scheme consisting {{of light and dark}} blues and <b>greens</b> <b>with</b> some soft white was adopted as it was believed that this would blend with the sea colour in bad weather. Ships assigned to the English Channel in 1944 (Coastal Forces control frigates and those assigned to Operation Neptune as headquarters ships) received a design in black, blue, light grey and white. For ships assigned to the 16th Flotilla (Harwich) and 21st Flotilla (Sheerness) operating in the North Sea and English Channel, a scheme consisting of horizontal upper deck divisions of light and dark grey (as used by the US Navy) was used. Early in 1945, a scheme was adopted that was to be common to all Royal Navy ships, consisting of white with a sky-blue stripe along the hull.|$|E

2500|$|The title [...] "The Greens" [...] {{had been}} first {{registered}} in Sydney in the 1980s by what The Monthly Magazine described as [...] "a band of inner-city radicals committed to resident action, nuclear disarmament and urban environmental causes, such as stopping expressways and preserving parklands". The group formed as the Sydney Greens and {{evolved into the}} Green Alliance, with the stated aim of not forming a [...] "traditional hierarchy party". According to party co-ordinator Hall Greenland, when amalgamation with Bob Brown's Tasmanian movement was first mooted, Brown was hesitant owing to what he perceived as the [...] "anarchic leftism" [...] of the Sydney movement. The Greens NSW and The Greens (WA) were also wary of amalgamation owing to local autonomy concerns and a 1986 attempt by Brown to form a national party failed. The movement for a national party continued however. In {{an effort to reduce}} the influence of the Democratic Socialist Party (formerly Socialist Workers Party) in The Greens NSW, Brown successfully moved for a ban on dual party membership by Greens. Following formation of the national party in 1992, regional emphasis variations remained within the <b>Greens,</b> <b>with</b> members of the [...] "industrial left" [...] remaining a presence in the New South Wales branch.|$|E

60|$|On {{reaching}} the church porch, {{we found the}} parson rebuking the gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the <b>greens</b> <b>with</b> which the church was decorated. It was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned by having {{been used by the}} Druids in their mystic ceremonies; and though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and kitchens, yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church as unhallowed, and totally unfit for sacred purposes. So tenacious was he on this point, that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great part of the humble trophies of his taste, before the parson would consent to enter upon the service of the day.|$|E

When I entered the house I was received with exquisite courtesy by Lady Hypatia and her husband; but I found much greater difficulty in actually seeing the Superman, who is now about fifteen years old, and is kept by himself in a quiet room. Even my conversation with the father and mother did not quite clear up the character of this mysterious being. Lady Hypatia, who has a pale and poignant face, and is clad in those impalpable and pathetic greys and <b>greens</b> <b>with</b> which she has brightened so many homes in Hoxton, did not appear to talk of her offspring with any of the vulgar vanity of an ordinary human mother. I took a bold step and asked if the Superman was nice looking.|$|E
