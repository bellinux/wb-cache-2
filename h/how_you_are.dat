5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

I’m curious about <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> how your health is. We are well and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E
500|$|Some {{responded to}} the {{backlash}} {{in a show of}} solidarity with Davuluri. Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me shaking my head. Please tell me I'm not alone in wondering whether we've learned anything at all." [...] University of Michigan student Munmun Khan also stated that while she doesn't like beauty pageants, she hates [...] "racism and bigotry even more [...] Not only was [...] the first Indian Miss New York, but she is now also the first Indian Miss America. All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated just because we disdain that woman's choices. As an African-American woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E

2500|$|About democracy, Obama stated that, though [...] "America {{does not}} presume {{to know what}} is best for everyone", [...] "I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> governed; {{confidence}} in {{the rule of law and}} the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose." [...] He called such freedoms [...] "human rights".|$|E
2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being where we are now, {{trying to keep a}} balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> and people around us know what we're like." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Formula of Autonomy takes {{something}} important {{from both the}} Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves thinking about your maxim {{as if it were}} an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> treating the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what she would accept as a universal law. To do this, she would test her maxims against the moral law that she has legislated. The Principle of Autonomy is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.” (4:432) Kant thinks that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the kingdom of ends. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant’s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one’s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. [...] At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.|$|E
6000|$|A brief silence {{fell upon}} that. Dr. Martineau persisted. [...] "It isn't <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> made. We {{are getting to}} {{something}} in all this. It is, I insist, a mood of <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> made. A distinctive and indicative mood." ...|$|E
