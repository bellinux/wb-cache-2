50|$|The class {{evolved in}} the 1950s from the tenders of local sail boats - these were <b>jury</b> rigged with <b>sails</b> for races between crews of sail boats moored at Rottnest. The class peaked with over 270 hulls {{registered}} with about 70 currently active (cite WA newspapers report Jan 2008).|$|R
25|$|Minotaur took Neptuno in tow at 3.30 am {{the next}} day, and at {{daylight}} work began to clear away {{the wreckage of}} battle. As the storm rose, the towline snapped, putting Neptuno in danger of running onto a lee shore and being wrecked. The battered mainmast collapsed on 22 October, smashing through the captain's cabins below the poop, crushing to death Spanish paymaster Diego de Soto as he slept, and killing one of the British prize crew. Now completely dismasted the crew struggled {{to shore up the}} decks to prevent them from collapsing, and tried to <b>jury</b> rig <b>sails.</b>|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the absence}} of the captains further acts of mutiny had taken place on the other ships. One officer was drowned; others loyal to the Batavian Republic were beaten up. The Batavian flag was torn up by the mutineers. British {{officers}} restored order with some difficulty. After the surrender the Prince visited several of the ships to receive the cheers of the mutineers. He had now hoped to take command of the surrendered fleet himself, but this was denied by the British. The crews were taken off the ships, and British prize crews sailed them to England. Only five derelict frigates lying in Den Helder were handed over to William. These were manned with volunteer crews of the old-regime Dutch navy, living in the vicinity, and under <b>jury</b> rig <b>sailed</b> to England in November. One of these frigates foundered with loss of life.|$|R
2500|$|The Wetmore was [...] {{long with}} {{a beam of}} [...] and a [...] draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four <b>jury</b> masts with <b>sails</b> for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight whalebacks, {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had anchor hoisting machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
5000|$|The Wetmore {{was built}} in 1891 as hull #112 of the American Steel Barge Company works. The Wetmore was 264 ft long with a beam of 38 ft and a 16.4 ft draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four <b>jury</b> masts with <b>sails</b> for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight whalebacks, {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had anchor hoisting machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{fighting}} in the Kwajalein Atoll finished by 3 February, Intrepid {{and the rest of}} TF 58 proceeded to launch Operation Hailstone, a major raid on the main Japanese naval base in the Central Pacific, Truk Lagoon. From 17 to 19 February, the carriers pounded Japanese forces in the lagoon, sinking two destroyers and some [...] of merchant ships. Additionally, the strikes demonstrated the vulnerability of Truk, which convinced the Japanese to avoid using it in the future. Intrepid did not emerge from the operation unscathed, however. On the night of 1718 February, a Japanese torpedo bomber scored a hit on the carrier near her stern. The torpedo struck [...] below the waterline, jamming the ship's rudder to port and flooding several compartments. Sprague was able to counteract the jammed rudder by running the port side screw at high speed while idling the starboard screw for two days until high winds overpowered the improvised steering. The crew then fashioned a <b>jury</b> rigged <b>sail</b> out of scrap canvas and hatch covers, which allowed the ship to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 24 February. Temporary repairs were effected there, after which Intrepid steamed to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for permanent repairs on 16 March, arriving there six days later.|$|R
5|$|With the {{immediate}} threat gone, Saumarez {{was able to}} direct his squadron's efforts to salvaging the battered and grounded Venerable. The calm sea and light winds aided this operation, and at 14:00, assisted by Thames and the boats of Caesar and Spencer, Venerable was once again afloat. Hood's ship was taken under tow by first Thames and then Spencer, the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18:00, the crew rigging a series of <b>jury</b> masts and <b>sails</b> to assist the process. By 08:00 on 14 July, Venerable was again able to sail independently, the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day. At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21-gun salute. Spencer, Audacious and Thames remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade, which remained in place {{until the end of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the Peace of Amiens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see you are {{too good}} a sailor by far to be cheered by any {{questionable}} hopes," [...] laughed Theriere; [...] "but you must take the will into consideration--I only wished {{to give you a}} ray of hope that might lighten your burden of apprehension. However, honestly, I do think that we may {{find a way to make}} a safe landing if the sea continues to go down as it has in the past two hours. We are not more than a league from shore, and with the <b>jury</b> mast and <b>sail</b> that the men are setting under Mr. Ward now we can work in comparative safety with a light breeze, which we should have during the afternoon. There are few coasts, however rugged they may appear at a distance, that do not offer some foothold for the wrecked mariner, and I doubt not but that we shall find this no exception to the rule." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1905, Jordan {{launched}} an apparent coverup {{of the murder}} by poisoning of Jane Stanford. While vacationing in Oahu, Stanford had suddenly died of strychnine poisoning, according to the local coronerâ€™s <b>jury.</b> Jordan then <b>sailed</b> to Hawaii, hired a physician to investigate the case, and declared she had in fact died of heart failure, a condition whose symptoms bear no relationship to those actually observed. His motive for doing {{this has been a}} subject of speculation. One possibility is that he was simply acting to protect the reputation of the university; its finances were precarious and a scandal might have damaged fundraising. He had written the president of Stanford's board of trustees offering several alternate explanations for Mrs. Stanford's death, suggesting they select whichever would be most suitable. Given that Mrs. Stanford had a difficult relationship with him and reportedly planned to remove him from his position at the university, he might have also had a personal motive to eliminate suspicions that might have swirled around an unsolved crime. Jordan's version of Mrs. Stanford's demise was largely accepted until the appearance of several publications in 2003 emphasizing the evidence that she was murdered.|$|R
