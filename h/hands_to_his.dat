5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began {{to head back to}} his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
500|$|As {{he spoke}} his final sentence, {{he brought his}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, fingers {{extended}} in imitation of thorns; amid dead silence in the Coliseum, he extended his arms, recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. [...] He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E
500|$|Behind the king, {{holding his}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, is Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk (21), another {{opponent}} of the Constitution, known for being on a Russian payroll. Below him is another {{opponent of the}} Constitution, Antoni Złotnicki (22). An anonymous [...] black-clad French royalist (23) is shown looking terrified at the scene, seeing another revolution in the making. He raises {{his hand over the}} king's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{you speak}} the truth," [...] said the workman. [...] "But it's well to make certain." [...] He raised <b>his</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> right eyebrow. The {{traveller}} at once raised <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> left eyebrow.|$|R

500|$|At half-time, the {{trainers}} found on Schulz [...] "a mass {{of black and}} blue spots". [...] His [...] "face was distorted with bumps", and there were [...] "welts {{on his back and}} groin". [...] As the second half started, Schulz insisted he felt better and went back into the game. [...] But the attack continued. [...] "Another scrimmage and two more Penn men were after him again. [...] He went into the play and for an instant, his strength came back, but it couldn't last, and it didn't.” [...] Yost finally sent in a substitute, and Schulz limped to the sideline and walked slowly away [...] "with head bowed and <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> stomach". [...] And when the [...] "rubbers" [...] removed his togs and examined him, [...] "they marveled {{that he was able to}} walk". [...] In the end, Schulz [...] "didn't say a wordbig tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it".|$|E
2500|$|Mehserle stood up, unholstered his gun, a SIG Sauer P226, {{and fired}} a shot into Grant's back. Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle {{appeared}} surprised {{and raised his}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face; according to Michael Rains, Mehserle's criminal defense attorney, several eyewitnesses described Mehserle as looking stunned. Several witnesses say Mehserle said [...] "Oh my God!" [...] several times after the shooting. Many said they saw him put his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
60|$|So the imaum {{left the}} court, and {{returned}} presently carrying two small boxes of sandalwood tied with silk and sealed, so {{like each other}} that none could tell them apart, which boxes he passed continually from <b>his</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> left and from <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> right, then gave them to Saladin.|$|R

2500|$|Trainer Keene Fitzpatrick {{walked onto}} the field to examine Curtis and quickly saw that the leg was broken. [...] In what the Detroit Free Press {{described}} as [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a football field," [...] the crowd of 1,000 sitting in the bleachers fell silent and Michigan's quarterback, Harry Workman, [...] "was seen {{to come out of}} the bunch of standing players, put his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face, and break down and weep like a child." [...] A surgeon who was in the stands came onto the field, examined Curtis, and called for an ambulance. [...] The crowd sat silently as Curtis was [...] "carefully placed on a stretcher" [...] and into the hospital wagon. [...] As the crowd finally walked slowly up State Street, the [...] "gloom was awful." [...] The Detroit Free Press wrote:"Big Joe Curtis – one of the best fellows who ever went to college – who was acknowledged to be the best tackle in the west, and who was preparing himself to play the game of his life against Pennsylvania, the last college game in which he could ever participate, and who was practically certain of recognition for the All-American team, is down and out on the eve of what was to be the great climax of his spectacular football career[...] [...] [...] 'G-L-O-O-M' spells Ann Arbor tonight." ...|$|E

60|$|He put his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mouth forthwith, and {{uttered a}} {{peculiar}} cry.|$|E
