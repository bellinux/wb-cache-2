5|$|As {{there is}} no {{definitive}} date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer <b>is</b> <b>incomplete.</b> His total bouts and results presently stand, as listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 loses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is accepted that this list <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> and more bouts could be added in future, or changed.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} for bees <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> with around 11 {{specimens}} that might possibly be Bombini, some poorly documented, had {{been described by}} 2011; some (such as Calyptapis florissantensis from Florissant, USA, and Oligoapis beskonakensis from , Turkey) dated from the Oligocene. In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus.|$|E

5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|In Mahoning County, {{the route}} {{becomes part of}} the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes {{concurrent}} with I-80 few miles later. Here, most of the route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 <b>is</b> <b>incomplete,</b> with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from {{around the base of the}} Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods <b>is</b> <b>incomplete,</b> with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E

5|$|The Battles of Lexington and Concord {{initiated}} the American Revolutionary War and were {{fought in the}} eponymous Massachusetts towns. Future President George Washington took over {{what would become the}} Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775–76, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city. The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day. On the coast, Salem became a center for privateering. Although the documentation <b>is</b> <b>incomplete,</b> about 1700 letters of marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers and are credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation <b>is</b> <b>incomplete,</b> as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of erect limbs in mammals <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> — living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared {{sometime in the}} late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it {{is found in the}} eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) has {{not been}} recorded, {{but there is a}} {{specimen}} of its deciduous precursor (DP4). This tooth is characterized by four major cusps (protocone, paracone, hypocone, and metacone) and lophs or crests (protoloph, mesoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph), separated by synclines or valleys. The first and second upper molar (M1 and M2) are almost square and similar in size and structure to the DP4. An additional loph on M1 and M2, the entoloph, <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> in Apeomyoides, but more prominent in both Megapeomys bobwilsoni and Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory <b>is</b> <b>incomplete.</b> The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E

5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term <b>is</b> <b>incomplete.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} <b>is</b> <b>incomplete,</b> and that {{he knows what he}} must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum <b>is</b> <b>incomplete</b> {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
