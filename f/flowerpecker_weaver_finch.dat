40|$|While human {{tinkering}} with the zoogeographical distribution of lower animals sometimes pays dividends, more often it opens up Pandora 2 ̆ 7 s box. Such {{is the case of}} the <b>Weaver</b> <b>Finch</b> family. This group of birds is characterized by its colonial habits, granivorous appetite which often counters man 2 ̆ 7 s best interests, and elaborate nest structures. The House Sparrow (passer domesticus) is a notable exception of the latter trait as its nests look like a Picasso interpretation of an Afro wig. <b>Weaver</b> <b>Finches</b> originated in Africa. Here they are found in their most numerous forms. The Quelea quelea in flocks of several million compete seriously with human food supplies. They are the prime avian pests on that continent. Despite this background, some <b>Weaver</b> <b>Finches</b> have been intentionally transplanted {{to other parts of the}} world including the Caribbean Islands by thoughtless humans (Bond, 1971; Wetmore and Swales, 1931). The House Sparrow is found on Grand Bahama, Cuba and Jamaica; the Hooded <b>Weaver</b> <b>Finch</b> (spermestes cucullatus) and the Orange-cheeked <b>Weaver</b> <b>Finch</b> (Estrilda melpoda) are confined to Puerto Rico; and the Village Weaver (Textor [ploceus]cucullatus) : is found only on the island of Hispaniola. This paper considers the problem of the latter species...|$|R
50|$|The {{cut-throat}} finch (Amadina fasciata) {{is a common}} species of estrildid finch found throughout Africa; it {{is also known as}} the bearded finch, the ribbon finch, the cut throat, and the <b>weaver</b> <b>finch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The red-browed <b>finch,</b> {{like other}} <b>weaver</b> <b>finches,</b> builds a large domed nest, {{with a side}} entrance, out of grass and small twigs. Nests are usually built 2-3 metres above the ground in dense shrubs. Nesting is communal. Both parents share nest building, {{incubation}} of the eggs, and feed the young together. Four to six white eggs are laid per clutch {{two or three times}} per year, between October and April. Juveniles are fully independent within 28 days.|$|R
50|$|Small {{groups of}} these animals are often found in unusual {{roosting}} sites {{such as in the}} suspended nests of <b>weaver</b> <b>finches</b> and sunbirds, banana tree leaves, or under the eaves of huts. The bright and broken coloration of these bats may be a form of camouflage to protect them while they roost in vulnerable sites. Although nothing is known of their reproductive habits, Painted bats have nuclear family units - that is, a mother, a father, and young. Hunting flights last around 1-2 hours.|$|R

50|$|Weaver birds, {{also known}} as <b>weaver</b> <b>finches,</b> get their name because of their {{elaborate}}ly woven nests (the most elaborate of any birds'), though some are notable for their selective parasitic nesting habits. The nests vary in size, shape, material used, and construction techniques from species to species. Materials used for building nests include fine leaf fibers, grass, and twigs. Many species weave very fine nests using thin strands of leaf fiber, though some, like the buffalo-weavers, form massive untidy stick nests in their colonies, which may have spherical woven nests within. The sparrow weavers of Africa build apartment-house nests, in which 100 to 300 pairs have separate flask-shaped chambers entered by tubes at the bottom. Most species weave nests that have narrow entrances, facing downward.|$|R

40|$|In this radio broadcast, Dieter Oschadleus {{discusses}} weavers, from nest-building {{patterns to}} {{the different kinds of}} weavers (masked weaver, widow and bishop birds, and sparrow <b>weavers,</b> scaly-feathered <b>finch,</b> etc.) and their respective habitats. Weaver nest sites also attract a variety of predators (snakes, birds of prey) and obligate nesters such as the pygmy falcon who do not create their own nests, and thus weaver sites create their own ecologies through provision of shade and concentration of droppings. Citizen scientists can get involved by photographs of weaver sites which are then used to build up a database of weaver sites which provide demographic information very useful to avian zoologists.

50|$|Hunts on the wing, mainly at {{dawn and}} dusk. When not {{breeding}} the African hobby is thought to feed almost entirely on flying insects: termite alates, grasshoppers, locusts, beetles and cicadas have all been recorded. Feeding concentrations of up to 30 birds have been recorded when termite alates or locusts are swarming. When breeding {{a high proportion of}} small birds such as <b>weavers,</b> estrildid <b>finches</b> and swallows up to the size of doves are favoured. It hunts either by making sorties from a perch or quartering across favoured hunting areas at 50-100m. Normally encountered as solitary birds but sometimes in pairs or small family groups. For nesting they use the old stick nests of other birds, especially black kite, which are situated high in a tree. Breeding has been recorded in December to June {{in the western part of}} the range, August to December in equatorial East Africa and September to January in southern Africa.|$|R
40|$|The small African <b>weaver</b> <b>finch</b> {{commonly}} known as Quelea (Quelea quelea) has been reported (Crook and Ward, 1968) {{to be one of}} the most numerous and destructive birds in the world and is found extensively throughout Africa (DeGrazio, 1974). Quelea have been associated with damage to many agricultural crops including millet, grain sorghum, rice, and wheat. Because current population control programs in Africa have not reduced damage except in a few local areas (Crook and Ward, 1968), more effective damage control methods need to be Inves- tigated. One promising method, protection of the agricultural crop with a chemical repellent, methiocarb, has been demonstrated to be highly effective (Guarino, 1972). Small scale efficacy demonstrations in Tanzania (DeGrazio, 1974) with three pounds of methiocarb per acre to protect maturing rice and wheat have reduced Quelea damage by about 90 percent. Methiocarb is thought to produce a post-ingestional effect in the affected birds (Guarino, 1972). Rogers (1974) has presented some evidence that methiocarb, unlike a highly bitter-tasting compound (sucrose octaacetate), affects feeding activity of Red-winged Blackbirds (Ageliaus phoenlceus), but some time delay is required for affectation and subsequent feeding aversion. The development of the repellent (or aversion) response for methiocarb was similar to the aversive response shown to lithium chloride (LiCl), a salt that has been traditionally used to study conditioned aversion in rats (Nachman, 1963). This aversion effect is then thought to become quickly associated with the taste of methiocarb or treated food material (Crase and DeHaven, 1976). Schafer, Brunton, and Lockyer (1977) observed that most of the seven bird species they tested [Robins (Turdus migratorius), Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), White-crowned Sparrows (zonotrlchia leucophrys). House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), Starlings (sturnus vulgaris), Grackles (Quiscalus qaiscula), and Red-winged Blackbirds] displayed more food aversion and longer-lasting conditioning to methiocarb when compared with thiram (TMTD), a taste repellent. Both repellent materials were placed on food particles at levels slightly lower than the R- 50 for Red-winged Blackbirds (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). To more effectively predict field application rates for protecting cereal grains from Quelea damage in Africa, we felt it necessary to compare the sensitivity of Quelea to methiocarb with sensitivities reported for other bird species (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). In addition, we wanted to determine the relative importance of taste versus visual feeding cues that could become associated with methiocarb exposure in Quelea. Knowledge gained from these studies could lead to an improved application method that would enhance the long-term repellent action of methiocarb with low level methiocarb treatments in conjunction with other stimuli. Aversive cues could also be used to alter food-searching behavior (Crase and DeHaven, 1976) so that Quelea repelled from agricultural crops would more quickly seek alternate natural foods such as grass or weed seeds and Insects...|$|R
