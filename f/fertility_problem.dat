40|$|Background: Information on {{postoperative}} <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> {{in female}} patients with {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP) is scarce. Previous studies in FAP or colitis patients almost uniformly describe a reduction in fertility after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, compared with ileorectal anastomosis. Objective: To describe <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> in female FAP patients after colectomy and to investigate the relationship between self-reported <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> {{and the type of}} operation and other surgery-related factors (eg, comorbid conditions). Methods: A questionnaire addressing surgery, <b>fertility</b> <b>problems,</b> and desire to have children was sent to a nationwide sample of FAP patients. Medical data were verified in the FAP-registry of the Netherlands Foundation for the Detection of Hereditary Tumors. Differences between women with and without <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> were investigated. Results: Of 138 patients, 23 (17 %) reported current or past <b>fertility</b> <b>problems.</b> The prevalence of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> was similar among those who had undergone ileorectal anastomosis, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, and proctocolectomy with ileostomy. None of the other surgery-related factors, nor desmoid tumors or cancer were associated significantly with the development of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems.</b> Patients reporting <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> were significantly younger at diagnosis of FAP (mean, 20 vs. 27 years, P < 0. 05) and {{at the time of the}} first surgical procedure (mean, 22 vs. 28 years, P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The risk of developing postoperative <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> is not associated significantly with the type of surgery, indication for surgery, complications, or other comorbid conditions. Postoperative <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> are more common among women who had their first surgical procedure at a younger ag...|$|R
40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that individuals with <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> report lower levels of resilience. However, with only one other empirical study examining the relationship between resilience and <b>fertility</b> <b>problems,</b> the investigators of this study were interested in whether a similar relationship would be found when a non-clinical population was surveyed. A total of 322 participants (208 with a history of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> and 114 with no history of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems)</b> completed a brief online questionnaire comprised of demographic items, a resilience measure (Brief Resilience Scale), a coping strategies measure (Brief COPE), and a measure of general distress (General Health Questionnaire). The investigators found that individuals in the history of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> group had significantly lower levels of resilience (t(320) = - 5. 863, p =. 000) and higher levels of general distress (t(314) = 5. 001, p =. 000) compared with the no history of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> group.

40|$|Because {{motherhood}} is {{an expected}} and valued {{identity in the}} United States, becoming a mother should {{lead to an increase}} in self-esteem and perceiving a problem becoming a mother should lead to a decrease in self-esteem. Little research has examined the combined experience of both identifying with a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> and becoming a mother or not over time. Guided by identity theory framework, this study uses two waves of data from the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB) to examine how change and stability in motherhood status and perceived fertility barrier status is associated with changes in self-esteem among women who initially were not mothers. Results revealed that gaining or losing a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> identity was not associated with changes in self-esteem; however, becoming a mother was associated with increased self-esteem. The persistence of a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> identity was associated with a decrease in self-esteem for those who did not become a mother and increased self-esteem for those who did become a mother. Women who did not report a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> at either interview and became a mother by wave 2 had a significant increase in self-esteem between waves. A small group of women became mothers and identified a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> at wave two; this group had a substantial increase in self-esteem, and the association was larger for older compared to younger women. These findings suggest that becoming a mother has a bigger impact on a woman’s self-esteem than perceiving a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem.</b> Adviser: Julia McQuilla...|$|E
30|$|Pastoralists in {{the study}} region {{considered}} cattle diseases {{a major threat to}} their livelihoods, and they used a variety of strategies to prevent diseases including smoky fires against flies and mosquitoes, prophylactic use of veterinary medicine, and vaccinations. The majority of our informants argued that diseases could cause <b>fertility</b> <b>problems,</b> including abortions. Diseases such as awse (trypanosomiasis), mbooru (foot-and-mouth disease), baakaale (brucellosis) and haahaande (heart-water) were mentioned as possible causes of abortions, but biting flies, snakes, and being hit with a stick were also mentioned. While baakaale (brucellosis) was frequently mentioned as a disease that can cause abortions in cattle, pastoralists were more concerned with awse (trypanosomiasis). Thus, while pastoralists recognized that a range of diseases could potentially cause <b>fertility</b> <b>problems,</b> they were not overly concerned with brucellosis as a cause of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} {{coping strategies}} and communication strategies {{as predictors of}} <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress 12 months after start of fertility treatment. METHODS: We used a prospective, longitudinal cohort design including 2250 people beginning fertility treatment with a 12 -month follow-up. Data were based on self-administered questionnaires measuring communication with partner and with other people, coping strategies: active-avoidance coping, active-confronting coping, passive-avoidance coping, meaning-based coping, and <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress. The study population included those participants (n = 816, men and women) who had not achieved pregnancy by assisted reproduction or delivery at follow-up. RESULTS: Among both men and women, difficulties in partner communication predicted high <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress (odds ratio for women, 3. 47, 95 % confidence interval 2. 09 – 5. 76; odds ratio for men, 3. 69, 95 % confidence interval 2. 09 – 6. 43). Active-avoidance coping (e. g. avoiding being with pregnant women or children, turning to work to take their mind off things) {{was a significant predictor}} of high <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress. Among men, high use of active-confronting coping (e. g. letting feelings out, asking other people for advice, seeking social support) predicted low <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress in the marital domain (odds ratio 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval 0. 28 – 1. 00). Among women, medium or high use of meaning-based coping significantly predicted low <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> stress in the personal and marital domain.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the impact of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> on couples as a unit. The meaning of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> and how couples {{reported}} they communicated were the main areas of interest. A cross-sectional semi-structured interview study was employed. Ten couples were recruited via the Hull FVF unit and interviewed by the primary researcher. The interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Two super-ordinate themes emerged: Expectations of life -"What's it all about? " highlighted the lifecycle expectations people have; how when our expectations are not met one considers one's commitments and goals in life; and the impact of fertility treatment on all of these factors. Dealing with ongoing <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> - 'When it doesn't happen how we expect" presented the differing responses to ongoing infertility with feelings of resentment and acceptance emerging. Communication was revealed to play an important, yet complex, role in the experience of continued <b>fertility</b> <b>problems.</b> Women seemed to have a greater need for communicating, both with their partner and with others. The couples that reported effective communication {{were also more likely to}} report successfully managing any differences as well as satisfaction with their relationship. The themes were discussed in relation to previous theory and research; the stress and coping model was found to be helpful for guiding the research process, but did not seem sufficient to fully explain the depth of meaning the <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> had for the couples. Further research on couple communication is recommended. The main clinical implications of the study pointed to couples needing time out from treatment to process their experiences and for counselling to be offered more regularly at different points in time.

40|$|Introduction: Developing a {{tool for}} {{measuring}} patient’s problems is a vital {{step in the process}} of infertility treatment and research. <b>Fertility</b> <b>Problem</b> Inventory (FPI) is a questionnaire, which was made by Newton in 1999 to detect <b>fertility</b> <b>problem</b> associated within fertile couples, including 46 questions and five domains. Since validity and reliability of any instrument should be evaluated in the new environment and culture, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the validity and reliability of the FPI in Iranian infertile couples. Materials and methods: Four hundred and ten patients in different stages of infertility treatment filled <b>Fertility</b> <b>Problem</b> Inventory. Forty-five patients answered the questionnaire twice at an interval of 2  weeks. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were measured by Cronbach’s alpha, interclass correlation, test retest, inter-rater agreement (IRA), exploratory factorial analyses and multi-trait scaling analysis. Results: Using a conservative approach, the IRA for the overall relevancy and clarity of the tool was 88. 34 % and 92. 14 %, respectively. Overall appropriateness and clarity were 92. 23 % and 94. 48 %, respectively. Overall integrity of the instrument was determined to be 87 %. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was greater than 70 % for all domains. The ICC ranged between 0. 78 (Relationship concern) and 0. 92 (Sexual concern). Exploratory factorial analyses demonstrate five fields suitable for instrument. The correlation of each item with its own scale (Rho ⩾  0. 4) represented a high convergent validity. In the discriminant validity of the tool, the correlation of each item with its own hypothesized domain was also greater than its correlation with other areas of the questionnaire. Conclusion: The results showed that Persian version of the FPI is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the fertility problems in infertile patients...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the psychosocial {{processes involved in}} women's experiences of living with endometriosis. Ten women diagnosed with endometriosis participated in unstructured formal interviews. The researcher discovered that the respondents define endometriosis as a chronic illness and, consequently, they are undergoing a process of learning how to live with endometriosis. Grounded theory methodology {{was used to determine}} four stages in the process of learning to live with endometriosis: discovering the cause(s) of menstrual problems, getting treatment, dealing with doctors and living with symptoms. Phases in each stage of the process of learning to live with endometriosis are described. The social construction of endometriosis is also explored through an examination of popular magazine articles and self-help books about endometriosis. Endometriosis is primarily constructed as a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem,</b> whereas the participants regard endometriosis primarily as a chronic illness, and secondarily as a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem.</b> Women's lived realities of the disease, as described by the participants, are not usually included in the popular press. [...] Discussion focuses on the disjuncture between the lived realities of endometriosis described by the participants and the social construction of endometriosis in the popular press.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, both delay of childbearing and <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> have become {{increasingly}} common among women in developed countries.

Methods - In a prospective study including 30 women with a <b>fertility</b> <b>problem,</b> we compared nutrient intakes from a food frequency questionnaire and biomarkers related to the homocysteine pathway in blood, at two assessment periods, i. e., preconceptionally and 1 year after delivery. We used a linear mixed model and adjusted for possible confounders, such as body mass index and folic acid supplement use. Results - The energy-adjusted nutrient intakes {{were not significantly different}} between the two assessment periods, except for higher retinol, alcohol and vitamin B 2 and lower carbohydrate intakes at around 1 year after delivery.

The study was performed in the context of currently divergent views as to the burden of <b>fertility</b> <b>problems.</b> The survey was carried out using questionnaires of the self-administration type. Women with <b>fertility</b> <b>problems</b> did in fact consistently report a higher prevalence of negative emotions than the controls with reference to the periods during which they had been trying to conceive.
