Unfortunately, most parts of Dhaka having competent subsoil for building construction are already exhausted. As such, new areas are being reclaimed by both government and private agencies using dredged fill from nearby river sources.

SPT N-values of <b>filling</b> <b>layer</b> and organic layer vary from 2 to 11 and 1 to 2, respectively. It is observed that settlement of the organic layer varied from about 242 mm to 637 mm in between 1. 8 to 12. 7 years, respectively, due to overburden pressure of 100 kPa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the heat, air, and moisture conditions of slab-on-ground of a heated building. Measurements show that the coarse-grained <b>fill</b> or drainage <b>layers</b> beneath heated slab-on-ground struc-tures are warm and moist throughout the year. Moisture migration: gravitational water, ground water table, capillary action and diffusion, keep these layer moist throughout the year. The water vapor content of the warm and moist <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> is usually higher than the content of the indoor air. Thus, the diffusion flow is directed into the indoor air, despite the existing heat flow into the opposite direction, and the ground is a moisture source for the structures above. Therefore, thermal and moisture conditions of the <b>fill</b> <b>layers</b> have the major effect on the overall moisture behavior of ground slabs: on the drying times of the fresh in situ cast concrete slab, and on the thermal and moisture behavior of the structure in normal long-term conditions. These conditions are also favorable for microbe growth, which is very common in <b>fill</b> <b>layers.</b> Fungal or bacterial growth was detected in 98 % of the test specimens taken beneath the ground slabs of heated buildings.

A polymer/solvent [poly(ether-sulfone) / 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone] system filled with alumina powder is extruded into a nonsolvent bath to form the fibers which are then dried and sintered at high temp. to give alumina fibers. The fibers were characterized using a combined dry and wet gas permeation method and using SEM. Fibers were coated using simple dip coating techniques to study the effects on minimizing defects and max. pore size. More complex techniques have not been used, {{as there is no}} need to reduce median pore size given the intended application. Finally fibers were constructed into a module for parallel flow phase contacting. Mass transfer studies were carried out on removal of dissolved O from H 2 O, Ar was used as a stripping gas. Varied liq. flow, tube side pressure and gas flow were studied. The results were compared with predictions based on known mass transfer correlations for hollow fiber contactors. Mass transfer was strongly limited by diffusion through the liq. filled membrane. By increasing tube side pressure the liq. /gas interface could be driven back across the fiber wall resulting in effectively 2 mass transfer <b>layers,</b> one liq. <b>filled</b> <b>layer,</b> and one gas <b>filled</b> <b>layer.</b> Mass transfer is far faster in the gas <b>filled</b> <b>layer</b> so overall mass transfer is improved as the liq. <b>filled</b> <b>layer</b> is reduced.

40|$|AbstractThe {{shortage}} of available and suitable construction sites in city centres {{has led to}} the increased use of problematic areas, where the bearing capacity of the underlying deposits is very low. The reinforcement of these problematic soils with granular <b>fill</b> <b>layers</b> is one of the soil improvement techniques that are widely used. Problematic soil behaviour can be improved by totally or partially replacing the inadequate soils with layers of compacted granular fill. The study presented herein describes the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the multi-linear regression model (MLR) to predict the bearing capacity of circular shallow footings supported by layers of compacted granular fill over natural clay soil. The data used in running the network models have been obtained from an extensive series of field tests, including large-scale footing diameters. The field tests were performed using seven different footing diameters, up to 0. 90 m, and three different granular <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses. The results indicate that the use of granular <b>fill</b> <b>layers</b> over natural clay soil has a considerable effect on the bearing capacity characteristics and that the ANN model serves as a simple and reliable tool for predicting the bearing capacity of circular footings in stabilized natural clay soil...|$|R

In practice, however, the required strength and stiffness is frequently divided into two ore more GR layers {{with or without a}} layer of granular material in between. This paper compares three geogrid-systems : (1) one GR layer consisting of one biaxial geogrid and a (2) one GR layer consisting of two uniaxial geogrids installed directly upon each other and (3) two geogrids with a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> in between. Five model tests have been carried out to study the differences between these three systems. This test series has been presented earlier by Van Eekelen et al. 2012 a. The present paper presents part of the results. It was shown that the behaviour of the first two systems is the same: the GR stiffness of the biaxial geogrid is apparently the same as the summed stiffness in each direction of the two uniaxial grids. It was also shown that the application of a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> between the two GR layers results in a slightly more linear dependency of the net load on the fill aan in the end of the tests, in slightly more arching. However, the differences are very small. The GR stiffness, for example, has much more influence than whether or not a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> has been applied between the two GR layers. It is therefore concluded that the stiffness and strength of two or more GR layers can be summed, thus 1 + 1 = 2 indeed...|$|R

So far, nanoholes with depth of 10 – 15 nm {{have been used as}} template for fabrication of QDs with narrow PL linewidth. This work demonstrates the generation of uniform QDs with narrow exciton peak linewidth below 100 μeV also in up to 40 nm depth holes. The deeper holes allows filling with more complex heterostructures like coupled quantum systems. As a first application of the deep droplet-etched nanoholes, self-aligned vertically stacked quantum dot pairs are successfully fabricated by hole filling. The quantum dot pairs establish exciton peaks with small linewidths of 70 – 90 μeV which is close to that from separated QDs. The narrow linewidths allow studies of molecule resonances in these systems. As an important advantage of the present method, the size of the individual QDs as well as the tunnel barrier thickness can be adjusted individually by the respective <b>filling</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Simple unpaved roads {{consist of}} a layer of coarse {{granular}} material placed directly {{onto the surface of}} weak or compressible ground. It is thought that the construction of such roads can be considerably improved by the incorporation of a geogrid {{at the base of the}} granular <b>fill</b> <b>layer.</b> Geogrids are a type of geotextile, distinguished by their relatively large aperture size. Laying out a geogrid on the surface of the ground before placing the <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> may in many cases allow a reduced thickness of fill material to be used, and may also substantially increase the load required to cause a complete failure of the system. No generally accepted design method exists for the construction of reinforced unpaved roads, due to the complex mechanisms which govern deformations in the system. The primary aim of this dissertation was to investigate the performance, in such a construction, of a particular geogrid, namely Tensar, manufactured by Netlon Ltd. A detailed model study into failure mechanisms was undertaken using laboratory apparatus constructed to conduct work at 1 / 4 full scale. Simple plane-strain, monotonic footing tests were carried out on systems consisting of a <b>fill</b> <b>layer</b> compacted onto a consolidated clay subgrade, both with and without the incorporation of a model grid at their interface. The testing technique included a comprehensive study of photographs taken of marker movements in the clay through the transparent sides of the test-box during tests. The relevant failure mechanisms associated with reinforced and unreinforced systems were established. In addition the significance of shear stresses acting at the subgrade surface was recognised and a concept whereby the appropriate subgrade bearing capacity factor is related to these shear stresses was developed. The modelling techniques adopted in this work obviated the need for a centrifuge...|$|R

By building a computational model based on the temperature data of overhead track slab in Chongqing, Wang et al. [12] obtained the maximum warpage of the track slab (0.82  mm).
