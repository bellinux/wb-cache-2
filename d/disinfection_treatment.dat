Three different treatments were assayed: sterilization (121 &# 186;C), immersion in hot water (60 and 80 &# 186;C), and immersion in alkalinized water. Wheat straw, wheat seeds and Eucalyptus or Populus sawdust were used separately as substrates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to <b>disinfection</b> <b>treatment</b> with photolysis of H 2 O 2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the <b>disinfection</b> <b>treatment</b> up to 40 times.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients seem {{to adhere}} better to {{short-term}} periodontal treatment schemes. Besides, time-reduced treatments are more cost-effective. However, {{the degree of}} benefits related {{to this type of}} treatment still requires additional investigations. AIM: The present short-term study evaluated clinical and microbiological outcomes, from baseline to 3 -months, of chronic periodontitis subjects treated by the one-stage full-mouth disinfection protocol. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixteen chronic periodontitis subjects (mean-age 49. 87 ± 8. 22) who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were included. A calibrated examiner measured whole-mouth plaque and gingival indices, periodontal pocket depth and clinical attachment level at baseline and at 3 -months. Subgingival samples were also collected from the 5 most diseased periodontal sites to determine total bacterial load and levels of P. gingivalis and S. oralis by real time qPCR. Periodontal treatment consisted of full-mouth manual debridement plus wide intraoral use of chlorhexidine in gel and solution. Additionally, after debridement, individuals rinsed 0. 12 % chlorhexidine at home twice a day for the following 2 months. Data monitored were compared by paired Student-t test (p< 0. 05). RESULT: Statistical analysis revealed that, in general, one-stage full-mouth <b>disinfection</b> <b>treatment</b> provided significant clinical and microbiological improvements at 3 -months.

Modulation of growth, biofilm formation, and biofilm composition was achieved by addition of manganese sulfate and/or glucose to the BHI medium. Composition analyses of the mixed species biofilms using plate counts and fluorescence microscopy with dual fluorophores showed that mixed species biofilms were formed in BHI (total count, 8 - 9 log 10 cfu/well) and that they contained 1 - 2 log 10 cfu/well more L. monocytogenes than L. plantarum cells. Addition of manganese sulfate resulted in equal numbers of both species (total count, 8 log 10 cfu/well) in the mixed species biofilm, while manganese sulfate in combination with glucose, resulted in 1 - 2 log 10 more L. plantarum than L. monocytogenes cells (total count, 9 log 10 cfu/well). Corresponding single species biofilms of L. monocytogenes and L. plantarum contained up to 9 log 10 cfu/well.

In 2008 there was a large food-borne outbreak of Salmonella Agona linked to a food processing facility. Prior to this outbreak, S. Agona was less frequently implicated in food-borne infections.

Crop developments (yield, disease and root development) and composition of the microflora were recorded. Non-inoculated plants showed that disinfection is needed either with UV or slow (sand) filtration to avoid spread of the pathogen; yield and root development was better and disease symptoms were less compared to the control. The hypothesis that passive disinfection might realise a more suppressive environment against Pythium aphanidermatum could not be proved, since inoculated plants showed a similar yield, disease and root development after the different <b>disinfection</b> <b>treatments.</b> Priming the nutrient solution with an 'old' solution did not show significant differences in the composition of the microflora either by plate-counts or by PCR-DGGE.
