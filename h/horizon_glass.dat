Light from the celestial body strikes the index mirror and is reflected to the silvered portion of the <b>horizon</b> <b>glass,</b> then back to the observer's eye through the telescope. The observer manipulates the index arm so the reflected image of the body in the <b>horizon</b> <b>glass</b> is just resting on the visual horizon, seen through the clear side of the <b>horizon</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Francis Ronalds invented an {{instrument}} for recording angles in 1829 by modifying the octant. A disadvantage of reflecting instruments in surveying applications is that optics dictate that the mirror and index arm rotate through half the angular separation of the two objects. The angle thus needs to be read, noted and a protractor employed to draw the angle on a plan. Ronalds’ idea was to configure the index arm to rotate through twice {{the angle of the}} mirror, so that the arm could then be used to draw a line at the correct angle directly onto the drawing. He used a sector as the basis of his instrument and placed the <b>horizon</b> <b>glass</b> at one tip and the index mirror near the hinge connecting the two rulers. The two revolving elements were linked mechanically and the barrel supporting the mirror was twice the diameter of the hinge to give the required angular ratio.|$|E

5000|$|In his Astronomical Memoirs Tebbutt gave {{an account}} of his discovery: ... On the evening of May 13, 1861, while searching the western sky for comets, I {{detected}} a faint nebulous object near the star Lacaille 1316 in the constellation Eridanus. In my marine telescope the object appeared much diffused, and {{it was with the}} greatest difficulty that I estimated its distance from three well known fixed stars. The object was hardly distinguishable in the small telescope attached to the sextant, and I found it necessary to employ a coloured glass between the index and <b>horizon</b> <b>glasses,</b> for the superior brilliance of the reference stars Procyon, Sirius and Canopus, when they were brought into the field of view, quite extinguished its feeble light. The measurements gaveR.A. = 3 h. 54 m. 12 s.Declin. = —30° 44&#8242;as the place of the object at 6 h. 57 m. local mean time. Every comet hunter knows how necessary it is to the carrying out of his work to have at hand a copious catalogue of nebulae, but this valuable adjunct I unfortunately did not possess. I could not, however, find the object in the limited catalogues at my command. I accordingly made up my mind to watch it, and it is well that I did so, otherwise I should have missed one of the best opportunities for introducing myself to the astronomical world. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{videogame}} Orb-3D for the Nintendo Entertainment System {{used the}} effect (by having the player's ship always moving) and came packed {{with a pair}} of glasses. So did Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D for the Super NES, using constantly scrolling backgrounds to cause the effect. Also {{on the first day of}} Super Mario 64's release, Toys R US offered glasses to view Super Mario 64 through. There were only 2 2D compatible technologies which use clear lenses, Chromodepth and Pulfrich. Since Chromodepth would make Mario, a Red-and-Blue clad character look funny, and most walking scenes were filmed with Mario in the foreground slightly left of center, the left having the perpendicular to the long horizon, and the right line of sight extending into the <b>horizon,</b> Pulfrich <b>glasses</b> were assumed to be the type included in the Toys R Us pack.|$|R
6000|$|Just at that instant, {{some one}} cried out [...] "Sail-ho!" [...] and sure enough, a ship was seen some {{four or five}} miles to leeward, a whaler evidently, turning to windward, under easy canvass, in order to rejoin her boat, from which she had lately been {{separated}} by the night and the fog. This, then, {{was no more than}} a whaler and her boat; and, on sweeping the <b>horizon</b> with a <b>glass,</b> Talcott soon discovered, a mile to windward of the boat, a dead whale, with another boat lying by it, in waiting for the approach of the ship, which promised to fetch as far to windward, on its next tack.|$|R

6000|$|We had {{a curious}} {{experience}} today. A little after I had sealed and directed my letter to you, in which I {{said we should}} make Avignon before 4, we got lost. We ceased to encounter any village or ruin mentioned in our [...] "particularizes" [...] and detailed Guide of the Rhone--went drifting along by the hour in a wholly unknown land and on an uncharted river! Confound it, we stopped talking and did nothing but stand up in the boat and search the <b>horizons</b> with the <b>glass</b> and wonder what in the devil had happened. And at last, away yonder at 5 o'clock when some east towers and fortresses hove in sight we couldn't recognize them for Avignon--yet we knew by the broken bridge that it was Avignon.|$|R
60|$|As Daly was the {{recognised}} jester of the fleet, {{his extraordinary}} attempt {{to announce his}} vessel's name was received as a characteristic joke, and it served to laugh at until something better offered. Under the actual circumstances of the two squadrons, however, it was soon temporarily forgotten in graver things, for few believed the collision that had already taken place was to satisfy {{a man of the}} known temperament of the commander-in-chief. As the junction of the rear division was the only thing wanting to bring on a general engagement, as soon as the weather should moderate a little, every ship had careful look-outs aloft, sweeping the <b>horizon</b> constantly with <b>glasses,</b> more particularly towards the east and north-east. The gale broke about noon, though the wind still continued fresh from the same quarter as before. The sea began to go down, however, and at eight bells material changes had occurred in the situations of both fleets. Some of these {{it may be necessary to}} mention.|$|R
60|$|The wind is veering {{round in}} an easterly direction, {{but is still}} very slight. I think the ice is lying closer than it did yesterday. As {{far as the eye}} can reach on every side there is one wide expanse of spotless white, only broken by an {{occasional}} rift or the dark shadow of a hummock. To the south there is the narrow lane of blue water which is our sole means of escape, and which is closing up every day. The Captain is taking a heavy responsibility upon himself. I hear that the tank of potatoes has been finished, and even the biscuits are running short, but he preserves the same impassable countenance, and spends the greater part of the day at the crow's nest, sweeping the <b>horizon</b> with his <b>glass.</b> His manner is very variable, and he seems to avoid my society, but there has been no repetition of the violence which he showed the other night.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{criteria for}} andosol classification in the World Reference Base (WRB) of Soil Resources were evaluated using the Tohoku University World Andosol Database (TUWAD). The WRB proposal defines a diagnostic andic horizon comprised of vitr-andic, alu-andic, and sil-andic subtypes, and eight second level soil units. Several notable refinements to the WRB criteria were apparent from evaluation of soil properties from TUWAD and are proposed as revised criteria. Our {{analysis indicated that}} the most effective criteria for differentiating the andic <b>horizon</b> were <b>glass</b> content, phosphate retention, oxalate extractable Al and Fe, pyrophosphate-extractable Al, and bulk density. The vitr-andic horizon is distinguished by its low degree of weathering, evident from its low oxalate extractable Al and Fe, low P retention, and high glass content. The ratio of pyrophosphate to oxalate extractable Al is used to separate andic horizons dominated by Al-humus, complexes (alu-andic, Al(p) /Al(o) greater or equal than 0. 5), from those dominated by allophanic materials (sil-andic, Al(p) /Al(o) < 0. 5). When Al(p) data are not availabe, the Si(o) value of 0. 6 {{could be used as}} an approximate criteria. We also propose revisions to the nine second level soil units based on the dominant pedogenic processes occurring in andosols : non-crystalline material formation and organic matter accumulation. These soil units are based on the degree of weathering (oxalate extractable Al, Fe, glass content), the dominant weathering agent (organic acids vs. carbonic acid), type (melanic or fulvic) and quantity of organic matter, and high 1. 5 MPa water-holding capacity. The revised criteria determined by this study effectively differentiate andosols based on their dominant pedogenic processes, and the relationship or soil properties to productivity and utilization.

6000|$|It {{had blown}} {{hard in the}} night, but the wind had dropped with the dawning, and now the rising sun tinted {{the fringe of the}} storm-wrack as it dwindled into the west and glinted on the endless crests of the long, green waves. [...] To north and south and west lay a skyline which was {{unbroken}} save by the spout of foam when two of the great Atlantic seas dashed each other into spray. To the east was a rocky island, jutting out into craggy points, with a few scattered clumps of palm trees and a pennant of mist streaming out from the bare, conical hill which capped it. A heavy surf beat upon the shore, and, at a safe distance from it, the British 32-gun frigate Leda, Captain A. P. Johnson, raised her black, glistening side upon the crest of a wave, or swooped down into an emerald valley, dipping away to the nor'ard under easy sail. On her snow-white quarter-deck stood a stiff little brown-faced man, who swept the <b>horizon</b> with his <b>glass.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{analyzed}} 56 {{samples from}} Site U 1426, 56 samples from Site U 1427, and 28 samples from Site U 1429. Occurrences of tephra layers were recorded during shipboard visual core descriptions. Recognition of tephra layers {{was based on}} color, sedimentary structures, and components. The samples were ultrasonicated to remove clay contaminants and then separated into four grain-size fractions using 32, 63, and 250  μm sieves. The major-element composition of volcanic glass shards was analyzed using scanning electron microscope–energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS, Jeol JSM- 6510 LV+Oxford INCA x-Act EDS system) at Fukushima University, Japan. Synthetic and natural mineral standards were used primarily for quantitative calibrations. Compositions of eight major elements were further recalibrated by sub-standards, the compositions of which were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis (Nagahashi et al. 2003). In addition, the mineralogical composition, the morphology and relative compositions of volcanic glass shards, and the heavy mineral composition (specific gravity 2.8) were investigated for grains in the 63 – 250  μm size fraction of samples collected from key correlative <b>horizons.</b> Images of <b>glass</b> morphology were obtained using a low-vacuum SEM (Hitachi Miniscope TM- 1000).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} all that, Mr. Mulford, but it came too late. When I first went aloft, I {{came out on the}} north-west side of the lantern, and took my seat, to look out for the sloop-of-war, as you bade me, sir. Well, there I was sweepin' the <b>horizon</b> with the <b>glass</b> {{for the better part of}} an hour, {{sometimes}} fancyin' I saw her, and then givin' it up; for to this moment I am not sartain there is n't a sail off here to the westward, turning up toward the light on a bowline; but if there be, she's too far off to know anything partic'lar about her. Well, sir, there I sat, looking for the Poughkeepsie, for the better part of an hour, when I thought I would go round on t' other side of the lantern and take a look to windward. My heart was in my mouth, I can tell you, Miss Rose, when I saw the brig; and I felt both glad and sorry. Glad on my own account, and sorry on your'n. There she was, however, and no help for it, within two miles of this very spot, and coming down as if she despised touching the water at all. Now, what could I do? There was n't time, Mr. Mulford, to get the boat out, and the mast stepped, afore we should have been within reach of canister, and Stephen Spike would not have spared that, in order to get you again within his power." ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{had taken}} a good look at his old possessions, Mark made a sweep of the <b>horizon</b> with the <b>glass,</b> in order to {{ascertain}} if any other land were visible, from the great elevation on which he now stood. While arranging the focus of the instrument, an object first met his eye that caused his heart almost to leap into his mouth. Land was looming up, in the western board, so distinctly as to admit of no cavil about its presence. It was an island, mountainous, and Mark supposed it must be fully a hundred miles distant. Still it was land, and strange land, and might prove to be the abode of human beings. The glass told him very little more than his eye, though he could discern a mountainous form through it, {{and saw that it was}} an island of no great size. Beyond this mountain, again, the young man fancied that he could detect the haze of more land; but, if he did, it was too low, too distant, and too indistinct, to be certain of it. It is not easy to give a clear idea of the tumult of feeling with which Mark Woolston beheld these unknown regions, though it might best be compared with the emotions of the astronomer who discovers a new planet. It would scarce exceed the truth to say that he regarded that dim, blue mountain, which arose in the midst of a watery waste, with as much of admiration, mysterious awe and gratification united, as Herschel may have been supposed to feel when he established the character of Uranus. It was fully an hour before our hermit could turn his eyes in any other direction.|$|R
60|$|The vessels {{were now}} {{within a mile}} of each other. The breeze was steady, and {{sufficiently}} fresh for all the ordinary evolutions of a naval combat; while the water was just quiet enough to permit the ships to be handled with confidence and accuracy. La Fontange was running with her head to the eastward, and, as she had the advantage of the wind, her tall tracery of spars leaned gently in the direction of her adversary. The Coquette was standing on the other tack, and necessarily inclined from her enemy. Both vessels were stripped to their top-sails, spankers, and jibs, though the lofty sails of the Frenchman were fluttering in the breeze, like the graceful folds of some fanciful drapery. No human being was distinctly visible in either fabric, though dark clusters around each mast-head showed that the ready top-men were prepared to discharge their duties, even in the confusion and dangers of the impending contest. Once or twice, la Fontange inclined her head more in the direction of her adversary; and then, sweeping up again to the wind, she stood on in stately beauty The moment was near when the ships were about to cross each other, at a point where a musket would readily send its messenger across the waiter that lay between them. Ludlow, who closely watched each change of position, and every {{rise and fall of the}} breeze, went on the poop, and swept the <b>horizon</b> with his <b>glass,</b> for the last time before his ship should be enveloped in smoke. To his surprise, he discovered a pyramid of canvas rising above the sea, in the direction of the wind. The sail was clearly visible to the naked eye, and had only escaped earlier observation in the duties of so urgent a moment. Calling the master to his side, he inquired his opinion concerning the character of the second stranger. But Trysail confessed it exceeded even his long-tried powers of observation to say more than that it was a ship running before the wind, with a cloud of sail spread. After a second and a longer look, however, the experienced master ventured to add that the stranger had the squareness and symmetry of a cruiser, but of what size he would not yet presume to declare.|$|R
