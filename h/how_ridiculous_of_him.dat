"Ah! {{of course}} you are right, Heigham, quite right," [...] ejaculated his host, faintly, wiping the cold sweat from his brow; [...] "it is nothing but the moonlight. <b>How</b> <b>ridiculous</b> <b>of</b> me! I suppose I am a little out of sorts--liver wrong. Give me some whisky, there's a good fellow, and I'll drink damnation to all the shadows and the trees that throw them. Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{was convicted}} or acquitted, I forget which, but I know it had {{something}} to do with Uncle Colin's journey to Russia; so <b>ridiculous</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at his age, when he ought to know better, and so unlucky for all the family, his engagement to that swindler's sister. By-the-bye, did he not cheat you out of ever so much money?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The PARTEI often caricatures the slogans {{of other}} {{political}} parties to emphasize <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> some <b>of</b> them are. For example, [...] "Hamburg - {{city in the}} North!", [...] "overcome contents" [...] (Inhalte überwinden), [...] "Education starts with 'E'" [...] (Bildung fängt mit 'B' an) or [...] "Youth crime - not with us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harry Freeling {{looked at}} his friend {{for the first time}} a little suspiciously. Could Warminster be right after all, and could Arthur really be going mad? It was so <b>ridiculous</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> to get into such a state of flurry about the ailments of a tame monkey, and at such a moment, too! [...] "Well," [...] he {{answered}} slowly, [...] "the monkey has got facial distortions due to a slight local paralysis of the inhibitory nerves supplied to the buccal and pharyngeal muscles, with a tendency to end in tetanus. If I cut a small ganglion behind the ear, and exhibit santonin, the muscles will be relaxed; and though they won't act so freely as before, they won't jerk and grimace any longer." ...|$|R
50|$|In a comical manner, {{the movie}} {{tells the story}} <b>how</b> the <b>ridiculous</b> prejudices <b>of</b> {{the people in the}} {{countryside}} can bring troubles just like that when two different lifestyles are faced to each other. The film perfectly shows the way of life of the typical Bulgarian family in the villages or the small towns from that time.|$|R
60|$|He {{moved slowly}} down the trail, still holding Ford's arm confidentially, although, owing to his large {{protecting}} manner, he seemed to offer a <b>ridiculous</b> suggestion <b>of</b> supporting <b>HIM</b> with his wounded member.|$|R
5000|$|... “Wouldn't it {{be great}} to see Mary Harneywith no clothes, running around getting a whip and being put on a bus!” [...] Ryan {{attempts}} to explain to an irate caller, who is upset at the withdrawal of cervical vaccinations for schoolchildren, <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the proposition <b>of</b> government ministers giving up their state cars would be. He was adamant that such expenses were not {{to blame for the}} current recession that grips the Irish nation.|$|R
50|$|The Esprit Party is {{introduced}} at Lady Smatter’s apartment. Burney uses this scene to really showcase <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> a few <b>of</b> {{the characters are}} in pretending to understand literature and having conversations that mean nothing. The gathering becomes a background once it is interrupted, which also proves that the gathering is really of no importance. The gathering is interrupted and focuses on censor’s concern for Beaufort and Beaufort declaring his loyalty to Cecilia and willingness to give up Lady Smatter’s inheritance.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} believe that I am a sane person again," [...] she laughed. [...] "After you had gone, {{and all those}} foolish {{children}} had departed, I felt it was quite impossible {{to sit down and}} dine alone. I wanted so much to come and I realised <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was <b>of</b> me not to have accepted at once. At the last moment I couldn't bear it any longer, so I rushed into the first gown I could find, ordered out my little coupé and here I am." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Theodora {{and her father}} had been brought into contact with visitors from the external world. One morning James brought in a card and message of inquiry from Lord St. Erme, and Lord Martindale desired that he should be admitted. Theodora had just time to think <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was <b>of</b> her to consider how she should appear to another old lover, before he came in, colouring deeply, and bending his head low, not prepared to shake hands; but when hers was held out, taking it with an eager yet bashful promptitude.|$|R
60|$|SERGIUS. And <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous!</b> Oh, war! war! {{the dream}} of patriots and heroes! A fraud, Bluntschli, a hollow sham, like love.|$|R

60|$|Ughtred {{looked down}} with grave, steadfast eyes into the girl's upturned face. It {{was time for}} him to tell her. <b>How</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it would sound. She would {{probably}} laugh at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} {{what you}} said, Stephen. But {{you were so}} strong, so calm, so sure of yourself. I think that made me angry when I thought <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> I must have been." ...|$|R
5000|$|This satirical {{comic strip}} {{collection}} examines how racism, sexism, homophobia, religion, politics, misogyny and misanthropy perpetuate the modern social landscape, and <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> {{human beings can}} be. Writer / Artist: M EmeryPublished: 2010 ...|$|R

5000|$|... "To me, {{that shot}} symbolizes the whole Yugoslav {{conflict}} of how emotional and <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the war was. You can really feel the boy's {{pain and the}} family's pain that's holding him." [...] Christopher Morris ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not crying, child. Just some foolishness of your father's. He understood--he thought--" [...] Mrs. Kenton {{began to}} laugh hysterically. [...] "But you know <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> he is; and he supposed--No, I won't tell you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best person to inform you of that would be his Highness himself," [...] said Vivian, using his friend's title {{purposely}} to show Mr. Beckendorff <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> he considered his present use of the incognito.|$|R
6000|$|... "No use {{lying to}} myself!" [...] she soliloquized. [...] "I think <b>of</b> <b>him!..</b> I can't help it... I ran out here, wild, restless, unable to reason... just because I'd {{decided to see}} him again--to make sure I--I really didn't care.... <b>How</b> furious--how <b>ridiculous</b> I'll feel--when--when--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{you became}} emperor, Zhou {{was in control}} of the {{imperial}} seal, and commanded the powerful northern guards. <b>How</b> <b>ridiculous</b> is it that he did not commit treason then, but now plans to use his small march as the base for a rebellion? ...|$|R
5000|$|Only Kristina and Natalie {{were willing}} to give out kisses, causing Sir Alan to point out <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was for Stealth to choose to run a {{business}} that five of the seven team members were not willing to take part in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! my dears, {{you will}} be glad to hear that I have {{abandoned}} my idea of wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I was and <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> I made myself! You shall never see it again!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It shan't {{come into}} court," [...] she proclaimed confidently. [...] "I shall talk to Dane. I have some {{influence}} {{with the police}} authorities here. I shall point out <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it all is. What's the use of formulating a charge that they can never, never prove?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title track}} was {{featured}} in [...] "The Great Crane Robbery", a 2000 episode of Frasier. When Frasier's new boss copies his apartment {{down to the last}} detail, Frasier tries redecorating, and the song plays over a montage <b>of</b> <b>him</b> trying a long series <b>of</b> <b>ridiculous</b> styles <b>of</b> décor.|$|R
40|$|In 1978 {{the music}} critic Lester Bangs {{published}} a typically pugnacious essay with the fighting title, 'The Ten Most <b>Ridiculous</b> Albums <b>of</b> the Seventies'. Before deliciously launching into his execution of Uri Geller's self-titled album or Rick Dees' The Original Disco Duck, Bangs asserts {{that because that}} decade was history's silliest, {{it stands to reason}} 'that ridiculous records should become the norm instead of anomalies', that abominations should be the best of our time. This absurd pretzel logic sounds uncannily like Jacques Derrida's definition of the 'post condition, since for it to arrive it begins by not arriving. Lester is thinking like a poststructuralist. The oddness of the most singularly odd album out in Bangs' greatest misses of the seventies {{had nothing to do with}} <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> it was, but the fact that it even existed at all...|$|R
6000|$|Donna Maria (rapidly, {{ignoring}} Mr. Hamlin's illustration): [...] "Well, perhaps I {{have reason}} to say so. Poor Donna Dolores was my friend.

5|$|Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov (Александр Григорьевич Заметов)– Head {{clerk at}} the police station and friend to Razumikhin. Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov's suspicions by {{explaining}} how he, Raskolnikov, would have committed various crimes, although Zamyotov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it was all a farce to expose <b>how</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the suspicions were.|$|R
6000|$|JAYSON--[Testily--going to MRS. D., who {{is still}} on her knees praying.] Do get up, Aunt Elizabeth! <b>How</b> <b>ridiculous!</b> What a scene if anyone should see you like that.

60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. Why, don't you see? <b>How</b> {{perfectly}} <b>ridiculous</b> it was <b>of</b> me not {{to think}} of it before! though I did think of it once, and hadn't the courage to insist upon it.
