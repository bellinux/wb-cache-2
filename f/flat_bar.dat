25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E
2500|$|The W was a {{standard}} gauge road with rails of [...] <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> constructed upon ties cut from white oak and locust. The main line ran [...] with another [...] of sidings and turnouts. The railroad terminated {{at the corner}} of Water and Market Streets in Winchester. The Winchester depot immediately became a key economic hub serving merchant traders in Winchester for commodities such as wheat, hide, fur, tobacco and hemp. [...] The north end of the rail line also served the thriving industrial town of Virginius Island, which sat astride the Shenandoah Canal {{on the south side of}} Harpers Ferry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} Model 520A {{was closely}} related to the Model 520, utilizing the same takedown action and locking breech block. [...] The receiver lost the distinctive double hump and had a flat top and squared-off back end. The safety was moved to the receiver tang and the trigger housing was redesigned to use a coil mainspring instead of a <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> mainspring. [...] The 520A continued to be sold as a store branded gun and under Stevens' budget line Riverside Arms (stamped Model 520). [...] The 520A was never shown in a Stevens sales publication, it only appeared in Sears & Roebuck and Montgomery Wards catalogs and in Stevens component parts catalogs (the only source where it was identified as a 520A).|$|E

2500|$|Most pocket knives {{for light}} duty are slipjoints. This {{means that the}} blade does not lock but, once opened, is {{held in place by}} tension from a <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> or leaf-type backspring that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of {{pressure}} is applied. [...] The first spring-back knives were developed around 1660 in England, but were not widely available until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution and the development of machinery capable of mass production. [...] Most locking knives have only one blade that is as large as can be fitted into the handle, because the locking mechanism relies on the spring along the back of the blade to lock it {{and it is difficult to}} build in multiple levers, one for each blade. Slipjoints tend to be smaller than other typical pocket knives.|$|E

60|$|The mariner's compass is a small, <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> of {{magnetised}} steel, which, when {{balanced on}} a pivot, turns {{one of its}} ends persistently towards the north pole--the other, of course, towards the south pole; and it does this in consequence of its being magnetised. A card is fixed above, sometimes below, this bar of steel (which is called the needle), whereon are marked the cardinal points--north, south, east, and west--with their subdivisions or intermediate points, by means of which the true direction of any point can be ascertained.|$|E

50|$|Relative to more upright hybrids, <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> road {{bikes are}} often lighter and more {{efficient}} to pedal, though less so than a drop bar bike by equal measure. Drop bar bikes will have considerable aerodynamic advantages above about 15 MPH. Conventional hybrids will have a measure of off-road capability lacking in entirety from <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> bikes. For efficient speed with the familiarity and stability of a <b>flat</b> <b>bar,</b> however, the <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> road bike is an optimal compromise.|$|E

50|$|A common {{signaling}} {{device is}} a chime unit {{consisting of two}} <b>flat</b> metal <b>bar</b> resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound ("ding-dong"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes {{only one of the}} bars, to create a single-tone ("ding") sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{other common}} lever/grip size {{is used for}} {{mountain}} and city handlebars, including <b>flat</b> <b>bars,</b> riser bars, some porteur bars, etc. On these bars the lever and grip areas have a 22.2 mm diameter. Hence, thumb shift levers, grip type shifters, MTB brake levers and Rapidfire type shifters will only fit on this smaller diameter - none could fit on a road or cyclocross bar.|$|R

5000|$|Bladesmithing began declining {{after the}} Industrial Revolution.

50|$|The {{slitting}} mill {{consisted of}} two pairs of rollers turned by water wheels.

This was then passed between flat rollers which made it into a thick plate. it was then passed through the second rollers (known as cutters), which slit it into rods. The cutters had intersecting grooves which sheared the iron lengthways.|$|R
