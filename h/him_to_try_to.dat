5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get the three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything that has happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing <b>him.</b> <b>To</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes {{through the use of}} symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing {{that he is a}} normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E

He was arrested but was pardoned in June. He was granted leave to visit his family in September, but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8, 757, he returned to Chang'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces.

500|$|Several {{cultural}} {{references are}} made during Homer's flashback to his previous visit to New York City.

[...] In the beginning of the scene, Homer passes by three pornographic film theaters, which are playing The Godfather's Parts, II, Jeremiah's Johnson, and Five Sleazy Pieces, plays on the names of The Godfather Part II, Jeremiah Johnson, and Five Easy Pieces, respectively. Woody Allen can be seen during the flashback, pouring trash out of his window onto Homer.|$|E
500|$|... "The Coup" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Paul Lieberstein, who plays series regular Toby Flenderson, and was directed by executive producer and series creator Greg Daniels. Several cast members believed the episode contains Shakespearean themes, in particular elements of the Macbeth character Lady Macbeth in Angela's storyline. Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who [...] "exerted an evil influence over her husband," [...] characteristics that fit with Angela attempting to push her lover, Dwight, into power. In her weekly blog for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery previewed the episode, [...] "Behind every great man is a pushy woman. Or in this case, a pushy, short, judgmental blonde named Angela.

Deeply shocked, Griswold traveled by train alongside her coffin, refusing to leave her side for 30hours. When fellow passengers urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sleep, he answered by kissing her dead lips and embracing her, his two children crying next to him. He refused to leave the cemetery after her funeral, even after the other mourners had left, until forced to do so by a relative. He wrote a long poem in blank verse dedicated to Caroline, [...] "Five Days", which was printed in the New York Tribune on November 16, 1842. Griswold had difficulty believing she had died and often dreamed of their reunion.

Although Chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child, his father influenced him towards computers, entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old. He found himself interested in video games that he saw there, but was not as enthusiastic about programming. While a teenager, he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played, including The Legend of Sword and Fairy, which he ascribes {{to the fact that}} he was not as exposed to books, films, or life events that other people would have had those experiences with. These experiences drove <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> create those types of feelings in games as an adult, when more emotional maturity had caused his [...] "standards to rise" [...] in what would move him in a game. It was during high school that he chose the English name Jenova after a character in Final Fantasy VII, wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were [...] "thousands of Jason Chens".|$|E

At the same time, there was also the question of finding another military-appointed prime minister to replace Hương. Taylor wanted Nguyen Luu Vien, Huong's deputy, to take over, and advised South Vietnamese officers who were on good terms with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> engineer this, but they were not able to get enough support. Eventually, Phan Huy Quát was appointed prime minister on February 14. Quát was a moderate Buddhist not associated with the political demonstrators, and seen as a compromise candidate who would be acceptable across the religious spectrum, albeit grudgingly. He was also regarded as being favorable to Khánh, who would not be around {{for more than a few}} more days to support, control or pressure him in any case. All the while, intelligence reports of Khánh's attempted dealings with the communists increased.|$|E
