5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks and Romans <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the {{magnitudes}} of {{the relative}} frequencies of the games of chance. For centuries, chance was discussed in Europe with no mathematical foundation {{and it was only}} in the 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to discuss the outcomes of games of chance as ratios. In his 1565 Liber de Lude Aleae (a gambler's manual published after his death) Gerolamo Cardano wrote one of the first formal tracts to analyze the odds of winning at various games.|$|E
25|$|Air traffic {{controllers}} <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the disappearance from radar. Emergency services only {{became aware of}} the accident after 15minutes and did not know the circumstances for nearly an hour. First on the scene was a nurse living nearby, who had been alerted by the boys, and an ambulance crew that happened to be driving past. A male passenger who had survived the accident was discovered in the aircraft cabin, but died on arrival at Ashford Hospital without recovering consciousness. A young girl was also found alive but died at the scene; there were no other survivors. Altogether, 30 ambulances and 25 fire engines attended the accident.|$|E

25|$|So {{completely}} absorbed was {{the attention}} of the twelve pounder Battery No. 6, which stood in a somewhat isolated position, by the contest in Saint-Amand-la-Haye, which it covered by its fire, that it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the stealthy advance of a Troop of the French horsemen, wearing the uniform of the Light Artillery of the Guard, and most unexpectedly found itself attacked in flank by these bold adventurers. This give rise to a curious scene, for the Prussian Gunners, in the first moment of surprise, could only defend themselves with their rammers and handspikes; but with these they plied the intruders with so much adroitness and resolution as to hurl their leaders to the ground, and force the remainder to hasty flight.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{was trying}} {{to break up a}} group of late revelers {{shooting}} at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He attempted to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> that Brocius' pistol was already on the ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and cover versions in the episode attracted generally positive reviews, {{though a few}} reviewers noted that the program had been on for twenty-three minutes before the first song appeared. While Fallon {{said it was an}} [...] "interminable wait" [...] for the first musical number, [...] "Ohio", and Reiter cited the delay as flaw, James Poniewozik of Time thought it a [...] "credit to the episode" [...] that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the absence of music to that point. Flandez and Futterman commented favorably on all the musical numbers, though Canning felt the songs were a [...] "disappointing aspect of this episode", and none were [...] "exceptionally memorable".|$|E

500|$|Before {{writing a}} game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire {{outline of the}} story, before {{exploring}} the narrative more intricately, discussing the [...] "moment-to-moment beats" [...] of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with {{the middle of the}} story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development. The Frame host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including A Second Chance at Sarah and The Last of Us, is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s the {{presence}} of women in rock, and in particular in heavy metal bands, was usually considered by press and fans more for glamour and sexual exploitation than for the musicianship showed. Doro Pesch {{was one of the}} few exceptions; her qualities as vocalist and songwriter in Warlock, her commitment in promoting their music and her avoidance of posturing as a sex symbol won the respect of a solid fan base in the expanding European metal scene of that period, ensuring a long string of favorable articles and covers on the principal European metal magazines. In an interview in 2006 Doro remembered how [...] "we lived in paradise and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> it, (...) we thought at the time, that now it goes on and on and the success would continue automatically, (...) then came the great awakening".|$|E
500|$|When Johnston {{arrived on}} January 28 {{to take his}} seat, he had some difficulty. George F. Edmunds of Vermont {{questioned}} whether he was the right Mr. Johnston and thought a fraud was being perpetrated until Waitman T. Willey of West Virginia vouched for Johnston's identity, allowing his qualification. Later, {{he was in the}} process of signing a document put before him, but without having read it. This was the ironclad oath, that required all white males to swear they had never borne arms against the Union or supported the Confederacy. If the senator sitting next to Johnston, Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed,</b> Johnston would likely have been [...] "disgraced ... forever in the eyes of the people of Virginia". The oath had been deemed unconstitutional in 1867, but its use was not effectively ended until 1871. At this time, Johnston was the only senator who had sided with the Confederacy—all the rest were either Northerners by birth or had been [...] "Union men".|$|E

500|$|The IPCC {{told reporters}} that the {{post-mortem}} showed no bruising or scratches on Tomlinson's head and shoulders. When the family asked the City of London police, after the post-mortem, whether there had been marks on Tomlinson's body, they were told no; according to The Guardian, Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton, who was leading the investigation, wrote in his log {{that he did not}} tell the family about a bruise and puncture marks on Tomlinson's leg to avoid causing [...] "unnecessary stress or alarm." [...] On 5 April The Observer published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police. After it was published, Freddy Patel was asked to return to the mortuary, where he made a note of bruising on Tomlinson's head that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> when he first examined him. On 24 April Sky News obtained an image of Tomlinson after he collapsed, which showed bruising {{on the right side of}} his forehead.|$|E
500|$|The MiGs were [...] below Davis and Littlefield and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> them. Without hesitating, Davis {{immediately}} flew {{behind the}} MiG-15 formation and attacked {{them from the}} rear. His surprise attack destroyed one of the MiG-15s, and he quickly turned to the next closest MiG and destroyed it before it could outmaneuver him. By this time, Davis and Littlefield passed many of the MiGs and some that were behind them began firing. Davis then moved to target a third MiG {{at the front of}} the formation, but as he was lining up his shot a MiG scored a direct hit on Davis' fuselage, causing his aircraft to spin out of control. Littlefield said later, that he spotted Davis' landing gear open, indicating hydraulic failure, and that he attempted to defend Davis' aircraft as it lost altitude until Davis crashed and died. Littlefield reported he did not see Davis bail out of his aircraft. Davis was declared missing in action and presumed killed. Intense aerial searches of the area later revealed no evidence that Davis had survived the crash. In fact, a week after the incident, the Chinese military searched the region and recovered Davis' body, still in the crashed aircraft. Despite the Chinese discovery of Davis' remains, his body was never returned to the United States.|$|E
500|$|Mohun {{frequently}} {{came into}} conflict with the native tribesmen. [...] When his mail bag and personal papers were stolen and a local chief refused to return them he proceeded to wage war on the chief accompanied by four gunmen and a steamboat. [...] Mohun attacked and burnt at least ten villages before he captured the chief's son whom he threatened to hang. [...] In return for his son's life the chief returned the mail bag, alongside a second that Mohun <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> was missing. [...] Another time, seeking to view the native method of making cloth, he visited a remote town accompanied by only six followers covertly armed with revolvers. [...] The party came under attack by spears and poisoned arrows. [...] Having fought off their assailants Mohun captured the town and [...] "burned {{it to the ground}} to teach them a lesson". [...] Mohun was always conscious of his public image and wrote a diary with a view to later publication. [...] Mohun's diary contains {{little in the way of}} self-criticism and he reflects upon his responsibility for this incident by stating that he was [...] "satisfied in my own conscience that I had rid the country of a brute and unnecessary member of society." [...] On another occasion he witnessed the funeral of a local chief who had four of his wives and 10 slaves buried alive with him. [...] Mohun was unable to intervene, in spite of his horror at the situation, as he had only a small escort and was heavily outnumbered.|$|E

When {{he was asked if}} Meinhof had been isolated {{by the rest of the}} prisoners he answered, [...] "I am not aware of that fact." [...] Jailer Renate Frede and prison official Horst Bubeck reported that they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> any strange or unusual behaviour, or conflicts among the prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|In this match, Cho {{was ahead}} and was {{determined}} not to let anything stop him from beating O Meien. It was move 145, and both players were in overtime. To Cho's surprise, the referee of the match, Kentaro Yamamato started counting down the seconds for Cho's move. Cho <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> that it was his move from all the intense concentration of making the right move. He was saddened, greatly. He kept asking himself [...] "Why?". He would keep repeating to Yamamoto, [...] "Was it my turn?". After the incident, Cho left the room, weeping. The referees finally decided that Cho in fact had lost, while on the board he was ahead. 39–26 was the record for 2002.|$|E

2500|$|The {{colourful}} term [...] "ultraviolet catastrophe" [...] {{was given}} by Paul Ehrenfest in 1911 to the paradoxical result that the total energy in the cavity tends to infinity when the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics is (mistakenly) applied to black body radiation. But this had not been part of Planck's thinking, because he had not tried to apply the doctrine of equipartition: {{when he made his}} discovery in 1900, he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> any sort of [...] "catastrophe". It was first noted by Lord Rayleigh in 1900, and then in 1901 by Sir James Jeans; and later, in 1905, by Einstein when he wanted to support the idea that light propagates as discrete packets, later called 'photons', and by Rayleigh and by Jeans.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1982, Kit Williams {{received}} a sketch which he {{recognized as the}} first correct solution mailed to him. Williams immediately phoned the sender, [...] "Ken Thomas", a pseudonym of Dugald Thompson, and instructed him to dig for the hare. He realized that Thompson had not solved the puzzle in the intended manner, but appeared {{at the time to}} have blundered into a lucky guess. Shortly after Thompson was formally awarded the prize, Williams {{received a}} correct solution sent by two physics teachers, Mike Barker of William Hulme's Grammar School and John Rousseau of Rossall School. Barker and Rousseau had seemingly unearthed the prize themselves when digging at Ampthill, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> it inside its clay box; Thompson discovered it in the dirt piles they left behind.|$|E
2500|$|The 48th Brigade recaptured {{the wood}} and {{a few hours later}} the Lone How was {{discovered}} intact, the fuze having gone out. The howitzer was so well camouflaged, that the German raiders <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> it. British artillery-fire was believed to have destroyed some German gas cylinders, when German troops were seen to climb out of their front trenches and run to the rear, amid British small-arms fire. Eighty dead German soldiers were counted later, in and around the British front trenches. By [...] the German raid was over and during the night, two British battalions were relieved; the rest of 28 April was quiet, except for a raid by the 1st Division, at the Double Crassier near Loos. At [...] a German artillery bombardment and gas discharge began on the 16th Division front but the expected attack did not occur.
