50|$|In 1884, Eastman {{patented}} {{the first}} <b>film</b> <b>in</b> <b>roll</b> form to prove practicable; {{he had been}} tinkering at home to develop it. In 1888, he perfected the Kodak Black camera, the first camera designed. Eastman was progressive for his era. He promoted Florence McAnaney to be head of the personnel department, {{one of the first}} women to hold an executive position in a major U.S. company.|$|E
40|$|Film archivists {{have the}} option of storing film in a climate {{controlled}} macro-environment or in a micro-environment. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the latter to control the stability of cellulose triacetate base <b>film</b> <b>in</b> <b>roll</b> form. It does not consider other factors such as equipment cost, maintenance, labor expense and accessibility. The use of vented cans to reduce the acidity of degraded film was not effective in controlling “vinegar syndrome. ” The addition of buffered cardboard disks to adsorb acid is not recommended. Micro-environments in which the film was previously moisture conditioned to a low relative humidity, or else the addition of desiccants such as molecular sieves or silica gel did retard further degradation. The improvement obtained with molecular sieves and silica gel was due to both their moisture adsorbing and acid adsorbing properties. However, neither material was effective at reducing the acid level of already degraded film. Macro-environments have the potential to be of much greater benefit for film stability than the micro-environments evaluated in this paper. Micro-environments are of great value when {{it is not possible to}} obtain humidity control of the storage area. ...|$|E

He explained that he assumed the cameramen decided to shoot more than {{they were asked to}} as they had the cameras and 'nobody seemed bothered'. It is presumed that this footage is 35mm <b>film.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone magazine, Waters expresses that the footage would [...] "undoubtedly" [...] be released to the public.|$|R
5000|$|Blair's {{new company}} {{supplied}} European filmmaking pioneers, including Birt Acres, Robert Paul, George Albert Smith, Charles Urban, and the Lumiere Brothers. By 1896 {{the new movie}} projector required a fully transparent film base that Blair's American operation could not supply. Eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock. Louis Lumiere worked with Victor Planchon to adapt the Lumiere [...] "Blue Label" [...] (Etiquette Bleue) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid <b>roll</b> <b>film,</b> which began <b>in</b> early 1896. Eastman's first motion picture film stock was offered in 1889. At first the film {{was the same as}} photographic film. By 1916, separate [...] "Cine Type" [...] films were offered. From 1895, Eastman supplied their motion picture <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> of 65 feet, while Blair's rolls were 75 feet. If longer lengths were needed, the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a darkroom, but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers. The makers of Actuality films were much more eager to undertake this method, however, in order to depict longer actions, and created cemented rolls as long as 1000 feet. American Mutoscope and Biograph was the first known company to use this for the Jeffries-Sharkey fight on November 3, 1899.|$|R

It was a <b>film</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> nitrate support found {{in a state of}} decay that {{produced}} irreversible injuries in the image, and contained about a sixth part of the full footage. from that footage, restored in year 1993, were saved 93 meters.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{practical and}} commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumière Autochrome, introduced in 1907. This was an additive method, using a panchromatic emulsion coated on a thin glass plate previously {{coated with a}} layer of dyed potato starch grains. Autochrome plates were discontinued in the 1930s, after the introduction of Lumière Filmcolor <b>in</b> sheet <b>film</b> and Lumicolor <b>in</b> <b>roll</b> <b>film</b> sizes. Also using the additive principle and reversal processing were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961.|$|R
2500|$|Sympathy for the Devil is {{also the}} title of a producer's edit of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard whose own {{original}} version is called One Plus One. [...] The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the <b>Rolling</b> Stones <b>in</b> the process of recording the song in the studio. On the <b>filming,</b> Jagger said <b>in</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a <b>film</b> of us <b>in</b> the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Social Network {{received}} widespread acclaim, with critics praising its direction, screenplay, acting, {{editing and}} score. Although several people portrayed <b>in</b> the <b>film</b> criticized its historical inaccuracies, the film appeared on 78 critics' Top 10 lists for 2010; of those critics, 22 had the <b>film</b> <b>in</b> their number-one spot, {{the most of}} any <b>film</b> <b>in</b> its year. <b>Rolling</b> Stones Peter Travers said [...] "The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade." [...] It was also Roger Ebert's selection for the best film of the year.|$|R
5000|$|Polaroid cameras can be {{classified}} {{by the type of}} film they use. The earliest Polaroids (pre-1963) used instant roll <b>film.</b> <b>Roll</b> <b>film</b> came <b>in</b> two <b>rolls</b> (positive/developing agent and negative) which were loaded into the camera and was eventually offered in three sizes (40, 30, and 20 series). The next generation of Polaroid cameras used 100 series [...] "pack film," [...] where the photographer pulled the film out of the camera, then peeled apart the positive from the negative {{at the end of the}} developing process. Pack film initially was offered in a rectangular format (100 series), then in square format (80 series). Third generation Polaroids, like the once popular SX-70, used a square format integral <b>film,</b> <b>in</b> which all components of the film (negative, developer, fixer, etc.) were contained. Each exposure developed automatically once the shot was taken. SX-70 (or Time Zero) film had a strong following with artists who used it for image manipulation.|$|R
40|$|UltraSail is a {{next-generation}} ultra-large (km 2 class) sail system. Analysis of the launch, deployment, stabilization, {{and control}} of these sails shows that high-payload-mass fractions for interplanetary and deep-space missions are possible. UltraSail combines propulsion and control systems developed for formation-flying microsatellites with a solar sail architecture to achieve controllable sail areas approaching 1 km 2. Electrically conductive CP- 1 polyimide <b>film</b> results <b>in</b> sail subsystem area densities as low as 5 g/m 2. UltraSail produces thrust levels many times those of ion thrusters used for comparable deep-space missions. The primary innovation involves the near-elimination of sail-supporting structures by attaching each blade tip to a formation- flying microsatellite, which deploys the sail and then articulates the sail to provide attitude control, including spin stabilization and precession of the spin axis. These microsatellite tips are controlled by microthrusters for sail-film deployment and mission operations. UltraSail also avoids the problems inherent <b>in</b> folded sail <b>film,</b> namely stressing, yielding, or perforating, by storing the <b>film</b> <b>in</b> a <b>roll</b> for launch and deployment. A 5 -km long by 2 micrometer thick film roll on a mandrel with a 1 m circumference (32 cm diameter) has a stored thickness of 5 cm. A 5 m-long mandrel can store a film area of 25, 000 m 2, and a four-blade system has an area of 0. 1 sq km...|$|R
5000|$|In latter years, [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] proved not to {{be popular}} with readers of Rolling Stone magazine; nor did it become popular with Kate Winslet, who played Rose DeWitt Bukater - the {{notional}} protagonist of the song - <b>in</b> the <b>film.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, <b>Rolling</b> Stone readers rated it the 7th worst song of the '90s, with the magazine writing, [...] "Celine Dion's song and the movie have aged very poorly...Now song probably just makes you cringe". Winslet stated that the song made her feel [...] "like throwing up", due to people's tendency to start playing it when she was around: [...] "I wish I could say, 'Oh listen, everybody! It's the Celine Dion song!' But I don't. I just have to sit there, you know, kind of straight-faced with a massive internal eye roll." [...] The Atlantic attributed the song's decline in popularity to its overexposure and added {{that over the years}} there have been many jokes that parody the song's lyrics by claiming [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] goes [...] "on and on and on". Vulture reasoned that it has become fashionable to dislike the song because it [...] "encapsulates most everything that once-enthusiastic moviegoers now dislike about Titanic: It's outdated, cheesy, and overly dramatic". Maxim deemed it [...] "the second most tragic event ever to result from that fabled ocean liner".|$|R
50|$|The same year, {{producer}} Ruby Tiong Tan {{was contacted}} by the Cannes Film Festival's artistic adviser Pierre Rissiant, informing her that the film had been selected as Best Foreign Film entry. Tiong Tan, along with the film's lead figures, Koronel and Brocka, traveled to France to compete. She reportedly smuggled the <b>film</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> her luggage to prevent customs officers from confiscating them. She had managed to add English subtitles beforehand. At the 1978 Cannes gathering, the film premiered during the festival's Directors' Fortnight section to critical acclaim, {{and went on to}} become the first Philippine film shown at Cannes. Koronel's performance earned her an appearance on the cover of the French daily Le Monde. In the United States the film was not as well-received at its premiere.|$|R
40|$|Magnetron-PECVD is a {{new process}} tool which allows the {{deposition}} of plasma polymer coatings at process pressures below 1 Pa. The striking features of this technology are the relatively easy realisation of large area deposition {{as well as the}} possibility of the combination with sputtering processes for multilayer coating designs. SiOxC„ coatings were deposited on PET <b>film</b> <b>in</b> a roll-to <b>roll</b> deposition machine. Dynamic deposition rates as high as 160 nm-m/min was achieved. Detailed results of deposition rates and of process reliability will be presented. The coatings were analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This method identifies the existence of both chain-like and network-like Si-O bonding in the layer. The results show how the layer properties are linked to the plasma parameters of the deposition process. The properties will be compared to sputtered SiC> 2 and to RF~ PECVD. Magnetron-PECVD can be tuned by different kinds of monomer inlets. Investigations with the monomer hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and with the monomer tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) will be presented...|$|R
50|$|Since {{this process}} {{produces}} neither enlargements nor reductions, {{the image on}} the print is exactly the same size as {{the image on the}} negative. Contact prints are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 <b>film</b> <b>rolls)</b> <b>in</b> order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common negative size for popular cameras) and larger film, contact prints are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, contact prints are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using contact prints in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.|$|R

50|$|The {{process for}} tinting was laborious, {{although}} simple in principle. Editing was done <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> based on tint color, with numbered frames of <b>film</b> <b>in</b> between scenes for later assembly. Once these rolls were printed and processed from the negative, they were immersed in aniline dyes, specified to the colors that were {{listed in the}} script or continuity. Hardening fixer was not used on the <b>film</b> <b>in</b> order for the dye to be imbibed into the emulsion quicker and with better results. Once the film had dried on large film drums, it would be assembled in correct order and rewound onto reels for shipping. Toning was similar, but instead of aniline dyes, the <b>film</b> was immersed <b>in</b> chemicals to change the silver image into colored salts.|$|R
