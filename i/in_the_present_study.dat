50|$|The {{analysis}} of the submitochondrial localization of RDH13 indicates its association with the inner mitochondrial membrane. The primary structure of RDH13 contains two hydrophobic segments, 2-21 and 242-261, which are sufficiently long to serve as transmembrane segments; however, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> alkaline extraction completely removes the protein from the membrane, indicating that RDH13 is a peripheral membrane protein.
