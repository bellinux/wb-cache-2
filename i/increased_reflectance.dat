However, increasing NH 4 OH content can greatly improve the effective minority carrier lifetime. This means increasing the NH 4 OH content in mixed solution can improve the electrical properties of b-Si without sacrificing the optical properties.|$|E
30|$|Figure  9 {{shows that}} {{luminous}} efficacy increases with increasing particle size. The {{reason is the}} same as for the YAG phosphor (see Section YAG): small particles exhibit more backscattering and the backscattered radiation is sent back and absorbed by the blue LED chip. Moreover, smaller particle surfaces are also more seriously affected by material defects in their microstructure. Latter effect is attributed to a stop in crystal formation. This effect results in <b>increased</b> <b>reflectance</b> for the case of smaller particles. Therefore, the luminous efficacy of the PC-LED decreases.|$|E

Vermilion has a reflectance transition edge near 590  nm (can range from 585 to 600  nm) and high reflectance at longer wavelengths [36]. The red spectrum is thus likely a mixture of red ochre with vermilion, and maps mainly to regions of David’s garment, thought to be painted in the first stage.|$|E

Oil and water background show steadily <b>increasing</b> <b>reflectance</b> spectrum between wavelength 475 - 675 nm, while they have different level of absorption in 675 - 800 nm, thus, information of oil spill could be extracted by band ratio of B 4 /B 2 and B 3 /B 2 [8]. There is a decrease in water background reflection from 550 - 750 nm; so to get some information on background the difference of bands 3 and 2 can be applied.

40|$|Uraniferous bitumens from Great Britain, Scandinavia nd South Africa {{have been}} studied by oil-immersion reflected-light {{microscopy}} and categorised into those formed either by replacement ofpre-existing uraninite and pitchblende or by complexation/reduction mechanisms in pre-existing hydrocarbons. The former are characterised by displaying normal replacive textures, and containing high concentrations of non-mineral-bound uranium, or later, occasionally exotic, uraniferous fracture-filling phases. Uraniferous bitumens formed during complexation/reduction reactions display monotonous mineralogies and ordered mineral-inclusion distributions. Radiolytic alteration of uraniferous bitumens induces both chemical and mechanical alteration. Early alteration is marked by the generation of mobile hydrocarbons during 'cracking reactions ' with subsequent within-sample migration to form globular bitumens and dendritic interspersions ofmineral-rich and-poor uraniferous bitumen. Mobile hydrocarbons may act as lubricants during mechanical deformation. Advanced organic alteration is characterised by well-documented <b>increased</b> <b>reflectance</b> around uraniferous grains, and by fracturing of the bitumens.
