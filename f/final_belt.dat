500|$|While the album's {{development}} was underway, Carey {{expressed interest in}} working with Jermaine Dupri, whom {{she had been a}} fan of since his 1992 song, [...] "Jump". Soon after, Carey, Dupri, and Manuel Seal began composing a song for the album, with Carey and Dupri becoming close friends and frequent collaborators on later albums. As Seal played the piano, Carey began humming and playing with certain notes in the B-section, until she came up with the chorus for [...] "Always Be My Baby". After the rest of the song was written and composed, Carey recorded the song alongside longtime background singers Kelly Price, Shanrae Price, and Melonie Daniels. Together, they built [...] "a wall of background voices" [...] in which she would cover with her <b>final</b> <b>belting</b> notes. The song featured a downbeat rhythm, while its composition was described as [...] "sassy and soft R" [...] which displayed a [...] "sexy and slow jam".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The ring-collapse {{mechanism}} of C 24 (D 6 d) has been analyzed using semiempirical AM 1 and B 3 LYP/cc-pVDZ methods. Based on the ring-stacking/circumscribing model, two precursors are selected. Transition states and intermediates are located and energetics are computed. Before the stacking begins, the precursor and belt reach a suitable relative orientation {{accompanied by the}} release of a large amount of energy. It is observed that the reactions between the precursors and the belts are essentially endoergic in nature, whereas the reactions between the stable intermediates and the <b>final</b> <b>belts</b> are exoergic. The deformation energies (DE) and the bond lengths R of the precursors have been computed. The DE values suggest that there is a chance of the cleavage of the bicyclic precursors as the growth process proceeds toward the cage formation. In contrast, the monocyclic precursor is found to have lower deformation energies than the bicyclic precursor. Analysis of average bond length at different cages shows that a large window is formed and the system appears to follow a cascade-type bond formation. Comparisons are made to our previous result...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} mine one typical non-sphere cluster, the linear belts in a spatial database, a {{mathematical}} morphological operator based method is proposed in this paper. The method {{can be divided}} into two basic steps: firstly, the most suitable re-segmenting scale is found by our clustering algorithm MSCMO which is based on mathematical morphological scale space; secondly, the segmented result at this scale is re-segmented to obtain the <b>final</b> linear <b>belts.</b> This method is a robust mining method to semi-linear clusters and noises, which is validated by the successful extraction of seismic belts...|$|R
50|$|The Vulcan 500 (EN500A) {{introduced}} in 1990 was {{the successor to}} the Kawasaki 454 LTD. The EN500A was fitted with a parallel twin 498 cc engine nearly identical to the Kawasaki Ninja 500R. It had a 6 speed transmission and <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive. The EN500A was discontinued after 1996 and replaced with the Vulcan 500 LTD (EN500C). Both versions were available as 1996 models. With the EN500C the ergonomics changed {{as well as the}} engine tuning. New cam shaft profiles and slightly lower compression pistons moved the power band down to increase low end torque. Also the carburetors were downsized from 34mm to 32mm. The <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive was replaced with a chain. The Vulcan 500 LTD was discontinued after the 2009 model year for a nearly 20 year production run.|$|R
50|$|The Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns and the Arkansas State Red Wolves both {{finished}} 5-2 {{and were}} co-champions of the Sun Belt Conference. The Ragin' Cajuns earned the conference's first bowl {{spot in the}} R+L Carrier New Orleans Bowl, as Louisiana-Lafayette defeated Tulane 24-21 to win their 3rd straight New Orleans Bowl. Arkansas State earned the second and <b>final</b> Sun <b>Belt</b> bowl, as they played in the GoDaddy Bowl. Arkansas State scored a late touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}} to upset Ball State, who entered the game with a 10-2 record, and win their second straight GoDaddy Bowl.|$|R
50|$|Sadly, 1998 proved much of {{the same}} for Shaw, but without the rousing finish. Instead, another bright start paved the way for some heavy losses midseason, {{successive}} victories in rounds 15 and 16 over Geelong and Hawthorn in the wet the club’s <b>final</b> opportunity to <b>belt</b> out its favourite tune until round eight of 1999.|$|R
50|$|From 1907 a 350 cc Douglas {{version was}} on sale, {{similar to the}} Fairy with the engine in-line mounted high in the frame, but without the chain driven {{countershaft}} beneath, and with <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive. Around 1911 the frame was modified to make the engine lower, and in 1912 the automatic inlet valves were replaced by mechanically operated valves.|$|R
5000|$|The Mercury was a cyclecar {{built in}} Detroit, Michigan, by the Mercury Cyclecar Company in 1914. The Mercury had a {{self-supporting}} body that eliminated {{the need for}} a chassis frame. The vehicle was equipped with a two-cylinder air-cooled [...] engine. It used a friction transmission and <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive. Body styles were monocar, tandem two-seater and light van.|$|R
50|$|The Simplic was a cyclecar {{manufactured}} from 1914 onwards by George Wadden in Surrey, England. Wadden was {{a hairdresser}} {{who took over}} the business that had produced the Autotrix. The first Simplic was a 4-wheeled vehicle powered by a 5/6 hp air-cooled JAP engine. Transmission was by epicyclic gear and <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive. Production stopped later that year due to World War I.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} may be divided into belts: the common oak belt which is now covered (apart from the mesóla forest) with fruit {{orchards}} and fields of wheat and sugar beet, the pubescent and Adriatic oak belts on the lower slopes up to 900 m, the beech belt between 1,000 and 1,500 m and the <b>final</b> mountain heath <b>belt.</b>|$|R

The song featured a [...] "'70s soul vibe" [...] as well as synthetic record scratches, in order to the give the song an authentic '70s sound. Carey felt the additions were simple steps taken to further display a contemporary R&B groove. Additionally, she felt the song paid homage to the style of Minnie Riperton, who was one of Carey's biggest vocal influences growing up. The song had a soft sound, and had [...] " [...] of texture" [...] and bass, showing a more creative side to Carey.|$|R

5000|$|The 2011 Tokyo Motor Show {{included}} a retrofuturistic concept motorcycle from Yamaha, designed {{along the lines}} of the 1955 YA-1. The Y125 Moegi is powered by an air-cooled 125cc single-cylinder engine (although this new engine is an SOHC four-stroke) sitting in an aluminum frame for a claimed weight of just 80 kg, which makes the [...] significantly lighter than the YA-1 was. The Moegi uses a low-maintenance <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive and rides on 20-inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|After this, the Thrillers began {{chasing the}} World Tag Team Championship while Reno {{took a more}} {{reserved}} role. On October 2, 2000, Reno began pursuing the Hardcore Championship, losing to Sgt. AWOL in a tournament <b>final</b> for the <b>belt.</b> Fellow Thriller member Mike Sanders, who was WCW's Commissioner at the time, reversed the decision, however, and gave the win and the title to Reno instead. He then defeated AWOL at Halloween Havoc to retain the title.|$|R
60|$|A bearskin-coated {{policeman}} stepped prominently to the fore, {{watch in}} hand. Men hurried among the dogs, rousing {{them to their}} feet, untangling their traces, straightening them out. The entries came to the mark, firmly gripping stakes and notices. They had gone over {{the boundaries of the}} claim so often that they could now have done it blindfolded. The policeman raised his hand. Casting off their superfluous furs and blankets, and with a <b>final</b> cinching of <b>belts,</b> they came to attention.|$|R
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the third drop the boat passes under the lift hill and is {{launched}} uphill a third time. The boat turns left before it drops down under the lift hill. At this point the boat glides uphill and into a left-hand, 270° turn. The boat then travels downhill before going back uphill, this time over the lift hill. After going down hill and uphill one more time, the boat enters a right-turning helix. Once the boat has navigated the helix, it makes a left turn before dropping a final time. At the conclusion of the drop it lands in a splash pool of water, floating in a current with mild rapids for several yards before making a left turn to line up with the end-of-the-ride conveyor <b>belt.</b> The <b>final</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> brings the boat into the station, at which time riders unload.|$|R
5000|$|The Kawasaki Gpz305 was a [...] twin {{cylinder}} air-cooled SOHC four-stroke motorcycle, produced in 1983 to 1994 by Kawasaki in Japan. The model {{evolved from the}} earlier ER250 model and used an overbored 61 × 52.4 mm version of the 249 cc engine first produced in 1979. Kawasaki gave this model the [...] "Gpz" [...] nomenclature to add to its expanding air-cooled sports bike range, and was marketed as a sports machine. It originally had chain final drive but in 1983 it had a new Kevlar <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive first seen on Kawasaki's American styled cruisers.|$|R

50|$|The Blast was {{conceived}} as an entry-level motorcycle to attract newcomers to motorcycling {{in general and}} to Harley-Davidson in particular. As such, the design goals were low cost and ease of operation and maintenance. Steps to achieve these goals {{include the use of}} an automatically tensioned <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive, self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters, and a carburetor with an automatic choke. The engine design was borrowed from Harley's Evolution Sportster engine with the rear cylinder eliminated. The plastic bodywork pieces of the Blast were made from Surlyn, a substance used to make the outside of golf balls, to protect the surfaces when the Blast is dropped, and the color is molded-in.|$|R
40|$|Received; {{accepted}} – 2 – The recent {{discovery of}} the 2003 EL 61 collisional family in the Kuiper belt (Brown et al. 2007) is surprising {{because it is a}} highly improbable event in today’s belt. Assuming Brown et al. ’s estimate {{of the size of the}} progenitors, we find roughly a 1 in 10, 000 chance of such an impact over the age of the Solar System. In addition, it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a massive primordial Kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family would not have survived whatever event molded the <b>final</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> structure. Here we suggest that the family is the result of a collision between two scattered disk objects. We show that the probability that a collision occurred between two such objects similar in size to those advocated in Brown et al. (2007) and that the resulting collisional family landed in the Kuiper belt can be as large as 15 %, which, given the large uncertainties involved, is consistent with the fact that we see one family.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatial data mining method MCAMMO and its extension L_MCAMMO designed for discovering linear and near linear features in spatial databases. L_MCAMMO {{can be divided}} into two basic steps: first, the most suitable re-segmenting scale is found by MCAMMO, which is a scale space method with mathematical morphology operators; second, the segmented result at this scale is re-segmented to obtain the <b>final</b> linear <b>belts.</b> These steps are essentially a multi-scale binary image segmentation process, and can also be treated as hierarchical clustering if we view the points under each connected component as one cluster. The final number of clusters is the one which survives (relatively, not absolutely) the longest scale range, and the clustering which first realizes this number of clusters is the most suitable segmentation. The advantages of MCAMMO in general and L_MCAMMO in particular, are: no need to pre-specify the number of clusters, a small number of simple inputs, capable of extracting clusters with arbitrary shapes, and robust to noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated by the real-life experiments in the mining of seismic belts in China. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|R
50|$|The LS650 Savage was {{the first}} cruiser {{manufactured}} by Suzuki in 1986. The Kawasaki Vulcan 400 entry-level cruiser with a V-twin engine was introduced {{the same year as}} the Suzuki Savage, and the Vulcan 500 LTD with a parallel-twin engine was introduced in 1990. One of the few small cruiser motorcycles available with a shaft drive as an alternative to either chain or <b>belt</b> <b>final</b> drive, the Yamaha Virago 535 was introduced in 1987. Honda launched the Shadow VLX, with a 583 cc V-twin for the 1988 model year to compete with the single-cylinder Savage. The Savage's persona was a bike that stayed out of harm's way, with a torquey engine (although underpowered for its displacement) that made few demands on the rider.|$|R
