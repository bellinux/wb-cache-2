2500|$|The Prado {{version is}} set at dawn and shows the young Adonis pulling himself away from Venus, his lover. [...] He carries a {{feathered}} spear or [...] "dart", a weapon often used in hunting in the 16th century. The leads of his three hounds are wound around his arm at right. Under the trees behind them at left Cupid lies asleep, with his bow and quiver of arrows hanging from a tree; this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for love. [...] High in the sky, a figure rides a chariot; this is either Venus from later in the story, or Apollo or Sol, representing the dawn. [...] Venus sits on a rock covered with a rich tablecloth with gold braid edges and buttons (not a military jacket, as sometimes thought). [...] Adonis has a horn hanging from his belt; his dress is classical, taken from Roman sculptures.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cernat, his {{articles}} for Integral show Fondane {{as an ally}} of the [...] "anti-political" [...] and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in [...] "the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry". The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the [...] "cine-poems" [...] by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces [...] "amazing"). In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane {{did not believe in}} a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. [...] Poetry will be for the few—or it will not be at all." [...] Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: [...] "This is probably the closest that we can come to seeing contemporary poetry." [...] Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With Le Féstin de Balthazar, the writer modified his earlier Monologul by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque. Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, Philoctète reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas.|$|E

50|$|Despite uncertainties, {{especially}} for the period prior to 1600 for which data are scarce, the warmest period of the last 2,000 {{years prior to the}} 20th century in the Northern Hemisphere very likely occurred between 950 and 1100.

2500|$|Between 1900 and 1904, Taylor was {{president}} of the National Negro Democratic League. Southern Democrats were enacting laws that disfranchised most Black voters and were imposing segregation through “Jim Crow” laws. Northern Democrats seemed unwilling and/or unable to control the excesses of their Southern parties. The National Negro Democratic League was fractured by the debate over the issue of linking the nation’s currency to silver as well as to gold. By 1904, Taylor was positioned to abandon the party and bureau that he had led as president for two terms. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> good <b>time</b> to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Black democrat.

40|$|Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) {{document}} {{a positive}} trend in idiosyncratic volatility during the 1962 [...] 1997 period. We show that by 2003 volatility falls back to pre- 1990 s levels. Furthermore, {{we show that}} the increase and subsequent reversal is concentrated among firms with low stock prices and high retail ownership. This {{evidence suggests that the}} increase in idiosyncratic volatility through the 1990 s <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> trend but, rather, an episodic phenomenon, at least partially associated with retail investors. Results from cross-sectional regressions, conditional trend estimation, stock-split events, and "attention-grabbing" events are consistent with a retail trading effect. The Author 2009.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose a new index of {{antitrust}} enforcement. The index is compiled from quarterly {{data from the}} Department of Justice from 1890 to 1989 and is designed to reflect the relative influence of variables that have deterrent effects. The authors use Hamilton's (1989, 1990) regime-switching technique to estimate a model in which the enforcement index follows a regime-specific AR(1) process. The authors find evidence of long-lived regimes. The high enforcement regime, which lasted from about 1910 to the mid- 1960 s, produced enforcement that was, on average, almost {{twice as high as}} the low enforcement regime. In particular, the Reagan years <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of transition to low antitrust enforcement, as is commonly claimed. Rather, the transition to a low enforcement regime had taken place some 15 years earlier. Antitrust law...|$|R
