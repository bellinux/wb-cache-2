2500|$|Hellman was {{a member}} of the Communist Party from 1938–40, by her own account written in 1952, [...] "a most casual member. I {{attended}} very few meetings and saw and heard nothing more than people sitting around a room talking of current events or discussing the books they had read. <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> away from the Communist Party because I seemed to be in the wrong place. My own maverick nature was no more suitable to the political left than it had been to the conservative background from which I came." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanger said {{he found}} no {{evidence}} for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: [...] "My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult. I would need to see proof." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> on {{for about}} a quarter of a mile, and then I came in sight of a fishing-punt moored in mid-stream, in which sat two old fishermen. They saw me bearing down upon them, and they called out to me to keep out of their way.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> {{for three}} days, eating and {{drinking}} sparingly, and meditating upon all {{that had happened to}} me,--not desiring very greatly then to see men again. One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black tangle: no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman.|$|E

50|$|He {{was also}} active in film. His 1928 novel Something <b>Is</b> <b>Drifting</b> on the Water (Valamit visz a víz) was filmed twice. His play The General was filmed as The Virtuous Sin in 1930 and The Rebel in 1931.|$|R
6000|$|... "And off {{he went to}} the barn, leavin' me shakin' {{with his}} jolt. He was game all right! He figured me out as the prodigal son, and wa'n't goin' to knuckle. He {{intended}} for me to do all the knee exercise. <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> along up the path toward the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> {{along the}} road as a soap-bubble floats before the wind, or as a body floats in a dream. I floated along and I floated along past the trees, past the bushes, past the mill-pond, past the mill where the old miller {{stood at the door}} looking at me.|$|E
60|$|She {{rushed into}} his arms like someone {{charging}} in for a bowl of soup at a railway station buffet. And <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> out.

5000|$|When I Live by the Garden and the Sea is an EP {{from the}} Portland, Oregon based, ambient {{musician}} Matthew Cooper, {{under the name}} Eluvium. The song [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>Drift</b> Off" [...] opened with an audio fragment from the 1989 film, The 'Burbs.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>I,</b> <b>drifting</b> {{slowly up}} the lake {{into the sunset}} over the glassy water, was {{thinking}} how human it all was. [...] "Doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "After {{floating}} {{down the}} river for an hour, I saw {{the light of a}} few fires on the right bank, and guessed that this was a Dervish force, beleaguering Khartoum from that side. <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> on for another hour, drawing {{closer and closer to the}} shore, until I could see walls and forts; then I stripped off my Dervish frock, and swam ashore.|$|E
60|$|My girl's words {{fell upon}} {{me like a}} splash of cold water. I was savage with myself, for feeling uneasy in myself the moment she had spoken them--but so it was.

60|$|Not {{content with}} the wonders of Colorado <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> down to Santa Fé and Isleta, with Charles Francis Browne and Hermon MacNeill, and got finally to Holbrook, where we {{outfitted}} and rode away across the desert, bound for the Snake Dance at Walpi. It would seem that we had decided to share all there was of romance in the South West. They were as insatiate as I.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> {{across to}} the men's fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I found {{strategically}} greasing his feet by the blaze. There is nothing particularly lovely {{in the sight of}} a private thus engaged after a long day's march, but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the 'might, majesty, dominion, and power' of the British Empire which stands on those feet you take an interest in the proceedings.|$|E
60|$|Three {{years passed}} before I met Cynthia. I spent those years {{wandering}} in many countries. At last, as one {{is apt to}} do, <b>I</b> <b>drifted</b> back to London, and settled down again to a life which, superficially, was {{much the same as}} the one I had led in the days before I knew Audrey. My old circle in London had been wide, and I found it easy to pick up dropped threads. I made new friends, among them Cynthia Drassilis.|$|E

The odd-numbered layers were axial layers, and the even-numbered layers were alternating stereo layers.|$|R
