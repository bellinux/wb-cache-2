5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E

25|$|Unless {{the wall}} is {{designed}} to retain water, It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> proper drainage behind the wall in order to limit the pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve {{the stability of the}} material behind the wall. Drystone retaining walls are normally self-draining.|$|E
25|$|For {{purposes}} of cryptography the more bases a we test, i.e. if we pick a sufficiently large value of k, {{the better the}} accuracy of test. Hence the chance of the algorithm failing {{in this way is}} so small that the (pseudo) prime is used in practice in cryptographic applications, but for applications for which it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a prime, a test like ECPP or Pocklington should be used which proves primality.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} the time complexity of algorithms {{for the decision}} problem for the existential theory of the reals, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a measure of the}} size of the input. The simplest measure of this type is the length of a sentence: that is, the number of symbols it contains. However, in order to achieve a more precise analysis of the behavior of algorithms for this problem, it is convenient to break down the input size into several variables, separating out the number of variables to be quantified, the number of polynomials within the sentence, and the degree of these polynomials.|$|E

25|$|While DNA is most {{important}} for information storage, a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tools to send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together, as desired. Ideally the interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable when building devices stable over days or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as coiled coils, SH3 domain-peptide binding or SpyTag/SpyCatcher have helped to give such control. In addition {{it is important to}} be able to regulate protein-protein interactions in cells, such as with light (using Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domains) or cell-permeable small molecules by Chemically induced dimerization.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, many {{manufacturers}} have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so {{the formulation of}} a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with medium quality media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.|$|E
500|$|For {{simulating}} {{the behavior}} of crystals or other anisotropic materials, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> variants of the curve-shortening flow for which the speed of flow depends on the orientation of a curve {{as well as on}} its curvature. One way of doing this is to define the energy of a curve to be the integral of a smooth function [...] of its normal vectors, and form the gradient flow of this energy, according to which the normal speed at which the curve flows is proportional to an anisotropic analog of the curvature. This flow can be simulated by discretizing the curve as a polygon. In numerical experiments, initial curves appear to converge to the Wulff shape for [...] before shrinking to a point. Alternatively, one can let the curve flow with speed [...] where [...] is the (usual) curvature and [...] and [...] are smooth functions of the orientation [...] When [...] and [...] (so that the flow is invariant under point reflection), the resulting flow can be shown to obey the avoidance principle and an analog of the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem.|$|E

50|$|From the Iraqi standpoint, it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Western {{sources of}} {{military}} supply, {{to avoid becoming}} too dependent on the Soviet Union. In issues including the Syrian role in Lebanon, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and having a nonaligned movement separate from the Western and Soviet camps, French and Iraqi policy differed. Baathist ideology was fundamentally anticommunist.|$|R

50|$|Many {{conflicts}} causing homicides involve status conflicts, protecting reputation, {{and seemingly}} trivial insults. Steven Pinker {{in his book}} The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police it <b>was</b> very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge {{as well as for}} protecting reputation ("honor"). Pinker argues that the development {{of the state and the}} police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.|$|R

2500|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the scalp can produce an electric current within the brain that activates the motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts. [...] This technique is known as transcranial electrical motor potential (TcMEP) monitoring. [...] This technique effectively evaluates the motor pathways in {{the central nervous system}} during surgeries which place these structures at risk. [...] These motor pathways, including the lateral corticospinal tract, are located in the lateral and ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. [...] Since the ventral and dorsal spinal cord have separate blood supply with very limited collateral flow, an anterior cord syndrome (paralysis or paresis with some preserved sensory function) is a possible surgical sequela, so it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> monitoring specific to the motor tracts as well as dorsal column monitoring.|$|E
