Don Juan José de Austria stood out due to his brave action, unleashing his might on the French quarters.

25|$|Waller's {{attack was}} not unexpected, and Prince Maurice had made {{ready to meet}} him. Yet, the first rush of the rebels carried the entrenchments of Speen Hill. Speen itself, though stoutly defended, fell into their hands within an hour, Essex's {{infantry}} recapturing here some of the guns they had had to surrender at Lostwithiel. But meantime, Manchester, {{in spite of the}} entreaties of his staff, had not stirred from Clay Hill. He had already made one <b>false</b> <b>attack</b> early in the morning, and been severely handled, he was aware of his own deficiencies as a general.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick seemed {{baffled by}} Hoche's clumsy attack on his army. In his {{subsequent}} actions the Prussian failed to fully cooperate with his colleague Wurmser. Despite its defeat, {{the morale of}} the Army of the Moselle was unaffected. The French soldiers remained sure of themselves, perhaps because of their capture of enemy-held territory before the battle. Hoche fortified Pirmasens and Blieskastel and mounted a <b>false</b> <b>attack</b> against Brunswick. But this was a smokescreen to cover his real intentions which were to shift his strength against Wurmser's western flank. Already on 23 November, Philippe-Joseph Jacob's division was moved to Niederbronn-les-Bains. This was joined by Taponier's division on 5 December and Jean Grangeret's division a week later. On 22 December 1793, Hoche defeated Wurmser in the Battle of Froeschwiller.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. ProVerif over-approximates the attacker’s {{power to}} enable {{verification}} of processes under replication. Unfortunately, {{this results in}} ProVerif finding <b>false</b> <b>attacks.</b> This problem is particularly common in protocols whereby a participant commits to a particular value and later reveals their value. We introduce a method to reduce <b>false</b> <b>attacks</b> when analysing secrecy. First, we show how inserting phases into non-replicated processes enables a more accurate translation to Horn clauses which avoids some <b>false</b> <b>attacks.</b> Secondly, we generalise our methodology to processes under replication. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our technique by analysing BlueTooth Simple Pairing. Moreover, we propose a simplification of this protocol that achieves the same security goal. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. First-order logic {{resolution}} {{is a standard}} way to automate the verification of security protocols. However, it sometimes fails to produce security proofs for secure protocols because of the detection of <b>false</b> <b>attacks.</b> For the verification of a bounded number of sessions, <b>false</b> <b>attacks</b> can be avoided by introducing rigid variables. Unfortunately, this yields complicated resolution procedures. We show here {{that there is a}} simple translation of the security problem for a bounded number of sessions into first-order logic, that does not introduce <b>false</b> <b>attacks.</b> This is shown by translating clauses involving rigid variables into classical first-order clauses, while preserving satisfiability. We illustrate this approach by giving a complete and terminating strategy for a first-order logic fragment resulting from the above translation, that yields a decision procedure for a bounded number of sessions. ...|$|R
25|$|On 15 June 1702, Louis of Baden {{left his}} camp at Langenkandel and {{advanced}} his entire army to {{the vicinity of}} Landau. He disposed his troops in six encampments around the fortress with his headquarters at Arzheim. In the siege which began on the 16th, three attacks were planned. Louis personally directed the main attack against the south gate. The counts of Nassau-Weilburg and Leiningen led the Palatine troops in a <b>false</b> <b>attack</b> against the earthworks on Queichausfluss while Thüngen commanded the attack against the Crownwork. Using their plentiful supply of ammunition, the French gunners delivered heavy and accurate fire on the Imperial trenching forces. In {{order to protect the}} working parties, the men were fitted with helmets and cuirasses borrowed from the heavy cavalrymen.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1792, the 12th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment was {{reviewed}} at Sedan by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, who {{fled to the}} Austrians {{a few days later}} after being accused of treason. On 19 August the Prussian army of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel attacked Longwy. On 23 August Longwy's 2,600-man French garrison surrendered to 13,731 Austrians with 48 guns and 18,200 Prussians with 88 guns. Verdun's garrison of 4,128 men capitulated to Brunswick on 2 September. In the crisis, the new French army commander Charles François Dumouriez sent Arthur Dillon with an advance guard including the 12th Chasseurs on a <b>false</b> <b>attack</b> toward Stenay. Dumouriez marched the main army south from Sedan, reaching Grandpré on 3 September while Dillon raced ahead to occupy Les Islettes. On 12 September Brunswick broke through Dumouriez's defenses at La Croix-aux-Bois by beating Jean-Pierre François de Chazot's division. While Chazot's troops were in retreat on 15 September, Prussian Hussars appeared. When the 12th Chasseurs attempted to stop them with pistol-fire, the enemy cavalry overran the regiment and sent Chazot's infantry fleeing. At the Battle of Valmy on 20 September, three squadrons of the 12th Chasseurs formed part of Dillon's Advance Guard.|$|E
500|$|After nightfall on October 6, troops {{moved out}} in stormy weather to dig the first parallel: the heavily {{overcast}} sky negated the waning full moon and shielded the massive digging operation {{from the eyes}} of British sentries. Washington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pick axe to begin the trench. The trench was to be [...] long, running {{from the head of}} Yorktown to the York River. Half of the trench was to be commanded by the French, the other half by the Americans. On the northernmost end of the French line, a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British ships in the river. The French were ordered to distract the British with a <b>false</b> <b>attack,</b> but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and the British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers redoubt.|$|E

2500|$|The Coalition columns were {{numbered}} {{from south}} to north. The 2nd Column was directed against Erquelinnes with the 1st Column guarding its right flank. After taking the village it would move east along the Sambre, capturing the bridges. Kaunitz ordered the 3rd Column to advance toward Lobbes, {{but if the}} French tried to move toward Binche, it would swing to its left, attacking their enemies from the rear. The 4th Column was to pass Péchant on its right, occupying the village with light infantry, and also head {{in the direction of}} Lobbes. The 5th Column would {{keep an eye on the}} French right flank and protect the Reserve. To divert the attention of the French in Maubeuge, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour made a <b>false</b> <b>attack</b> against Boussois at day-break with one battalion, one 12-pound cannon and two squadrons each of Austrian Chevau-légers and Dutch cavalry.|$|E

40|$|Ye et al. {{proposed}} the statistical en-route filtering scheme to address <b>false</b> data injection <b>attacks</b> {{in which an}} adversary uses compromised nodes to inject forged reports into the network {{with the goal of}} deceiving the base station or depleting the resources of the relaying nodes. This scheme can detect such forged reports but is vulnerable to <b>false</b> negative <b>attacks</b> during the report generation process. Thus, a legitimate event may not be reported properly. In this paper, we propose a report generation method to achieve resilience in terms of <b>false</b> negative <b>attacks</b> against the report generation process of the statistical en-route filtering scheme in ubiquitous sensor networks. In the proposed method, one of the detecting nodes randomly selects several nodes to generate sensing reports and key indices to generate message authentication codes (MACs). Each of the nodes selected to produce reports generates a sensing report which contains only the matched MACs, collected from different nodes, using the keys indicated by the key indices. We analyze the security level of the proposed method under various <b>false</b> negative <b>attacks</b> against the report generation process {{at the end of this}} paper. Key words: Ubiquitous sensor network, <b>false</b> negative <b>attacks,</b> <b>false</b> data filtering, security. 1...|$|R
