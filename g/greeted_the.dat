5|$|Rudd, Thompson and Maguire {{immediately}} went to present themselves to Lobengula, {{who came out}} from his private quarters without hesitation and politely <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> visitors. Through a Sindebele interpreter, Rudd introduced himself and the others, explained on whose behalf they acted, said they had come for an amiable sojourn, and presented the king with a gift of £100.|$|E
5|$|The {{first flight}} with {{passengers}} {{after the accident}} took place on 11 September 2001, landing shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in the United States. This was not a commercial flight: all the passengers were BA employees. Normal commercial operations resumed on 7 November 2001 by BA and AF (aircraft G-BOAE and F-BTSD), with service to New York JFK, where mayor Rudy Giuliani <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> passengers.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> {{players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E

5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the victory}} against Texas for the {{national}} championship, the team arrived at the Tuscaloosa Regional Airport {{on the evening of}} January 8. Several thousand fans were there to greet them upon their arrival. On January 16, a public national championship celebration at Bryant–Denny Stadium was attended by well over 30,000 spectators. Speakers at the event included head coach Nick Saban and Alabama athletic director Mal Moore. All of the championship trophies were available for public viewing. In early March, the team was invited to the White House, where Obama <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> team and offered congratulatory remarks for their championship season.|$|E
5|$|Game {{one took}} place at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba, on March 28, 1999. Tickets were {{distributed}} by invitation only. Angelos, Selig, and Castro sat together in box seats. One hundred schoolchildren from the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area also traveled to Cuba on a plane chartered by Angelos. Before the game, players and coaches on both teams engated in a flag ceremony. Castro <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> Orioles on the field, and gave his Cuban team a pep talk. Cuban baseball legend Conrado Marrero threw out the first pitch.|$|E

5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> {{players on the}} second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket {{and handed it to}} the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> {{players on the}} second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung {{the ball into the}} right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July 1840, PedroII was {{declared}} {{of age and}} Joaquim Inácio was among the naval officers representing the armada in the delegation that <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> young emperor. The rise of PedroII to head the central government resulted in a slow, but steady, restoration of order in the country. On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named inspetor do arsenal de marinha (inspector of the navy shipyard) in Rio Grande, {{the second most important}} town in Rio Grande do Sul. The province was still troubled by the Ragamuffin rebellion. He led the sailors manning the trenches surrounding Rio Grande and fought the Ragamuffins when they attacked the town in July 1841.|$|E

5|$|On {{its return}} to Britain the expedition's {{reception}} was initially muted. Markham was present {{to meet the}} ship in Portsmouth when Discovery docked there on 10 September 1904, but no dignitaries <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> party when it arrived in London a few days later. However, there was considerable public enthusiasm for the expedition, and official recognition followed. Scott was quickly promoted to Captain, and invited to Balmoral Castle to meet King Edward VII, who invested him as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). He also received a cluster of medals and awards from overseas, including the French Légion d'honneur. Polar Medals and promotions were given to other officers and crew members.|$|E
5|$|The liner {{arrived at}} Haifa on March 31, {{nearly a week}} late. Herman Hirsch {{reported}} that a passenger from Chicago, Jacob Drapekin, 72, had died aboard the ship on March 24. The man's dying wish was {{to be buried in}} the Holy Land, and the crew of President Arthur helped fulfill his wishes. After arrival in Haifa, his flag-draped coffin was placed on deck and services were conducted in English and Hebrew by Rabbi Ashinsky before the body was taken ashore for interment. A sizable crowd, comprising delegations from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Tel Aviv, <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> arriving ship. Most of the passengers on President Arthur were hurried to Jerusalem for the Hebrew University dedication ceremony the next day.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stop in}} Charleston, South Carolina, she {{continued}} south through the Caribbean Sea, arriving at Colón, Panama on 29 January. There, she joined the Special Service Squadron. This duty was interrupted twice; the first came in February, {{when she returned to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she {{and the rest of the}} Atlantic Fleet <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> Great White Fleet at the conclusion of its circumnavigation of the globe. The second came in April, owing to instability in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution that threatened American interests. Montana departed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 2 April, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to protect Americans in the region. She remained there until 23 July, when she left Gibraltar, arriving in Boston on 3 August. She thereafter returned to her normal operations patrolling the eastern coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> players on the second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E

5|$|I. C. Filitti {{was not in}} {{a celebratory}} mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the {{military}} ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted to stay behind in occupied territory, and <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other to stay behind in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.|$|E
5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|The ship then steamed {{back down}} to San Francisco in early July. There, she joined the Great White Fleet, which had {{departed}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, the previous year on {{the first leg of}} its global cruise. The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific, with a visit to Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships <b>greeted</b> <b>the</b> Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
