5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E
5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of six independent member states whose principal <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mark, record {{and maintain the}} graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars. The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who {{died as a result of}} enemy action during World War II. The Commission was founded by Fabian Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Sturtevant station's primary <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide {{residents}} of Racine County {{and the southern}} portions of the Milwaukee metropolitan area Amtrak service. The station is served only by the Amtrak Hiawatha Service, and sees fourteen daily arrivals, seven each from Milwaukee and Chicago Union Station. The station is the third stop en route to Chicago, with a travel time along the 23-mile (37-kilometer) section taking 28 minutes. It is also the third stop en route to Milwaukee, with a travel time along the 63-mile (101-kilometer) section taking one hour. For 2009, the station handled 71,369 passengers.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine {{the consequences of}} damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes {{and other types of}} brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to find answers, Vincent goes to the town of Nibelheim where Lucrecia studied Omega and Chaos. Whilst at Lucrecia's {{research}} lab, Vincent is ambushed by Rosso the Crimson, who steals the Protomateria but is prevented from killing Vincent by the arrival of Yuffie. As they return to the WRO headquarters, they find that Deepground has launched an assault on the base. However, Deepground member Shelke the Transparent has been captured by the WRO, and reveals that she is synaptically interconnected to Lucrecia's memories, thus allowing the WRO to complete Lucrecia's research on Omega. Shelke's sister, Shalua Rui, a high ranking scientist in the WRO, soon discovers that Omega is a WEAPON, which activates when the Planet senses that it is in mortal danger (like the WEAPONs it activated in the original Final Fantasy VII). Omega's <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> absorb the Lifestream from the Planet and then move to another planet, leaving the inhabitants behind to die. Deepground plans to slaughter a huge number of people at once so as to 'trick' the planet into activating Omega prematurely.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E
5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add to {{the flavor of the}} dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took {{inspiration}} for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types of machines are amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their frames are rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, if one of Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or dash quickly to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|E

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor has two constitutional functions. The primary <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{serve as the}} President of the Indiana Senate. In the Senate the {{lieutenant governor}} is permitted to debate on legislation, introduce legislation, and vote on matters to break ties. As presiding officer in the Senate, lieutenant governors also have partial control over what legislation will be considered, and influence on the legislative calendar. Unless a special session is called by the governor, the Senate meets {{for no more than}} 91 days in any two years period, leaving the lieutenant governor free from his or her senatorial duties in the remainder of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> divert turbulent {{boundary layer}} airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; {{it was found that the}} DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.|$|E
5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied <b>function</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E
