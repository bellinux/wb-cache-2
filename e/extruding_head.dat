5000|$|It was {{designed}} by Chapman and McGiffin Architects. Its construction started in 1912, ended in 1913 and the library opened for business on October 25, 1913. The original building {{was inspired by the}} classical architectural tradition and incorporates many elements of the Italian Renaissance architecture, such as round arches, supported by pilasters with <b>extruding</b> <b>head</b> stones on the façade; decorative pediments that echoed Ancient Greek Temples; ornamentation, which included non-structural brackets on the interior, two fireplaces with sculpted angel faces on both sides of each fireplace, natural motifs, etc.; a slightly hipped roof with what seems like an entablature, created with the use of brick ornamentation and terra cotta veneer; the attempt to create a [...] "perfect" [...] square-shaped plan of the library with barrel-vaulted ceilings and a courtyard. The library has undergone two major renovations. The first was done in 1975-1976 by architects Howard V. Walker and Howard D. Chapman, which mainly affected the plan of the library since the facade remained virtually intact. The second renovation was from 2006 to 2009. The architects involved in this project were Rounthwaite, Dick and Hadley Architects inc, Shoalts and Zaback, and ERA. As a result of this renovation, the library now has a [...] "glass box" [...] addition, its main entrance has been lowered by approximately half a metre and some of the interior features, such as the staircase, have been altered for functional reasons.|$|E
40|$|Cold working is {{the process}} of {{altering}} the shape or size of a metal by plastic deformation withthe temperature below the recrystallization point. It includes processes like rolling, drawing, pressing, spinning, <b>extruding</b> and <b>heading,</b> it is carried out below the recrystallization point usually at room temperature. Hardness and tensile strength are increased with the degree of cold work whilst ductility and impact values are lowered. Cold drawing of steel significantly improves surface finish. Though cold drawing is most oftenly used process it has some inherent problems faced during processing such as springback. This review paper focuses on springback phenomenon faced during different manufacturing processes in industries. This paper represents effects of various process parameters on springback conducted in past 20 years. This will help the researchers to get an insight about this phenomenon and guideline for further research in springback domain of manufacturing processe...|$|R

High strength, low relaxation {{steel wire ropes}} with minor radius, high tensile strain and good corrosion resistance were used in this reinforcement. The construction process for strengthening with prestressed steel wire ropes—including wire rope measuring, <b>extruding</b> anchor <b>heads</b> making, anchorage installing, tensioning steel wire ropes and pouring mortar was described. Ultimate bearing capacity of the bridge after strengthening was discussed based on the concrete structure theory. The flexural strength of RC T-beam bridges strengthened with prestressed steel wire ropes was governed by the failure of concrete crushing. To investigate effectiveness of the strengthening method, fielding-load tests were carried out before and after strengthening. The results of concrete strain and deflection show that the flexural strength and stiffness of the strengthened beam are improved. The crack width measurement also indicates that this technique could increase the durability of the bridge. Thus, this strengthened way with prestressed steel wire rope is feasible and effective...|$|R
