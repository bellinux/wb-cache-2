A failed rapid transit proposal published in 1928 by the Seattle Traffic Research Commission recommended that a future southern extension on Rainier Avenue terminate at either McClellan or Winthrop streets in Mount Baker.|$|E

5|$|Operationally and historically, {{the entire}} {{line from the}} Illawarra Junction at Redfern to its {{terminus}} in Bomaderry on the South Coast {{was known as the}} Illawarra Line. However, since 1989 CityRail has marketed the suburban services to Waterfall and Cronulla as the Illawarra line and <b>interurban</b> services south to Wollongong and Bomaderry as the South Coast Line. The line is coloured an azure blue on Sydney Trains timetables and other promotional materials.|$|E
5|$|Soon the Southern Illinois Railway and Power {{company was}} bought by the Central Illinois Public Service Company. The inter-urban line was {{abandoned}} in 1933 after 20 years of service. After the decommission of the <b>Interurban</b> line, Harrisburg opened the Harrisburg-Dorrisville Bus Co., which was a private predecessor bus company to the current Rides Mass Transit District which was opened in 1980. Between 1930 and 1940 the city lost 27% of its overall population.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between Toledo and ports north of Chicago, Illinois, from 1878 to 1982; however, the Ann Arbor Railroad also {{provided}} passenger service from 1878 to 1950. The city was served by the Michigan Central Railroad starting in 1837. The Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway, Michigan's first <b>interurban,</b> served the city from 1891 to 1929.|$|E

50|$|A tram, {{streetcar}} or {{trolley system}} is a rail-based transit system that runs mainly or completely along streets (i.e. with street running), with a relatively low capacity and frequent stops. Passengers usually board at street- or curb-level, although low-floor trams may allow level boarding. Longer-distance lines are called <b>interurbans</b> or radial railways. Few <b>interurbans</b> remain, most having been upgraded to commuter rail or light rail or abandoned.|$|R
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, several {{prominent}} buildings were {{constructed in the}} late 19th century, including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855, West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 (later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893), a public library in 1890, and the Right House department store in 1893. The first commercial telephone service in Canada, the first telephone exchange in the British Empire, and the second telephone exchange in all of North America were each established in the city between 1877–78. The city had several <b>interurban</b> electric street railways and two inclines, all powered by the Cataract Power Co.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{from its}} head office in Bishopbriggs and depots in Old Kilpatrick, Milngavie, Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Stepps and Cumbernauld, Kelvin Scottish had an {{operating}} area bounded by Loch Lomond to the west, Cumbernauld to the east, the Campsie Fells {{to the north}} and the River Clyde to the south. Kelvin was the largest operator in Dunbartonshire and north east Glasgow, and was responsible for urban, rural and <b>interurban</b> services. Its operating area had previously been served by Central SMT and Walter Alexander & Sons (Midland).|$|E
5|$|Taken at the {{suggestion}} of surveyor Sidney Smyth, Judge Harvey Cross decided to name a number of Gladstone streets after American colleges (e. g. University of California, Berkeley, Cornell University) and a number of United Kingdom dukes, earls, and universities (.e.g. University of Exeter, Earl of Dartmouth, Earl of Clarendon). Portland Avenue, Gladstone’s main street, is the only divergence from this naming convention. Named for the 1893 <b>Interurban</b> Electric Streetcar line that once traversed the street, it once transported passengers to and from Gladstone to Portland.|$|E

5|$|The City of Norman was {{formally}} incorporated on , 1891. The city {{has continued to}} grow throughout the decades. By 1902 the downtown district contained two banks, two hotels, a flour mill, and other businesses; by 1913 there were over 3,700 residents living in Norman when the Oklahoma Railway Company decided to extend its <b>interurban</b> streetcar running from Oklahoma City to Moore into Norman, spurring additional population growth. The rail lines eventually transitioned to freight during the 1940s as the United States Numbered Highway system developed. The city population reached 11,429 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of Old Louisville by the wealthy was {{a reflection of}} changing lifestyles brought on by technology. Many homes of Old Louisville were originally built as mansions that would require several servants to maintain. Because of the relatively high wages offered by manufacturing jobs, servants were no longer affordable to all but the wealthiest families by the mid-20th century. <b>Interurban</b> rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that the wealthy {{no longer had to}} live so close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county's east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{new road}} also led {{indirectly}} to {{the downfall of}} the area's public transportation system. Between 1925 and 1932, the Texas <b>Interurban</b> Railway, an electric commuter rail service that ran from Dallas to Denton, operated a station in Lewisville. Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time, proudly citing the city's progressive citizenship. The area's low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line went out of business and immediately halted service.|$|E
50|$|The {{effort was}} not {{successful}} {{and the new}} company failed in 1915 and was dissolved into its individual component <b>interurbans</b> in 1916.|$|R

5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric <b>interurban</b> line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the railroad. It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert the railroad to , electrify it to make it an <b>interurban,</b> and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad) at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over the railroad about 1916. They converted the railroad to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah <b>interurban</b> {{streetcar}} line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
