25|$|The GT5 Time Trial Demo was {{released}} on December 17, 2009 on the PlayStation Network; it was only playable while the user was signed into the PlayStation Network. It {{was not so much}} a demo of GT5 itself, but actually {{the first part of the}} 2010 GT Academy, with the fastest drivers from the time trial eventually getting the chance to drive a real racing car in a real racing series. Nevertheless, it showed what progress had been made since Polyphony Digital's latest game, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in terms of graphics, physics and other aspects of gameplay and design. It featured stock and tuned versions of the Nissan 370Z. The track featured in the demo was the Indianapolis GP circuit, which <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Gran Turismo series. This demo was praised for its graphics and updated physics, however it has been criticised for its stiff camera, and confusion over what aspects of the final game the demo represents. The Time Trial demo is no longer playable now that the 2010 GT Academy is complete.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent {{that he wanted to}} conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, [...] "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible– but by now it has vanished." [...] He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." [...] The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.|$|E

2500|$|The {{composition}} of breast milk changes {{depending on how}} long the baby nurses at each session, {{as well as on}} the child's age. The first type, produced during the first days after childbirth, is called colostrum. [...] Colostrum is easy to digest although it is more concentrated than mature milk. [...] It has a laxative effect that helps the infant to pass early stools, aiding in the excretion of excess bilirubin, which helps to prevent jaundice. It also helps to seal the infants gastrointestional tract from foreign substances, which may sensitize the baby to foods that the mother has eaten. Although the baby has received some antibodies through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA).

[...] He alluded to the limits of human experience, expressing: [...] "all that we see in a miracle is an effect which <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> our observation, and whose cause is concealed. The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation, and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature; but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature.

2500|$|F-Zero Climax is {{a racing}} game that plays {{similarly}} to its immediate predecessor (...) {{and the original}} F-Zero game. Players select their vehicles and race around fifty-three courses while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs. Each racing craft contains air brakes for drifting around tight corners by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons. A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an energy meter. Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used {{in tandem with the}} energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost. Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy. Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the 2D F-Zero series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost to inflict extra damage. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations.|$|E

Up to four players can be supported online with four different types of game, as well as perks and rank-ups. Compared to Modern Warfare, it has improved in-level geometry, has more responsive sprints and crouches and 3D-modeled guns instead of 2D sprites. However the flamethrower, which <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the game series, is rendered with 2D sprites. The framerate is just under 30 and has lots of voice-over during the missions. Players are able to defuse mines and send Morse code with the touch screen, as well as using mortar rounds, an anti-air gun from a battleship, parachuting and using mounted guns. There is also a tank mode which allows the player to turn the main gun and fire machine gun rounds at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|In Nature and Human Nature (Houghton Mifflin, 1892), [...] "Emerson {{treats the}} efforts {{that men have}} made to {{interpret}} the world through art. She discusses first the ideals in men's minds, then the various forms {{in which they have}} sought to embody these, – in music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. A specially interesting interpretation is given of landscape painting and Gothic architecture, with reference to the spiritual qualities which give significance to pictures and buildings. The Dial was less complimentary in its review of Nature and Human Nature stating: A desire to cover too large a field is apparent in Mrs. Ellen Russell Emerson’s “Nature and Human Nature” (Houghton). Literature, language, and art, including music, also come in for discussion. In her treatment of art, and symbolism in art, the author shows herself most at home, despite an occasional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy. Her interpretation of the Laocoön as suggesting, in the serpents’ undulating folds, “the gliding stanchless waves of the sea, against whose onward movement there is no barrier,” <b>is</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> us. Were Poseidon the offended divinity in the case, this reading of the symbol would be more plausible. But the temptation to subtilize on art, as Lessing says in his “Laokoon,” sometimes leads one into whimsical theories. As an interpreter of nature, Mrs. Emerson is helpful. Passing to letters, she asserts that when a poet willingly becomes a translator of another's verse, he thereby stands confessed as a minor poet. Hence she refuses to recognize Longfellow and Bryant as great poets. Leaving Pope out of the account, does she forget that Goethe and Schiller and Browning also tried their hand at translating ? Or would she deny greatness to them as well? Evidently not; for she afterwards speaks of Browning in the same breath with Shakespeare, ascribing to both the “balance of heart and brain.” that marks the true poet. The writer's thought, it must be said in conclusion, suffers for lack of terseness and incisiveness in its presentation. We choose, almost at random, a sentence that cries out for the pruning-knife, – “Interpretation of the sublimity of an uplift of rock, forest, and tableland is product of a vision dependent on the soul's sight, and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous scenery than is color to a garden of flowers.” The Gallicism in the following is so harsh, and so unnecessary, as to merit censure, – “Scientific discovery, indeed, has laid its axe to the root of many errors, and among which the error of self-importance is not the least conspicuous.” May linguistic discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error of speech ! A number of new or little-used words, as “sculptuary” (i.g. sculpture), “bolide,” “landscapist,” are encountered in Mrs. Emerson's pleasant pages." ...|$|E
