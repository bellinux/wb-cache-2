25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing.

50|$|The {{objective}} of <b>degermination</b> in corn dry milling {{is to break}} down kernel to pericarp, endosperm and germ. Beall operation is used for fulfilling this goal which separates the kernels received form tempering section into tails and throughs. Beall degerminator {{is known for its}} high yield of flaking grits; however, other manufactures have lower power requirement. Pilot plant Beall has an inner cone rotating at 800 rpm. One of the advantages of Beall <b>degermination</b> is weight adjustment at tailgate for increment the residence time by holding back the material.|$|E
50|$|The most {{utilized}} grinding mills include pin, hammer, and disk mills, {{but many}} machines are utilized for more specific processes. To maintain a high starch extraction, the grains {{will go through}} a <b>degermination</b> process. This process removes the germ and fiber (pericarp) first, and the endosperm is recovered in several sizes: grits, cones, meal, and flow. It {{is important to note}} that the gluten protein matrix is not separated from the starch.|$|E

In all phases of micro-malting isolation and determination of Fusarium spp. were performed. It was established that barley samples, before malting, were contaminated with zearalenone (barley sample 1 - 9. 7 μg/kg, barley sample 2 - 9. 2 μg/kg). The following Fusarium spp. were isolated: F. avenaceoum, F. culmorum, F. poae F. sporotrichioides, F. tricinctum and F. verticillioides. In both barley samples zearalenone content increased during steeping (86. 5 μg/kg and 37. 4 μg/kg), decreased during germination (12. 5 μg/kg and 26. 8 μg/kg), and increased after kilning (62. 9 μg/kg and 71. 2 μg/kg).

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} on {{fineness}} of corn flour particle size by addition of papain enzyme and study the phenomenon of papain enzyme addition for the difference effects to their hardness, morphology and pasting properties. Hardness measurement and protein content analysis results of the two varieties of corn grits resulted from <b>degermination</b> show that incubation with papain on corn grits reduced grit hardness and protein content. Grit hardness reduction is due to protein matrix degradation that covers starch granular of horny endosperm. It is identified that local corn grit reduction difference is bigger than that of hybrid corn grits. Observation on morphology grits shows that there are difference in incubation effect with papain on both variety corn grits. First, local corn horny endosperm starch granular size is smaller and more homogeneous (3 - 7 µm) than that of hybrid corn (3 - 12 µm). Second, local corn horny endosperm granular shape is spherical while hybrid corn’s is dominantly polygonal. The association shows that hardness difference on local corn and hybrid corn does not affect directly to corn flour amylograph characteristics produced...|$|E
40|$|O milho é uma das principais matérias-primas para a indústria de alimentos. Desse cereal, é possível obter óleo, fubá, canjica, grits, farelo, amido e zeína. Conduziu-se este trabalho com o objetivo de avaliar o rendimento de moagem a seco, produção de grits e composição química de 16 {{cultivar}}es de milho. Os grãos de milho das 16 cultivares avaliadas tiveram a sua umidade padronizada para 12 % e foram submetidos a um processo de limpeza em uma mesa gravimétrica. Encerrada a etapa de limpeza, foram colocados 10 kg de grãos de cada cultivar em degerminador de facas com rotação de 600 rpm por um período de 10 minutos. Após a degerminação, o endosperma foi passado por moinho de rolos corrugados com distância entre rolos de 30 mm. O material moído foi submetido à tamisação em peneiras de 14, 20, 25 e 30 mesh por um período de 10 minutos. Para a degerminação, o delineamento experimental utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, com um fator de 16 cultivares e 2 repetições. Na tamisação, o delineamento usado foi com dois fatores: 16 cultivares, 5 peneiras e 2 repetições.

From the maize grain it is possible to get oil, meal, grits, bran, starch, zein. The objectives of this research was to evaluate the dry-miling yield and chemical composition of different experimental maize genotypes. Fourteen genotypes came from the breeding program of Embrapa Corn and Sorghum Researcher Center and two came from commercial companies. The grain moisture content of all cultivars were equilibrated at 12 % and dust was removed in a gravimetric board, before processing. Grain samples of each type was placed in a blade degermer at 600 rpm rotation speed for 10 minutes. The endosperm portion, after <b>degermination,</b> was transferred to a mill roll. Following the milling process grounded material was sifted in 14, 20, 25 and 30 mesh sifters for 10 minutes.

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of pellagra {{in the first}} half of this century at its peak produced at least 250, 000 cases and caused 7, 000 deaths a year for several decades in 15 southern states. It also filled hospital wards in other states, which had a similar incidence but refused to report their cases. Political influences interfered, not only with surveillance of the disease, but also in its study, recognition of its cause, and the institution of preventive measures when they became known. Politicians and the general public felt that it was more acceptable for pellagra to be infectious than for it to be a form of malnutrition, a result of poverty and thus an embarrassing social problem. Retrospectively, a change in the method of milling cornmeal, <b>degermination,</b> which began shortly after 1900, probably accounted for the appearance of the epidemic; such a process was suggested at the time, but the suggestion was ignored. The story of the {{epidemic of}} pellagra in the United States, which occurred {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century, may remind people of contemporary events surrounding the AIDS epidemic, when social and political forces have affected medical research. To a very real extent, history has been repeating itself. The epidemic of pellagra, which caused over 3 million cases and 100, 000 deaths in th...|$|E
40|$|The germ {{fraction}} with maize pericarp (GMP), {{obtained from}} the <b>degermination</b> of this cereal, presents a high nutrient density,  however, it is underused as food. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to develop cookies enriched with GMP, in order to evaluate their acceptability and determine their centesimal composition. The GMP fraction was added to the formulations, in the proportion of 40 % and 50 %, in replacement of wheat flour and cassava starch. Centesimal composition analyses were performed for both the GMP fraction and cookies. All cookies were accepted, in relation to global acceptance, however, only the cookie with 40 % replacement of wheat flour and cassava starch by GMP was accepted, concerning appearance. The GMP fraction showed high levels of lipids (18 %) and total dietary fiber (29 %), and considerable protein content (12 %). Significant differences were observed in the protein content of the cookie with 50 % replacement of wheat flour and cassava starch by GMP (7. 76 g 100 g- 1), in relation to the control and the cookie with 40 % replacement (6. 76 g 100 g- 1 and 6. 88 g 100 g- 1, respectively). The GMP fraction increased the dietary fiber content, did not change the lipids concentration, and reduced the energy value of cookies. The use of germ fraction with maize pericarp in food products allows the increase of their dietary fiber content and the decrease of their energy value.  KEY-WORDS: Maize germ; cookie; chemical composition; nutritional value; acceptability. A fração gérmen com pericarpo de milho (GPM), obtida por meio da de germinação deste cereal, possui alta densidade de nutrientes, contudo, ainda é subutilizada na alimentação humana. Portanto, este trabalho teve como objetivos desenvolver biscoitos tipo cookie, enriquecidos com GPM, avaliar a aceitabilidade e determinar sua composição centesimal. A fração GPM foi acrescentada às formulações, na proporção de 40 % e 50 %, em substituição à farinha de trigo e fécula de mandioca. Foram realizadas análises de composição centesimal da fração GPM e dos biscoitos. Todos os biscoitos foram aceitos, em relação à aceitação global, porém, apenas o biscoito com 40 % de substituição de farinha de trigo e fécula de mandioca por GPM foi aceito, em relação à aparência. Na fração GPM, constataram-se altos teores de lipídios (18 %) e de fibra alimentar total (29 %), e conteúdo considerável de proteína (12 %). Foram observadas diferenças significativas no teor de proteínas do biscoito com 50 % de substituição de farinha de trigo e fécula de mandioca por GPM (7, 76 g 100 g- 1 ), em relação ao controle e àquele com 40 % de substituição (6, 76 g 100 g- 1 e 6, 88 g 100 g- 1, respectivamente). A fração GPM aumentou o teor de fibra alimentar, não interferiu na concentração de lipídios e reduziu o valor energético dos biscoitos. O emprego da fração gérmen com pericarpo de milho, em produtos alimentícios, possibilita aumento do teor de fibra alimentar e redução do valor energético dos produtos.
