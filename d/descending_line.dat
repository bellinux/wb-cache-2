500|$|Cole's recording, {{which took}} place on August 22, 1947, {{featured}} an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol—the in-house arranger of Capitol Records. He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song, to capture the [...] "enchanting" [...] vibe of the track. The first two measures of the song's melody parallel the melody of the second movement in composer Antonín Dvořák's Piano Quintet No. 2 (1887). Written as a pop ballad, [...] "Nature Boy" [...] follows an [...] "A,B" [...] format, with the primary three notes descending on a minor triad above the pickup note. An ascending line over the diminished ii chord returns to the initial minor triad. The harmonic structure makes frequent use of the standard ii–V–I progression in the key of D minor. The second 4-bar section featured a chromatic <b>descending</b> <b>line</b> based on the lowering of the tonic (Dm–Dmmaj7–Dm7–Dm6). The same <b>descending</b> <b>line</b> then continues through Gm6–Dm, then finally ending with a whole-step down to the G in the chord Em75.|$|E

500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a <b>descending</b> <b>line</b> brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The quoted {{fragments}} {{are often}} chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo.

This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from Johannes Brahms' violin concerto [...] The text from Beckett at this point begins, [...] "So {{after a period of}} immaculate silence there seemed", but, instead of continuing the quotation ("a feeble cry was heard by me"), Berio substitutes the words [...] "to be a violin concerto being played in the other room in three quarters" [...] and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on [...] "two violin concertos", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms [...]|$|E

[...] "It cannot be done tonight," [...] said Mr. Valeer. [...] "I bear the clang of death; my {{strength}} and armor shall prevail. My Ambulinia shall rest in this hall until the break of another day, and if we fall, we fall together. If we die, we die clinging to our tattered rights, and our blood alone shall tell the mournful tale of a murdered daughter and a ruined father." [...] Sure enough, he kept watch all night, and was successful in defending his house and family. The bright morning gleamed upon the hills, night vanished away, the Major and his associates felt somewhat ashamed that they had not been as fortunate as they expected to have been; however, they still leaned upon their arms in dispersed groups; some were walking the streets, others were talking in the Major's behalf. Many of the citizen suspended business, as the town presented nothing but consternation. A novelty that might end in the destruction of some worthy and respectable citizens. Mr. Valeer ventured in the streets, though not without being well armed. Some of his friends congratulated him on the decided stand he had taken, and hoped he would settle the matter amicably with Elfonzo, without any serious injury. [...] "Me," [...] he replied, [...] "what, me, condescend to fellowship with a coward, and a low-lived, lazy, undermining villain? no, gentlemen, this cannot be; I had rather be borne off, like the bubble upon the dark blue ocean, with Ambulinia by my side, than to have him in the ascending or <b>descending</b> <b>line</b> of relationship. Gentlemen," [...] continued he, [...] "if Elfonzo is so much of a distinguished character, and is so learned in the fine arts, why do you not patronize such men? why not introduce him into your families, as a gentleman of taste and of unequaled magnanimity? why are you so very anxious that he should become a relative of mine? Oh, gentlemen, I fear you yet are tainted with the curiosity of our first parents, who were beguiled by the poisonous kiss of an old ugly serpent, and who, for one APPLE, DAMNED all mankind. I wish to divest myself, as far as possible, of that untutored custom. I have long since learned that the perfection of wisdom, and the end of true philosophy, is to proportion our wants to our possessions, our ambition to our capacities; we will then be a happy and a virtuous people." [...] Ambulinia was sent off to prepare for a long and tedious journey. Her new acquaintances had been instructed by her father how to treat her, and in what manner, and to keep the anticipated visit entirely secret. Elfonzo was watching the movements of everybody; some friends had told him of the plot that was laid to carry off Ambulinia. At night, he rallied some two or three of his forces, and went silently along to the stately mansion; a faint and glimmering light showed through the windows; lightly he steps to the door; there were many voices rallying fresh in fancy's eye; he tapped the shutter; it was opened instantly, and he beheld once more, seated beside several ladies, the hope of all his toils; he rushed toward her, she rose from her seat, rejoicing; he made one mighty grasp, when Ambulinia exclaimed, [...] "Huzza for Major Elfonzo! I will defend myself and you, too, with this conquering instrument I hold in my hand; huzza, I say, I now invoke time's broad wing to shed around us some dewdrops of verdant spring." ...|$|E

50|$|William Mitchell, from a Schenkerian perspective, {{does not}} see the G as an appoggiatura because the melodic line (oboe: G-A-A-B) ascends to B, making the A a passing note.
