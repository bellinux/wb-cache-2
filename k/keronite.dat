40|$|This paper {{shall present}} a survey on a vacuum or space related effect, which is {{referred}} to as “cold welding”, “adhesion ” or “sticking”. It refers to “welding or sticking ” of contacting bodies which shall open vertically (no sliding), i. e. acc. to ECSS “separable contact surfaces”. Starting from a reported failure on a spacecraft, test facilities were developed and a verification study was done to show relevance between the test results and the reported failure. In the following, a standardised test method was set-up, in order to compare different space relevant materials and coatings for their tendency to cold welding. Within several studies, common experience and numerical results were gained on space relevant combinations of materials and coatings. Based on this knowledge, recommendations for use of certain combinations will be drawn. Adhesion forces under fretting were found to exceed the loading forces. As example, nickel containing stainless steels shall be avoided. An assessment of coatings for steels and Aluminium (e. g. hard anodising, <b>Keronite)</b> is given. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} current knowledge of PEO coating characteristics and properties is made, and several areas requiring more accurate or more detailed investigations are identified. A leading commercial product – the <b>Keronite</b> TM coating for aluminium alloys – is the used {{as a basis for}} the investigation of the microstructure and properties of PEO coatings. Coating structure and morphology are studied quantitatively to investigate their growth mechanism. Composition is accurately determined for the first time, allowing predictions of physical, mechanical and thermal properties to be made. Particular attention is also paid to the presence of amorphous material and fine-scale porosity – properties which had previously been neglected. The latter is critical to the understanding of coating formation and the capacity for coating impregnation, and is measured and characterised using numerous porosimetry techniques. Mechanical properties of the coatings are characterised using indentation and macroscopic techniques such as beam bending. Correlations are established between the observed structure and measured physical properties such as hardness, local modulus and global stiffness. It is found that wear resistance can also be explained {{on the basis of the}} measured mechanical properties and structure. The discovery of low coating stiffness means that high-temperature applications, which had previously been dismissed on the basis of thermal expansion mismatch between the coating and substrate, may indeed be possible. The thermal stability of the coatings is therefore investigated and their stability up to 800 °C is demonstrated. Residual stresses are measured and explained in terms of the postulated coating growth mechanism. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|As {{it becomes}} more {{important}} to replace fossil fuels with alternative fuels, biofuels like ethanol are becoming more commercially used. The increased use of ethanol brings good influences such as lower impact on the environment. However, the use of ethanol can also bring negative effects regarding corrosion of metals. In the automotive industry aluminium has been seen affected by a novel very aggressive corrosion phenomenon, alcoholate corrosion. This master thesis investigation has investigated {{the effect of a}} few parameters of importance for alcoholate corrosion; water, temperature, time and pressure. The aluminium alloys AA 6063 and A 380 have been investigated and the capacity of five different surface treatments of AA 6063 has been tested to observe if they inhibit the effect of alcoholate corrosion.   Throughout the experiments the water dependence of alcoholate corrosion has showed to be of large importance for the corrosion process. An increase in water content will postpone the start of alcoholate corrosion or prevent corrosion to occur.   A correlation between temperature and time has been observed. Higher temperatures results in a shorter time period of exposure before alcoholate corrosion occurs, and vice versa. The effect of different pressures was investigated and showed no effect on alcoholate corrosion when using pressurisation with the inert nitrogen gas.   All surface treatments revealed a capacity to protect the aluminium alloy against alcoholate corrosion to different extent. The electroless nickel plating seemed to prevent alcoholate corrosion while the <b>Keronite</b> coating seemed more sensitive to this form of corrosion...|$|E
