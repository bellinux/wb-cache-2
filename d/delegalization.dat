50|$|Apothecaries' {{measures}} are fully {{described in the}} Weights and Measures Act of 1878. In the United Kingdom, the 1963 Weights and Measures Act provided for {{the abolition of the}} minim, fluid scruple, and fluid drachm, all already obsolete. Actual <b>delegalization</b> occurred on 1 February 1971.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the ancient}} Romans, {{the month of}} June was {{particularly}} auspicious, due to its affiliation with the goddess Juno; it was supposedly derived and sacred to {{the queen of the}} gods. A full or new moon were lucky during this month, especially. As many cultures agree, the Romans believed May to be an unfavorable and even illegal month to marry because it was during this month that the festival of Bona Dea, the goddess of charity, took place. The Feasts of the Dead, also named lemuralia, where specters called lemures, or larvœ haunted the living, particularly the young. Their affinity towards tormenting weddings caused the <b>delegalization</b> of marriage during that time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Delegalization</b> of {{arms control}} is now an {{accomplished}} fact. In this period of potential dramatic revision of the international order, {{it is not surprising}} that the US is seeking increased flexibility in pursuing several strategies, including the full use of military and technological advantages. The motivations behind this include US interests, as well as long run global interests. What may be surprising, however, is the potential risk to our democratic processes from <b>delegalization</b> {{of arms control}}-that is to say, the danger posed by reduced use of arms control treaties with built-in processes of transparency and democratic accountability. The potential risk is particularly apparent in those cases where arms control treaties function in effect as treaties of peace, alliance, or neutrality that arguably should be subject to the control of the constitutional treaty makers. Notwithstanding these concerns, this Article argues that on balance the constitutional text, structure, and history compel the conclusion that the democracy deficit risked by <b>delegalization</b> of arms control is adequately attenuated through continuing congressional participation in the arms control process and, in any event, outweighed by the need for a vigorous executive to exercise the role it assumed at the very beginning of this Republic when 2 ̆ 2 regime change 2 ̆ 2 in Europe was also the question of the day...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{assumption}} that there is a continuum running from non-legal positions to legally binding and judicially controlled commitments with, in between these two opposite types of norms, commitments that can be described as soft law. It aims at defining soft law in international relations in order to provide a mapping of EU law on the basis of the soft law / hard law divide. It helps categorize EU competences and public policies, and see how they fit with the distinction between two kinds of processes: legalization (transformation of non-legal norms into soft or hard law) and <b>delegalization</b> (transformation of hard law norms into soft law and evolution from hard to soft law) ...|$|E
40|$|Social and {{economic}} societal values {{are incorporated into}} the Canadian legal system, and widespread questioning of these values adds uncertainty to the future role of that system. In order {{to address the question}} of whether the law will still be seen as a force for orderly social change in the future, this article first canvasses the overall demand for legal services in Canada. It considers the possibility of deprofessionalization and <b>delegalization</b> but predicts that, instead, demand will likely increase, meaning lawyers will be used in greater numbers than ever before and in broader areas of human development including the social, political {{and economic}} spheres. The second part of the article reviews specific areas of law where expansion will most likely occur, emphasizing changes to legal education...|$|E
40|$|The {{juridification}} {{of social}} spheres {{appears as a}} disquieting modern trend in several different national cultures. Although the large variety of national experiences with juridification cannot be summarized in a unifying formula, {{it is important to}} note that juridification is not to be understood primarily as a quantitative phenomenon of the growth of law and regulation. Rather, it has to be seen in its qualitative dimensions, that is, as the emergence of new structures of law to keep pace with the growth of the welfare state. To the degree that the law is used for the regulatory and compensatory purposes of the welfare state, extensive changes in the structure and function of law are involved. In addition, recent trends of crisis in regulatory law seem to be closely connected to the more general crisis of the welfare state. One fascinating aspect of the debate on the crisis of the welfare state and the law is the emergence not only of the concepts of <b>delegalization</b> and deregulation but also of alternatives to <b>delegalization,</b> that is, of forms of legal discourse which avoid certain fallacies of regulatory law without abandoning the idea of an active role of law in shaping social institutions. The modern phenomenon of juridification was the central theme of a larger research project which Terence Daintith and I conducted at the European University Institute in Florence. The results of this project were presented in March 1985 at a conference on "Law and Economic Policy: Alternatives to De-Legalization". The contributions with an economic policy orientation are to be published separately in a volume on "Law as an Instrument of Economic Policy" edited by Terence Daintith; this volume instead concentrates on juridification in the fields of labor, industrial organization, antitrust and social security.

40|$|Arms {{control was}} never an end in itself. Arms control and nonproliferation policy always had as their goals {{increasing}} international security. It may be worth recalling that, in response to having it called to his attention that he had changed his views on a matter, Lord Keynes is widely reported to have quipped, 2 ̆ 2 When the facts change, what do you do? 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, as Lord Keynes also once said, 2 ̆ 2 There is no harm in sometimes being wrong-especially if one is promptly found out. 2 ̆ 2 The question for this panel is whether the sea change in strategic thinking reflected in the arms control and nonproliferation policies of the Bush administration are based on new facts and {{a better understanding of}} the relation between those policies and the international environment. In keeping with the theme of this conference, we need to explore whether long-established or emerging understandings of the role international law plays in this area provide the best platform for assuring international security from the risk of weapons of mass destruction. Are arms control and nonproliferation in fact a case of <b>delegalization,</b> or are they simply the beginnings of a relegalization on entirely new premises...|$|E
