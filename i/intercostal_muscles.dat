5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
25|$|Efferent {{signals are}} the motor {{neuronal}} signals descending to the respiratory muscles. The most important respiratory muscle is the diaphragm.

25|$|If {{the hands}} are raised over the head, palms together, (as per the variation) this {{stretches}} the thoracic cavity and rib structures including the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> and expands the thoracic cavity increasing lung capacity. A slight back bend could be included {{to accentuate the}} effect and stretch {{the front of the}} body, chest and ribs more.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{the main}} muscle of respiration and functions in breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves in the inferior direction, enlarging {{the volume of the}} thoracic cavity and reducing intra-thoracic pressure (the external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> also participate in this enlargement), forcing the lungs to expand. In other words, the diaphragm's movement downwards creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity, which forces the lungs to expand to fill the void, drawing air in the process.|$|E
25|$|As the {{diaphragm}} contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> {{as shown in}} Fig.4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig.4); but the lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig.5). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased {{in the same way}} as the antero-posterior diameter is increase by the so-called pump handle movement shown in Fig.4.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThoracotomy is {{associated}} with significant pain and morbidity. MethodsWe performed a prospective randomized trial over 4 months. Patients were randomized to a standard posterior-lateral thoracotomy or an identical procedure, except an <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> was harvested from the lower rib (to protect the intercostal nerve) before chest retraction. To ensure an equal distribution among both groups, patients were stratified by race, sex, and type of pulmonary resection. All patients received similar pain management. Pain was assessed by using multiple pain scores during hospitalization and after discharge. Outcomes assessed were pain scores, spirometric values, analgesic use, and activity level. ResultsThere were 114 patients. The median time for <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> harvesting was 3. 7 minutes. The numeric pain scores were lower for the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> group on postoperative days 1 and 2 and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 (P <. 05 for all). In addition, patients in the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> group had a smaller decrease in spirometric values, {{were less likely to}} be using analgesics, and were more likely to have returned to normal activity. ConclusionsThe harvesting of an <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> flap before chest retraction decreases the pain of thoracotomy and leads to a lower decrease in spirometry. In addition, patients have less pain at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively and are less likely to be using narcotics. Finally, it offers a pedicled muscle flap that takes little time to harvest and is able to buttress all bronchi after lobectomy...|$|R
25|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} lungs is less complex in reptiles than in mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange in reptiles still occurs in alveoli however. Reptiles do not possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via {{a change in the}} volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inhalation and exhalation.|$|E
25|$|Difficulty in chewing and {{swallowing}} makes eating {{very difficult}} and {{increases the risk of}} choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Chest muscles. The breasts lie {{upon the}} pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> (between the ribs), and can extend to and cover {{a portion of}} the (front) {{anterior}} serratus muscle (attached to the ribs, the rib muscles, and the shoulder blade), and to the rectus abdominis muscle (a long, ﬂat muscle extending up the torso, from pubic bone to rib cage). The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic shear forces (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying supine), and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).|$|E

50|$|<b>Intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> {{activity}} {{decreases in}} REM sleep and contribution of rib cage to respiration decreases during REM sleep. This {{is due to}} REM related supraspinal inhibition of alpha motoneuron drive and specific depression of fusimotor function. Diaphraghmatic activity correspondingly increases during REM sleep. Although paradoxical thoracoabdominal movements are not observed, the thoracic and abdominal displacements are not exactly in phase. This decrease in <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity is primarily responsible for hypoventilation that occurs in patients with borderline pulmonary function.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of the turtle's shell is unique because of how the carapace represents transformed vertebrae and ribs. While other tetrapods have their scapula, or shoulder blades, found outside of the ribcage, the scapula for turtles is found inside the ribcage. The shells of other tetrapods, such as armadillos, are not linked directly to the vertebral column or rib cage allowing the ribs to move freely with the surrounding <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle.</b> However, analysis of the transitional fossil, Eunotosaurus africanus shows that early ancestors of turtles lost that <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> usually found between the ribs.|$|R
25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The <b>Intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E
500|$|The lungs of {{crocodilians}} {{are attached}} to the liver and the pelvis by the diaphragmaticus muscle (analogous of the diaphragm in mammals). During inhalation, the external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> expand the ribs, allowing the animal to take in more air, while the ischiopubis muscle causes the hips to swing downwards and push the belly outward, and the diaphragmaticus pulls the liver back. When exhaling, the internal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> push the ribs inward, while the rectus abdominis pulls the hips and liver forwards and the belly inward. Because the lungs expand into the space formerly occupied by the liver and are compressed when it moves back into position, this motion is sometimes referred to as a [...] "hepatic piston". Crocodilians can also use these muscles to adjust the position of their lungs; thereby controlling their buoyancy in the water. An animal sinks when the lungs are pulled towards the tail and floats when they move back towards the head. This allows them to move through the water without creating disturbances that could alert potential prey. In addition, they can also spin and twist by moving their lungs laterally.|$|E
500|$|The lungs are {{not capable}} of {{expanding}} themselves, and will only do so {{when there is an}} increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This is achieved by the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram. During breathing out, at rest, the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a resting position determined by their anatomical elasticity. At this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 litres.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal progressive {{neurodegenerative disease}} with no available therapy. Components of the {{innate immune system}} are activated in the spinal cord and central nervous system of ALS patients. Studies in the SOD 1 (G 93 A) mouse show deposition of C 1 q and C 3 /C 3 b at the motor end-plate before neurological symptoms are apparent, suggesting that complement activation precedes neurodegeneration in this model. To obtain {{a better understanding of}} the role of complement at the motor end-plates in human ALS pathology, we analyzed post-mortem tissue of ALS donors for complement activation and its regulators. METHODS: Post-mortem <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> biopsies were collected at autopsy from ALS (n = 11) and control (n = 6) donors. The samples were analyzed for C 1 q, membrane attack complex (MAC), CD 55, and CD 59 on the motor end-plates, using immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Here, we show that complement activation products and regulators are deposited on the motor end-plates of ALS patients. C 1 q co-localized with neurofilament in the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> of ALS donors and was absent in controls (P = 0. 001). In addition, C 1 q was found deposited on the motor end-plates in the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle.</b> MAC was also found deposited on motor end-plates that were innervated by nerves in the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> of ALS donors but not in controls (P = 0. 001). High levels of the regulators CD 55 and CD 59 were detected at the motor end-plates of ALS donors but not in controls, suggesting an attempt to counteract complement activation and prevent MAC deposition on the end-plates before they are lost. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that complement activation products are deposited on innervated motor end-plates in the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> of ALS donors, indicating that complement activation may precede end-plate denervation in human ALS. This study adds to the understanding of ALS pathology in man and identifies complement as a potential modifier of the disease process...|$|R

2500|$|When the {{diaphragm}} relaxes, air is exhaled by elastic recoil process [...] of the lung and the tissues lining the thoracic cavity.
