40|$|This paper {{develops}} two indices, {{both local}} and global, to measure interregional redistribution. The local indices proposed involve a comparison between federal revenues and expenditures assigned to various regions and the pattern of income disparities among regions. They are developed by relating these comparisons under a given regional distribution of federal fiscal activity to three special cases under known degrees of redistribution, namely, (a) no redistribution, and (b) the degree of redistribution that would be delivered solely through equal per capita federal spending <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>region,</b> and (c) the maximum degree of redistribution that would equalize per capita income in all regions. Global indices are then developed as weighted averages of the local indices. A major benefit of the proposed indices is the direct measurement of how much interregional redistribution is generated by the federal fisc compared to these known degrees of redistribution. We calculate the proposed indices using Canadian data for 1996. Our {{results show that the}} federal fiscal system in 1996 delivered a degree of interregional redistribution 1. 8 times what would have been generated under equal per capita federal <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>region</b> and nearly half of the maximum redistribution that could have been delivered by the federal fisc...|$|R
40|$|In 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) began {{a series}} of marine angler <b>expenditure</b> surveys <b>in</b> the coastal regions of the United States (U. S.) to {{evaluate}} marine recreational fishing expenditures and the financial impacts of these <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>region</b> and the U. S. as a whole. In this report, we use the previously estimated expenditure estimates to assess the total financial impact of anglers’ saltwater expenditures. Estimates are provided for sales, income, employment, and tax impacts for <b>each</b> coastal state <b>in</b> the U. S. Aggregate estimates are also provided for the entire U. S., excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and Texas. Direct, indirect, and induced effects associated with resident and non-resident angler expenditures were estimated using a regional input-output modeling system called IMPLAN Pro. Nationwide, recreational saltwater fishing generated over 30. 5 billion in sales in 2000, nearly 12. 0 billion in income, and supported nearly 350, 000 jobs. Approximately 89 cents of every dollar spent by saltwater anglers was estimated to remain within the U. S. economy. At the state level, many of the goods anglers purchased were imports, and, as such, as little as 44 cents of every dollar stayed in Rhode Island and as much as 80 cents of every dollar stayed in Georgia. In the Northeast, the highest impacts were generated in New Jersey, even though recreational fishing <b>expenditures</b> <b>in</b> Massachusetts and Maryland were considerably higher. In the Southeast, the highest impacts were generated in Florida, and on the Pacific Coast, the highest impacts were generated <b>in</b> California. <b>Expenditures</b> on boat maintenance/expenses generated more impacts than any other <b>expenditure</b> category <b>in</b> the U. S. Expenditures on rods and reels was the single most important expense category in terms of generating impacts in most of the Northeast states. Expenditures on boat expenses generated the highest in most Southeast states, and expenditures for boat accessories produced the highest impacts in most Pacific Coast states.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the influence of scale and location on the multiplier values associated with tourism <b>expenditure</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b> of the <b>regions</b> of Indonesia. Furthermore, various factors are examined that determine the economic impacts of tourism to better understand how scale of accommodation and location {{can be used as a}} conceptual framework to help comprehend the patterns and interactions across regions. These concepts may be used to reveal the complexities underlying the fundamental structures in developing countries to show to what extent development facilitates tourism, and to what extent tourism encourages development. The specific objectives of the research are as follows: 1. To examine the effects of scale of accommodation on the multiplier values within the framework of similarities and differences in the levels of development, density and accessibility in the regions. The results can be used to identify the factors that influence the economic impact of tourism. This perspective examines tourism not only as a source of demand but also the simultaneous relationship between supply and demand within the intersectoral linkages of the national-regional Indonesian economic structure. 2. To examine the locational effects on the characteristics of multiplier values associated with tourism within the core-periphery relationship of the 27 regions of Indonesia. The study analyses the different locations of these regions as tourism destinations and compares how they act as a mediating absorption force for tourism's contribution to regional development. ii 3. To determine the characteristics of the economic impact of tourism in order to aid regional development planning with a better understanding of the concept of intersectoral and interspatial systems by treating tourism in a holistic manner and putting it in a broader context. Tourism, similar to other export industries, involves intersectoral activities, which is based on the recognition that the various sectors that make up the structure of the economy are interdependent. What makes tourism a unique phenomenon compared to other consumer-production relationships is that tourists must travel to the location of the destination in order to consume its product. It is this essential characteristic of tourism that ensures that it has a simultaneous effect not only on economic but also social, environmental and cultural structures in the region concerned. However, the impacts on environment and socio-cultural matters are outside the scope of the thesis. Due to these complex realities, tourism in developing countries can not be approached only in terms of master planning or marketing, rather it is fundamentally a problem of development. The main findings of this research indicate that <b>each</b> <b>region</b> has its own regional differentiation and unique characteristics. These differences involve location or accessibility, proximity to the centres of economic activities, regional economic structures, type and characteristics of tourist activities, and spending patterns. These findings seem to confirm the combined input/output and deductive gravity principles whereby the effects of interlinkages and interspatial factors are strongly intertwined in determining multiplier values of tourism across regions. iii In brief, the less developed the regions, and the farther the accessibility from the centre, the smaller the resulting multiplier values. There is a concept of 'absorption' involved in these relationships, in that multiplier values are gradually absorbed in proportion to flow per unit of economic distance. This evidence suggests that tourism in Indonesia is strongly related not only to development disparities but also to locational constraints. It is hoped that these findings, which offer an understanding of the contribution of scale and location in tourism and regional development, may help address national and regional tourism development policy-making and strategies in developing countries...|$|R
