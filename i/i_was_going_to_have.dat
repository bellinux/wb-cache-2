The song was co-written by Reddy with Ray Burton; Reddy has attributed {{the impetus for}} writing [...] "I Am Woman" [...] and her early awareness of the women's movement to expatriate Australian rock critic and pioneer feminist Lillian Roxon. Reddy is quoted in Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits as saying that {{she was looking for}} songs to record which reflected the positive self-image she had gained from joining the women's movement, but could not find any, so [...] "I realized that the song I was looking for didn't exist, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to write it myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, Bolland {{attended}} the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met [...] "a {{lot of the}} people who were key in the comics scene of the time," [...] including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to do the same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that." [...] Even so, he [...] "was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished," [...] and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his [...] "Norwich School of Art days," [...] Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.|$|E
