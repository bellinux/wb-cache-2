5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works {{were in some}} sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} said that Paul is not really Pauline in his eschatological {{thoughts}} in 2 Corinthians 4 : 7 - 5 : 10. What could be the reasonfor that? The discourse is very personal.
