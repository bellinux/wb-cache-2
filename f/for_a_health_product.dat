40|$|Short-run, {{targeted}} {{subsidies for}} health products {{are common in}} poor countries. How do they a¤ect long-run adoption? Standard economic theory predicts that they may increase long-run adoption through experience and social learning e¤ects. Those e¤ects will be muted, however, if subsidized products are unused or misused. Subsidies have also been argued to generate “entitlement e¤ects”: people may refuse to pay for products that were once free. A …eld experiment was designed to estimate {{the relative importance of}} these competing e¤ects.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} here recent {{modifications to}} the French Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) scheme for innovative medical devices. CED {{can be defined as}} temporary coverage <b>for</b> <b>a</b> novel <b>health</b> <b>product</b> during collection of the additional evidence required to determine whether definitive coverage is possible. The principle refinements to the scheme include a more precise definition of what may be considered an innovative product, the possibility for device manufacturers to request CED either independently or in partnership with hospitals, and the establishment of processing deadlines for health authorities. In the long term, these modifications may increase the number of applications to the CED scheme, which could lead to unsustainable funding for future projects. It will also be necessary to ensure that the study conditions required by national health authorities are suitable for medical devices and that processing deadlines are met for the scheme to be fully operational. Overall, the modifications recently applied to the French CED scheme for innovative medical devices should increase the transparency of the process, and therefore be more appealing to medical device manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Medical product firms {{often have}} limited {{channels}} of distribution {{due to the}} highly regulated {{environment in which they}} operate.   Creating <b>a</b> new channel <b>for</b> delivery of <b>a</b> <b>health</b> <b>product</b> is very difficult because it requires political action and requires strong arguments that there is unmet need for the product.   Determined leadership and action by the intermediaries involved and evidence that the product can be used safely in the new channel are also essential.   Pharmacists, vaccine manufacturers, and public health officials were able to open up <b>a</b> new channel <b>for</b> marketing vaccines by persistent effort over the past 15 years.   This paper describes this effort and illustrates the benefits for consumers, manufacturers, pharmacists, pharmacy chains, and the public <b>health</b> infrastructure.   <b>A</b> series of lessons learned is provided as guideposts for others to use in changing medical product distribution channels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare and {{well-being}} {{have captured the}} attention of established software companies, start-ups, and investors. Software is starting to play <b>a</b> central role <b>for</b> addressing the problems of the aging society and the escalating cost of healthcare services. Enablers of such digital <b>health</b> are <b>a</b> growing number of sensors for sensing the human body and communication infrastructure for remote meetings, data sharing, and messaging. The challenge that lies in front of us is how to effectively make use of these capabilities, for example to empower patients and to free the scarce resources of medical personnel. Requirements engineering is the process by which the capabilities of a software product are aligned with stakeholder needs and a shared understanding between the stakeholders and development team established. This book provides guide for what to look for and do when inquiring and specifying software that targets healthcare {{and well-being}}, helping readers avoid the pitfalls of the highly regulated and sensible healthcare domain are and how they can be overcome. This book brings together the knowledge of 22 researchers, engineers, lawyers, and CEOs that have experience in the development of digital health solutions. It represents a unique line-up of best practices and recommendations of how to engineer requirements for digital health. In particular the book presents: ·         The area of digital health, e-health, and m-health ·         Best practice for requirements engineering based on evidence from a large number of projects ·         Practical step-by-step guidelines, examples, and lessons-learned for working with laws, regulations, ethical issues, interoperability, user experience, security, and privacy ·         How to put these many concerns together for engineering the requirements of <b>a</b> digital <b>health</b> solution and <b>for</b> scaling <b>a</b> digital <b>health</b> <b>product</b> <b>For</b> anybody who intends to develop software for digital health, this book is an introduction and reference with a wealth of actionable insights. For students interested in understanding how to apply software to healthcare, the text introduces key topics and guides further studies with references to important literature...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) extraction (SFE) of targeted secondary metabolites from selected natural products. Phytochemical characterization and determination of biological efficacy was completed using advanced analytical methods and in-vivo bio-assays. More than 500 SFE extracts were generated and characterized. Sample preparation (particle size, moisture content) and extraction parameters (pressure, temperature and flow rate) were investigated {{and the ability of}} SFE to extract specific biosynthetic classes of compounds was evaluated. Where warranted, pilot scale studies were conducted for larger scale biological trials. SFE of the neotropical vine, Souroubea sympetala, a traditional medicine used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> culture bound syndrome related to anxiety, resulted in an extract rich in betulinic acid (5. 54 +/- 0. 24 mg/g) determined by HPLC-APCI/MS. When subjected to validated rodent anxiety behavioral assays (e. g. elevated plus maze (EPM)) the SFE extract demonstrated significant anxiolysis (anti-anxiety) compared to the vehicle control, with a 50 % increase in time spent in open arms and a 73 % increase in unprotected head dips observed. The significant in-vivo anxiolysis observed provides scientific support for the ethnobotanical use of this traditional medicine and <b>a</b> promising lead <b>for</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>health</b> <b>product</b> (NHP) to treat anxiety. Systematic variation of SFE parameters (pressure and temperature) on pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) oleoresin, a natural insecticide, resulted in a residue free pyrethrin concentrate, suitable for organic agricultural applications. The highest pyrethrin concentration (0. 531 g/g) and highest ratio of pyrethrins I (pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I) to pyrethrins II (pyrethrin II, cinerin II, jasmolin I) (PI:PII = 1. 95) was obtained at 40 °C; 10 MPa while 40 °C; 30 MPa produced the lowest pyrethrin concentration (0. 436 g/g) and lowest ratio of PI:PII (1. 87). Total pyrethrin recovery was highest at 40 °C; 30 MPa (8. 39 g pyrethrins) vs. 40 °C; 10 MPa (6. 96 g pyrethrins). The insecticidal activity of the SFE extracts of the pyrethrum oleoresin was confirmed (> 70 % mortality at 48 h) using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) a major pest of agriculture. SFE of piperamides from black pepper (Piper nigrum), a promising botanical insecticide and synergist, was successful at pressures above 30 MPa and temperatures greater than 50 ˙C with total yields greater than 7. 87 % (CV < 0. 10) and piperamide concentrations greater than 150 mg/g (CV < 6. 0). Flow rate, sample size, and particle size were optimized at 5 L/min, 10 g, and 1 mm mesh respectively. Insecticidal activity corroborated dose dependent piperamide bioactivity. Extract from 10 MPa; 60 °C (42. 38 mg/g) produced 10. 0 +/- 6. 8 (24 h) and 13. 3 +/- 6. 7 % (48 h) mortality. Extract from 35 MPa; 40 °C (148. 56 mg/g) produced 70. 0 +/- 10. 0 (24 h) and 73. 3 +/- 8. 4 % (48 h) mortality. Northern shrimp (Pandelus borealis) by-products extracted by SFE (35 MPa; 40 °C) generated a deep red oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (7. 8 +/- 0. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (8. 0 +/- 0. 07 %). Optimization of pressure (60 MPa), temperature (80 °C), moisture (13 %), particle size (0. 85 mm), and flow rate (9 L/min) resulted in a more efficient extraction without significantly changing concentrations of EPA and DHA. Pilot scale studies confirmed experimental data and supports further investigation of commercial production of an omega - 3 (o- 3) concentrate from Northern shrimp by-products...|$|R
