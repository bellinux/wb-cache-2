25|$|The {{training}} system {{is similar to}} the way the Basic Role-Playing system works.

60|$|For these reasons, no one {{ought to}} be allowed to suffer destitution so long as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is <b>willing</b> to work.

5000|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, a lord's or lady's honour was {{the group of}} manors <b>or</b> lands <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> held.

To make things worse, Lockhart claims that he knows that Anna is dead (which is not really true) which means Strasser has no way of blackmailing him.|$|R

25|$|Although 90% of HPV {{infections are}} cleared {{by the body}} within two years of infection, it is {{possible}} for infected cells to undergo a latency (quiet) period, with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later.

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice.
