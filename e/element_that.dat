5|$|Fermium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series. It is the heaviest <b>element</b> <b>that</b> can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last <b>element</b> <b>that</b> can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E

5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the <b>element</b> <b>that</b> undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

5|$|Bohrium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. It {{is named after}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is {{a synthetic}} element (an <b>element</b> <b>that</b> can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 270Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61seconds, though the unconfirmed 278Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690seconds.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive <b>element,</b> <b>that</b> can only be created in a laboratory.

Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.|$|E
5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new <b>element</b> <b>that</b> he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.|$|E

5|$|In Blockburger v.

The episode's first broadcast in the United States on May 16, 1991 gained a Nielsen rating of 12.4/21 and was negatively received by critics.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} <b>element</b> <b>that</b> is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E

5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the target value is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} <b>element</b> <b>that</b> is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E

Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen).|$|E

5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an <b>element</b> <b>that</b> is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
