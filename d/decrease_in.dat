5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the consumption of electricity and thus a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> respiratory rate and a marked <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} {{the possibility that}} the abnormal bone matrix produced during spaceflight may be associated with reduced expression of bone matrix protein genes. To test this possibility, we investigated the effects of a 14 -day spaceflight (SLS- 2 experiment) on steady-state mRNA levels for glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), osteocalcin, osteonectin, and prepro-alpha(1) subunit of type I collagen in the major bone compartments of rat femur. There were pronounced site-specific differences in the steady-state levels of expression of the mRNAs for the three bone matrix proteins and GAPDH in normal weight-bearing rats, and these relationships were altered after spaceflight. Specifically, spaceflight resulted <b>in</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> mRNA levels for GAPDH (<b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> proximal metaphysis), osteocalcin (<b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> proximal metaphysis), osteonectin (<b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> proximal and distal metaphysis), and collagen (<b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> proximal and distal metaphysis) compared with ground controls. There were no changes in mRNA levels for matrix proteins or GAPDH in the shaft and distal epiphysis. These results demonstrate that spaceflight leads to site- and gene-specific <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that spaceflight-induced <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> bone formation are caused by concomitant <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> expression of genes for bone matrix proteins...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{investigated}} whether {{weight loss}} decreases the waist-hip ratio (WHR) in overweight men and women, and whether change in WHR relates {{to change in}} cardiovascular risk factors, independent ofchange in weight. Weight loss correlated significantly with <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the circumference of the waist and hips, and <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> WHR in men and women. At com-parable levels of weight loss, men had greater <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the waist, and smaller <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the hips than women, resulting <b>in</b> greater <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> WHR. Cardiovascular risk factors im-proved significantly with weight loss. However, after controlling for weight loss, {{there was no evidence}} that change in WHR or change in circumference measures were related to change in risk factors. These data suggest that WHR is modifiable by weight loss, especially in men, but that change in WHR may not be independently related to changes in cardiovascular risk factors.
