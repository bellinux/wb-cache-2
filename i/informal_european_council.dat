5000|$|Deterioration {{of credit}} {{conditions}} during the Eurozone crisis, and specifically the contagion of financial instability to larger member {{states of the}} euro area {{from the middle of}} 2011, led to renewed thinking about the interdependence between banking policy, financial integration, and financial stability. On 17 April 2012, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde renewed the institution's earlier calls for banking policy integration by specifically referring to the need for the euro monetary union to be [...] "...supported by stronger financial integration which our analysis suggests be in the form of unified supervision, a single bank resolution authority with a common backstop, and a single deposit insurance fund." [...] The following week on 25 April 2012, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi echoed this call by noting in a speech before the European Parliament that [...] "Ensuring a well-functioning EMU implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at European level". Suggestions for more integrated European banking supervision were further discussed during an <b>informal</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> meeting on 23 May 2012, and appear to have been backed at the time by French President François Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. German Chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a degree of convergence on this agenda when declaring on 4 June 2012, that European leaders [...] "will also talk about to what extent we have to put systemically (important) banks under a specific European oversight".|$|E
40|$|The Single Market is {{a pillar}} of the European Union (EU) and has been {{essential}} in the last twenty-five years for the smooth functioning of Europe's economic and monetary policies. Besides, {{it is also the}} heart of a range of EU policies such as the Lisbon Strategy on growth and jobs. Despite these achievements, the Single Market still has untapped potential and needs to adapt to new realities. Subsequently, the European Commission set out its reviewed vision for the 21 st century Single Market providing a response to the challenges of globalisation. As part of this report, the Commission's services developed a new approach for a more systematic monitoring of the functioning of key goods and services markets, which was presented at the <b>informal</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> in October 2007. Within this context, this paper screens all the industries of the European economy to identify those key markets and sectors that are most important for growth and adjustment in the EU in terms of production, employment and income. It contributes to the literature by making a sensitivity analysis of the backward and forward impact indicators to identify the key sectors and eventually provides results for the EU as a whole and for individual countries for selected sectors: chemicals, fabrication of motor vehicles, food industry, construction work and pulp and paper industry.

40|$|In 2009 the European Union {{introduced}} the Lisbon Treaty. One {{of the changes}} this brought about was {{the introduction of a}} permanent president of the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> With this transformation the former EU presidency no longer exists and this thesis investigates the implications of this change. This is done by specifically looking at the national interests discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> Before the Lisbon Treaty Member States were able to influence the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> by pushing their national interests, but based on the new institutional settings of the permanent presidency, this seemed after Lisbon more unlikely. An analysis of nine rotating presidencies of the <b>Council</b> of the <b>European</b> Union after Lisbon has been made and compared to the respective <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> conclusions of that period. The results show that in fact national interests have been discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council.</b> Nevertheless, only a third of all national interests has been discussed. On the other hand, the analyses also reveal that on average the discussed national interests in the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> have significant similarity with the national interests of the Member States. Furthermore, the analysis brought also forward that certain national interests that seem not significant for the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> have been discussed in the <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> which could indicate that Member States can still push their national interests. In conclusion, national interests were discussed only to a low extent in the <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> answering the research question of this thesis: to what extent are national interests of Member States presiding over the <b>Council</b> of the <b>European</b> Union discussed during <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> meetings...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Council,</b> {{the meeting}} of the Heads of State and Government of the member states of the European Union, has evolved into EU's most {{influential}} and powerful decision-making institution. However, the process of deepening (expansion of policy areas) and widening (enlargement) of European integration have forced the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> to tackle the potential threat of a crisis in European top-level decision making before actual enlargement with ten new members in May 2004. If the current generation of political leaders is not able to reach agreement on necessary reforms, future decision-making in the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> could eventually {{turn out to be a}} mission impossible. Despite a successful record, the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> seemed to have lost its grip on the integration process, still based on an unchanged negotiation structure since its creation in the 1970 's, are needed if the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> wants to continue its important and guiding role in European integration. Two parallel processes of <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> reform have been initiated or intensified and are to be finalized before actual enlargement next year. The first process deals with the operational settings of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> summits. The second process deals with the institutional structure and the balance of power between the EU institutions. The main purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to present information on the evolution and current functioning of the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> since the summits are still surrounded by a lot of secrecy and informal decision-making. Secondly, an overview and analysis will be presented on these current reform processes that need to prepare the <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> for the upcoming enlargement.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main EU-level initiatives {{that have been}} put forward in the weeks following the attacks in Paris in January 2015, which {{will be discussed in}} the <b>informal</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> meeting of 12 February 2015. It argues that a majority of these proposals predated the Paris shootings and had until that point proved contentious as regards their efficacy, legitimacy and lawfulness. The paper finds that EU counterterrorism responses raise two fundamental challenges: A first challenge is posed to the freedom of movement, Schengen and EU citizenship. Priority is being given to the expanded use of large-scale surveillance and systematic monitoring of all travellers including EU citizens, which stands in contravention of Schengen and the free movement principle. A second challenge concerns EU democratic rule of law. Current pressures calling for the adoption of measures such as the EU Passenger Name Record challenge the scrutiny roles held by the European Parliament and the Court of Justice of the EU on counterterrorism measures in a post-Lisbon Treaty setting. The paper proposes that the EU adopts a new European Agenda on Security and Liberty based on an EU security (criminal justice-led) cooperation model that is firmly anchored in current EU legal principles and rule of law standards. This model would call for ‘less is more’ concerning the use, processing and retention of data by police and intelligence communities. Instead, it would pursue better and more accurate use of data meeting the quality standards of evidence in criminal judicial proceedings...|$|E
40|$|In late January 2000, the EU 14 {{initiated}} a protest co-ordinated by the Portuguese EU Presidency against the coalition between Wolfgang Schüssel’s ÖVP and Jörg Haider’s right-wing extremist/populist FPÖ, accused of violating EU fundamental values expressed in Article 6 (1) TEU. When the government took office on 4 February diplomatic ‘sanctions’ were launched. During spring, the EU 14 ’s wider {{interpretations of the}} sanctions, clumsy handling of Austrian countermeasures and deficient strategy on dismantling the protest contributed to crisis escalation. The solution was the appointment of so-called ‘wise men’ to evaluate the political nature of the FPÖ {{and the effects of}} the EU 14 ’s ‘diplomatic whipping’ on government policies. Shortly after the Wise Men Report was published the EU 14 lifted the ‘sanctions’ unconditionally, but insistent question marks remained. At the <b>informal</b> <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> meeting in Biarritz 13 - 14 October, the EU 14 and the Austrian government agreed on amendments to the trigger mechanisms for the ‘sanctions article’, Article 7 TEU, incorporated in the Nice Treaty from December 2000. This study argues that the EU 14 ’s interests and preferences concerning Article 6 (1) TEU, coupled with a consensus-reflex and imagined and ‘real’ time pressure manifested in groupthink and ‘tele groupthink’, a concept including telephone diplomacy, affected the norm during its ‘journey’ through five stages: warning, implementation, crisis escalation, crisis de-escalation, and consequences. A central claim is that both self-interested behaviour and ideational/normative motives guided the EU 14, but in a ‘more or less’ way. Mutually complementary arguments from both the rationalist and constructivist paradigms prove compelling in investigating this particularly complex and multi-faceted case. This study concludes that the EU 14 -Austria crisis resulted not in a rupture in the integration process, but in consolidation of EU fundamental values expressed in Article 6 (1) TEU. Thanks to mixed experiences with the EU 14 ’s ‘diplomatic whipping’ of the FPÖ-ÖVP government, the Union took another step towards tighter monitoring of Member States’ compliance with its constituent values. This step was reflected in amendments to Article 7 TEU. The EU 14 -Austria crisis, as here presented, illustrates the claim that Union-wide crises can {{have a positive effect on}} its normative foundation...|$|E
