5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet {{was born}} on 16 July 1949 in Tarutung, North Tapanuli Regency, North Sumatra. She was the fifth of ten {{children}} born to Saladin Sarumpaet, Minister of Defence in the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebel government, and Julia Hutabarat, a women's rights activist. Both were also prominent in the Christian community. Three of her siblings– Mutiara Sani, Riris Sarumpaet and Sam Sarumpaet– {{are members of the}} Indonesian art community. As a teenager she moved to Jakarta to study there, finishing her high school studies at PSKD Menteng. In his biography, her classmate Chrisye recalled that Sarumpaet was very confident; he noted that she enjoyed writing poetry and then reading it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> while other students were engaging in other activities.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E

25|$|That morning, Colonel Israel Angell's 2nd Rhode Island Regiment was ferried {{across the}} Delaware from Fort Mifflin to assist Greene's 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Altogether, Greene {{commanded}} about 500 defenders. Soon afterward, a Hessian drummer beat a parley and Major Charles Stuart, {{accompanied by a}} Hessian officer, came forward to demand the fort's surrender. Greene sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeremiah Olney to meet the British major. Though Stuart threatened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> that no quarter would {{be given to the}} defenders, Olney refused. Du Plessis later related to François-Jean de Chastellux that Stuart's overbearing tone inspired the defenders to greater resistance.|$|E
25|$|The hymn is {{of great}} antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event {{assigned}} by the Greek Menology as connected to its origin. The tradition recounts that {{during the reign of}} Theodosius II (408-450), Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the emperor and the Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople (434-446) were praying for heavenly assistance, a child was suddenly lifted into midair, to whom all cried out Kyrie eleison ('Lord, have mercy'). The child was then seen to descend again to the earth, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> he exhorted the people to pray : 'Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal'. After giving this exhortation, the child died.|$|E
25|$|There were testimonies of {{sightings}} of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews {{stayed in the}} smoking room for some time, then continued assisting with the evacuation. At around 2:00a.m., he was seen back on the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but there were still women reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and {{to draw attention to}} himself, Andrews waved his arms and announced to them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to cling to in the water, though he may have been mistaken for chief baker Charles Joughin, who survived the sinking and reported doing the same thing. He then headed towards the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship in its final moments. His body was never recovered.|$|E

500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|In a July 1951 {{profile in}} Book of the Month Club News, Salinger's friend and New Yorker editor William Maxwell asked Salinger about his {{literary}} influences. Salinger responded: [...] "A writer, when he's asked {{to discuss his}} craft, ought {{to get up and}} call out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> just the names of the writers he loves. I love Kafka, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Proust, O'Casey, Rilke, Lorca, Keats, Rimbaud, Burns, E. Brontë, Jane Austen, Henry James, Blake, Coleridge. I won't name any living writers. I don't think it's right" [...] (although O'Casey was in fact living at the time). In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently deceased, writers: Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as [...] "Fitzgerald's successor". Salinger's [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" [...] has an ending similar to that of Fitzgerald's earlier published short story [...] "May Day".|$|E

500|$|... {{women in}} Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of {{movement}} and in practice {{are not allowed to}} drive motor vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [...] after {{what has happened in the}} Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> and this has had an impact on me." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, 2 December 1942, {{everybody}} assembled for the experiment. There were 49 scientists present. Although {{most of the}} S-1 Executive Committee was in Chicago, only Crawford Greenewalt was present, at Compton's invitation. Other dignitaries present included Szilard, Wigner and Spedding. Fermi, Compton, Anderson and Zinn {{gathered around}} the controls on the balcony, which was originally intended as a viewing platform. Samuel Allison stood ready with a bucket of concentrated cadmium nitride, which he was to throw over the pile {{in the event of}} an emergency. The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> George Weil, the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but [...] of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it [...] at a time, with measurements being taken at each step.|$|E

2500|$|Our Rabbis {{asked in}} a Baraita why [...] says, [...] "You shall set the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the curse upon mount Ebal." [...] cannot say so merely to teach where the Israelites were to say the blessings and curses, as [...] already says, [...] "These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people [...] [...] [...] and these shall stand upon Mount Ebal for the curse." [...] Rather, the Rabbis taught {{that the purpose of}} [...] was to {{indicate}} that the blessings must precede the curses. It is possible to think that all the blessings must precede all the curses; therefore the text states [...] "blessing" [...] and [...] "curse" [...] in the singular, and thus teaches that one blessing precedes one curse, alternating blessings and curses, and all the blessings do not precede all the curses. A further purpose of [...] is to draw a comparison between blessings and curses: As the curse was pronounced by the Levites, so the blessing had to be pronounced by the Levites. As the curse was uttered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> so the blessing had to be uttered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> As the curse was said in Hebrew, so the blessing had to be said in Hebrew.

2500|$|The term [...] "Horlicks" [...] {{was brought}} to {{prominence}} in July 2003, when then-British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw used it to describe irregularities in the preparation and provenance of the [...] "dodgy dossier" [...] regarding {{weapons of mass destruction}} in Iraq. Straw used the expression [...] "a complete Horlicks", instead of the more impolite [...] "make a complete bollocks of something". This euphemism stems from an advertising campaign for the Horlicks malt drink, where people were seen to be shouting [...] "Horlicks!" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> to give vent to stress or frustration. Eric Morecambe was also known to cough [...] "Horlicks!"

2500|$|The 1913 season, {{performed}} at the new Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, brought a new scandal, with The Rite of Spring, written by Stravinsky and choreographed by Nijinsky. [...] The shouts of the audience during the performance, both for and against the dancers, were so loud that the dancers could not hear the music; the choreographer, in the wings, had to count <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> to help them. The ballet transformed {{the way in which}} subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure. The outbreak of World War I and the subsequent Russian Revolution of 1917 left the Ballets Russes stranded in Paris.
