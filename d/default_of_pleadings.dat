40|$|Activism to {{help people}} facing the horrors of forced {{psychiatric}} drugging and electroshock. As {{set forth in the}} law review article, Involuntary Commitment and Forced Psychiatric Drugging in the Trial Courts: Rights Violations as a Matter of Course, by Jim Gottstein of PsychRights, 25 Alaska L. Rev. 51 (2008), "lawyers representing psychiatric respondents interpose little, if any, defense and are not discovering and presenting to judges the evidence of the harm to their clients. " In addition to lawyer indifference, most appointed lawyers do not have funding to obtain expert testimony even when they might want {{to do a good job}} for their clients. In trying to address this problem, PsychRights has agreed to make available certified copies of written testimony (affidavits) of Robert Whitaker 1 and Grace E.

50|$|Civil {{procedure}} {{is the body}} of law that sets out the rules and standards that courts follow when adjudicating civil lawsuits (as opposed to procedures in criminal law matters). These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced; what kind of service of process (if any) is required; the types <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> or statements <b>of</b> case, motions or applications, and orders allowed in civil cases; the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure; the conduct of trials; the process for judgment; various available remedies; and how the courts and clerks must function.|$|R
50|$|Different {{procedures}} {{apply in}} different courts. There {{is only a}} slight distinction between the procedures of the High Court {{and those in the}} Magistrate's Court; save where otherwise indicated, it is safe to assume that the form and content of the proceedings is the same. It is important to note, however, that both courts have their own empowering statutes and court rules. The Act, in each case, sets out what kinds of disputes may be heard by each court, and the rules prescribe how the disputes will be brought before court: that is to say, the form <b>of</b> <b>pleadings</b> and time limits.|$|R
