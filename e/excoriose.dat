5|$|In general, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has good}} {{resistance}} to most grape diseases, powdery mildew {{being the most}} noted exception. It is, however, susceptible to the vine diseases Eutypella scoparia and <b>excoriose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Grolleau {{is a high}} {{yielding}} grapevine that ripens reliably {{and relatively}} early for the cool climate Loire Valley-often right after Gamay. The vine produces medium-sized clusters clinging to the vine via its long, slender pedicels. The grapes are thin skinned with few phenolic compounds, but after veraison they produce color ranging from gray to bluish/black depending on the clone. There are currently five clones of the Grolleau vine authorized for viticulture in France. The vine tends to bud early which renders it susceptible to damage from spring frosts. Its long branches make its susceptible to wind damage, requiring that it be planted near hillside shelter. Grolleau is sensitive to several grape diseases including <b>excoriose</b> and stem rot.|$|E
40|$|The {{disease of}} grapevines known as <b>excoriose</b> {{has been the}} source of a certain amount of controversy. Much of this {{concerns}} the identity of the causal agent and this has been further confounded by the taxonomic problems of the fungal pathogens associated with this disease. Many of these problems have now been resolved and it is clear that <b>excoriose</b> is caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea while cane blight and leaf spot is caused by Phomopsis viticola. However, although at least five different species of Phomopsis are currently known to be associated with grapevines, only P. viticola causes cane blight and leaf spot. The role played by the other species of fungi is not clear, but they may be weak pathogens, saprophytes or endophytes...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} Botryosphaeria, {{including}} Botryosphaeria dothidea, B. obtusa, B. parva and B. australis, were isolated and/or described from declining grapevines {{in association with}} a wide range of decline and dieback symptoms. Internal wood symptoms most commonly included black streaking, wedge-shaped necrosis and brown internal necrosis. Several diseases under names such as <b>excoriose,</b> grapevine decline syndrome and black dead arm have been described for decline and dieback symptoms associated with Botryosphaeria. This has led to the confusing situation where the same symptoms and causal species are often associated with more than one disease. This review summarises the research on Botryosphaeria on grapevine by focusing on the causal species, their associated symptoms, known epidemiology and possible effective control and management strategies...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaDifferent {{species in}} Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are {{commonly}} associated with black dead arm, bot canker, dieback, <b>excoriose</b> and esca diseases of grapevine. These grapevine trunk diseases are of major importance in Portugal and in many other grapevine growing regions of the world. The phenotypic and molecular characterisation of 43 Botryosphaeriaceae isolates, obtained from grapevine propagating materials, young and mature vine plants, allowed the identification of B. dothidea (two isolates), “B”. obtusa (19 isolates), “B”. stevensii (three isolates), “B”. viticola (one isolate), “B”. lutea (one isolate), “B”. parva (14 isolates) and “Botryosphaeria” spp. (three isolates). This is the first record of “B”. viticola in Portugal. Pathogenicity tests carried out with Botryosphaeriaceae isolates in grapevine (in vivo assays) revealed the intra-specific variation among isolates. The efficacy of tebuconazol, pyraclostrobine, pyraclostrobine+metiram and cyprodinil+fludioxonil fungicides as mycelial growth inhibitors was confirmed against B”. parva, “B”. obtusa, “B”. lutea e “B”. stevensii, being cyprodinil+fludioxonil the best fungicide tested (lowest EC 50 values). The efficacy of pyraclostrobine, metiram, and pyraclostrobine+metiram as spore germination inhibitors was confirmed against “B”. parva and “B”. obtusa, being pyraclostrobine+metiram the best fungicide tested (lowest EC 50 values). The potential use of such fungicides to control the Botryosphaeriaceae diseases {{in the field is}} promising, as often in the same vine different Botryosphaeriaceae species are present. This would also allow the alternation of products to avoid resistance risks...|$|E
40|$|Tunisian {{table grape}} {{production}} has significantly increased since two decades due to vineyards regional expansion and yield improvement. But, since several years, decline symptoms on Vitis vinifera {{have been recorded}} in some areas. A study case of a vineyard in Naassen area (near to Tunis) was chosen to investigate the disease origin and the physiological, biochemical, and histological modifications associated with vine decline. The investigation revealed characteristic symptoms on leaves, old and young shoots similar to decline symptoms of Grapevine Trunk Diseases. Based on cultural characteristics, laboratory investigations revealed the presence of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp., Diplodia seriata and Botryosphaeria dothidea, from root and shoot samples, respectively. These fungi are known as the main pathogens responsible for the Esca, Black dead arm and <b>Excoriose.</b> Molecular analysis confirmed the identification of Diplodia seriata. Beside morphological alterations on leaves and shoots, symptomatic vines presented significant reductions of 30 and 20 % in trunk diameter and bud break rate, respectively, and delayed spring growth compared to healthy ones. Furthermore, roots and stems from declined vines contained 3 times more starch than those from asymptomatic ones. Decline survey revealed a heterogeneous dispersion of symptoms in the vineyard in accordance with water supply. The vines {{along the edge of}} vineyards are usually less watered and show more decline symptoms. Decline dynamics in time and space scales have to be considered in order to develop effective management strategies...|$|E
