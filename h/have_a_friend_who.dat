500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} {{that he had been}} thinking about [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{are their}} years and {{appearance}} similar? I ask; for I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> has {{been guilty of}} some boyish tricks, and has tried the seas, I hear, among other foolish hazards." ...|$|E
50|$|Victor is {{featured}} in The 700 Club Asia where he shared his changed life. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> realization when he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> committed suicide.|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{brought over}} <b>a</b> dress from Paris, not as high-toned as that, that cost five hundred dollars," [...] said Clinton Grey.|$|R
5000|$|Comedian Adam Carolla was a {{stand-in}} {{for one of}} the [...] "bad guy" [...] actors. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> was the AD. It was {{his first}} foray into film.|$|R
6000|$|Father Tiebout smiled good-humoredly. [...] "We {{will not}} discuss the point just now. The {{question}} is what must be done? We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> will walk straight into the jaws of the lion unless--some one--warns him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Julien, {{the matter}} is of some importance," [...] Foster persisted. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is anxious to meet you. It would be an affair of a few words only, and perhaps an {{appointment}} afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Miss Beverley," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{is chief}} {{in this country}} of a {{department}} which I will not name. Will you dine with me to-night and let me invite him to meet you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Charles Main, I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> died one day. A metal casket {{held his}} honored clay. [...] Of cyclopean {{architecture}} stood The splendid vault {{where he was}} laid away.|$|R
500|$|Ned's store [...] "The Leftorium" [...] first {{appeared}} in [...] "When Flanders Failed". It was suggested by George Meyer, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> owned <b>a</b> left-handed specialty store which failed.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must arrange it--I shan't fail. She {{moreover}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{may also}} be there"--Milly found herself going on to this. [...] "He's likely to come, I believe, for he always follows her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Press," [...] she said, [...] "have {{all those}} things cut and dried. No doubt if you made friends with that young man he would let you read your {{obituary}} notice. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> has corrected the proofs of his already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends!" [...] {{interrupted}} Inez, glancing {{her eyes}} around the little tent in quest {{of the form}} of Ellen. [...] "I, too, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> must not be forgotten, but who is pledged to pass the remainder of her life with us. She is gone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she ought}} to make a will," [...] said Miss Cushing. [...] "That's the long and short of it; and {{she ought to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> would tell her so. That {{would be no more}} than a Christian duty which any one of us would owe to another, if cases were changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Out of {{the gate}} rushed Cowan, the frightened villagers {{scattering}} right and left. Antoine <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> lived in this street, and in ten minutes there was rum in the powder-horns, and the toast was [...] "On to Detroit!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom DeLonge: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who's</b> got <b>a</b> girlfriend that's the {{cheating}} type. It's {{a terrible}} situation where my friend is being crushed {{from the inside}} out by all the manipulative stuff she's doing and this song's about that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Two of my men <b>have</b> allowed <b>an</b> Insurgent {{to escape}} them, {{for which they}} will be rewarded. It is, however, evident that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> cut his bonds, and when we find him that man will also be duly compensated.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{thank you}} for your good intention, but I must decline your offer. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> would be uneasy were he to hear that I am hurt and away from him. The injury is but slight, and the bullet has missed the bones; but I believe, sir, you will now admit me title to the venison.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a matter}} of business," [...] Tavernake replied. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is a partner with me in the Marston Rise {{building}} speculation, and he is worried because there is some one else in the field wanting to buy the property, and the day after to-morrow is our last chance of paying over the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{considering}} the matter," [...] Mr. Bentley said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{lives on the}} trolley line a little beyond the hospital, a widow. It is like the country there, you know, and I think Mrs. Bledsoe could be induced to take the Garvins. And then something can be arranged for him. I will find an opportunity {{to speak to him}} this morning." ...|$|E
50|$|Carmina herself {{lives with}} her husband, Antonio, a man who retains a fondness for alcohol, against his doctor's advice. In her inn she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> strange {{assistant}} named Basilio. She also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> likes telling her about her experiences with celebrities, which are patently lies.|$|R
50|$|Russell's mother <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{worked at}} Ford Models agency, and Russell decided {{to sign with}} that agency in 2003. She later moved on to DNA Model Management in 2006, {{switched}} to Women Management in 2008, and then moved to Elite Model Management in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Ranked {{second most}} popular. Easy {{to talk to}} and loves sports. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> once betrayed him {{and he could not}} trust anyone again. His smiles and laughs prove to be fake. He loves his dog, whom you can {{normally}} find going on a walk with.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, Master Gregory. While {{you have been}} away, today, I have been {{thinking}} over what I should do, when you went away. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> comes in, once a week, with fruit and vegetables. Last year, you know, I went out with her and stayed a day. She has two boys {{who work in the}} garden, and a girl. She came in today, and I said to her: ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{my private}} doubts {{in regard to}} this matter of price. I am afraid that Euphemia {{generally}} set down the lowest price and the best things. She {{did not mean to}} mislead, and her plan certainly made our book attractive. But it did not work very well in practice. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> undertook to furnish her house by our book, and she never could get the things as cheaply as we had them quoted.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the throne}} of Cæsar, lady," [...] he exclaimed {{in a voice that}} carried a {{conviction}} of his earnestness, staring hard at the bust of Ithiel before him, [...] "as it chances, although I am not an artist, I do know something of sculpture, since I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is held to be the best of our day, and often for my sins have sat as model to him. Well, I tell you this--never did the great Glaucus produce a bust like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but I {{hear that}} it's charming, there. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> was there last year, {{and he said}} it was charming. The only trouble is it's so far. You're pretty {{well on the way to}} Europe when you get there. You know it's all hotel life?" ...|$|R
50|$|Simon and the Witch is a children's book by Margaret Stuart Barry, {{published}} by Collins, illustrated by Linda Birch. It also {{refers to the}} name of the series, which follows on. Simon is a very sensible young schoolboy, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is <b>a</b> real witch. She is very silly, and a huge showoff.|$|R
5000|$|The serious work Observations on {{the popular}} antiquities of Great Britain, of 1849, calls it [...] "Goose-riding" [...] and says it has been [...] "practiced in Derbyshire within the memory of persons now living", and that the antiquary Francis Douce (1757-1834) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> remembered it [...] "when young" [...] in Edinburgh in Scotland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> scolds me," [...] she confided. [...] "Sometimes {{he almost}} loses {{patience}} with me. He declares that my attitude toward {{life is too}} analytical. When happiness comes my way, I shrink back. I keep my emotions in the background, while my brain works, dissecting, wondering, speculating. Perhaps {{what he says is}} true. I believe that if one gets into the habit of analyzing too much, one loses all elasticity of emotion, the capacity to recognize and embrace the great things when they come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} needs {{polishing}} and practice and all that; but I'm {{sure it is}} oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle {{we see in the}} papers, and I know that some of those pieces are paid for, because I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is in a newspaper office, and he told me so. Yours are quaint and simple and some very original. I'm sure that ballad of the old house is lovely, and I want to send it to Whittier. Mamma knows him; it's the sort he likes, and he is so kind to every one, he will criticise it, and be interested when she tells him about you. Do let me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, yes. It {{is great}} folly and {{waste of time}} and money; yet I have known one man who found some good in it, or, rather, brought good out of it. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> has a mania for giving. His own fortune was spent in helping needy {{students}} at the University, and poor professors. This displeased his father, and he refused supplies, except enough for his simple personal wants. Sigismund chafed at this, and being skilful at all games, as a gentleman may be in the way of amusement, he resolved to play with those whose money was wasted on frivolities, and give his winnings to his band of paupers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he could. My father <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> left <b>a</b> {{little dog}} in Paris; and the {{creature}} {{found her in}} Milan, and died of fatigue next day. That was very wonderful, but true; and I've no doubt that if Sanch is alive he will come home. Let us hope so, and be happy, while we wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Fred," [...] {{retorted}} Sam, [...] "never {{mind what}} I mean; only attend to what I say. Don't be too particular. It's {{a bad habit}} being too particular. I once <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> was too particular in his attentions to a young lady, {{and the result was}} that he was obliged to marry her." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{replacement}} {{happened on}} the premiere of the season, when Fernando Orozco was eliminated for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> works as <b>a</b> director in the channel, which is against {{the rules of the}} show, as anyone who has any type of relationship with a Globo's employee is not allowed to be contestant in the program. He was replaced by Felipe Cobra.|$|R
