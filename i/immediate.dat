5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at <b>immediate</b> risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the <b>immediate</b> danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the <b>immediate</b> landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the <b>immediate</b> impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both <b>immediate</b> and longer-term problems. <b>Immediate</b> problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E

5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an <b>immediate</b> reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more <b>immediate</b> reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
5|$|Delayed <b>immediate</b> post-extraction implant {{placement}} (two {{weeks to}} three months after extraction).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less <b>immediate</b> relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the <b>immediate</b> family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} there was no <b>immediate</b> prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War {{but there was an}} <b>immediate</b> need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 1279–1281, Przemysł II {{had a rather}} {{friendly}} (or at least neutral) relationship {{with all of his}} <b>immediate</b> neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Even {{when the}} change in {{pressure}} causes no <b>immediate</b> symptoms, rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON). DON can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression.|$|E
5|$|Finland's {{recommendation}} {{to the crisis}} countries is to issue asset-backed securities to cover the <b>immediate</b> need, a tactic successfully used in Finland's early 1990s recession, in addition to spending cuts and bad banking.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} 2014 Sochi Olympics the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. The West responded with {{sanctions}} targeted at Putin's <b>immediate</b> entourage, and Bukovsky expressed {{the hope that}} this would prove {{the end of his}} regime.|$|E

5|$|Hansell left Guam on January 21, 1945. Unknown at the time, his {{precision}} daylight attacks had succeeded, {{first in}} Japan's <b>immediate</b> and inefficient dispersion of its aircraft engine industry, {{and later in}} terms of actual destruction caused by the final raid under his command. A more <b>immediate</b> legacy of his command was his creation, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Navy, of an effective air-sea rescue system that saved half of all B-29 crews downed at sea in 1945.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{a report}} {{estimated}} that there are just 7,100 cheetahs in the wild {{and that they are}} rapidly heading towards extinction. The authors suggest an <b>immediate</b> re-categorisation of the species from vulnerable to endangered.|$|E
5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a {{boundary}} layer {{is an important}} concept and refers to the layer of fluid in the <b>immediate</b> vicinity of a bounding surface where the effects of viscosity are significant.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{brachytherapy}} {{alone is}} used to deliver APBI (accelerated partial breast irradiation), involving delivery of radiation to only the <b>immediate</b> region surrounding the original tumour.|$|E

5|$|Rocks sampled in the <b>immediate</b> {{vicinity}} of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations of the <b>immediate</b> landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|Sir: Yours of {{this date}} proposing Armistice, and {{appointment}} of Commissioners, to settle terms of Capitulation is just received. No terms except unconditional and <b>immediate</b> surrender can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|Stirling led {{two units}} of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the <b>immediate</b> command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the <b>immediate</b> command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson's Connecticut {{regiment}} with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee {{and stop the}} British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck was {{published}} in July 1908 after heated discussions with publisher Harold Warne about the dialogues and cover illustration. The book was an <b>immediate</b> success.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an <b>immediate</b> cause for the action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned. Borisav Jović, a contemporary high-ranking Serbian official {{and member of the}} Yugoslav Presidency, has claimed that the report was just wartime propaganda, stating that Banja Luka had two bottled oxygen production plants in its <b>immediate</b> vicinity and was virtually self-reliant in that respect.|$|E
5|$|The driveway/parking lot {{and grounds}} <b>immediate</b> {{to the highway}} were used as a filming {{location}} for the 1970 science-fiction television movie The Love War.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of <b>immediate</b> or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the <b>immediate</b> reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|The first Roman republican wars were wars of both {{expansion}} and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its {{territory in the}} region. Initially, Rome's <b>immediate</b> neighbours were either Latin towns and villages, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated the Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii. By {{the end of this}} period, Rome had effectively completed the conquest of their <b>immediate</b> Etruscan and Latin neighbours, and also secured their position against the <b>immediate</b> threat posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.|$|E
