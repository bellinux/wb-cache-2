There is some debate about the overall impact of anesthetic drugs relative to carbon dioxide, but {{there is no question that}} practice patterns can limit the degree of environmental contamination. In particular, careful attention to managing fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> can use anesthetic drugs more efficiently— reducing waste while achieving the same effect on the patient. The environmental impact of a single case may be minimal, but when compounded over an entire career, the manner in which fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> is managed by each individual practitioner can make a significant difference in the volume of anesthetic gases released into the atmosphere. The maintenance phase of anesthesia is the best opportunity to reduce fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> because <b>circuit</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations are relatively stable and it is often the longest phase of the procedure. There are, however, methods for managing fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> during induction and emergence that can reduce the amount of wasted anesthetic vapor. This article provides background information and discusses strategies for managing fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> during each phase of anesthesia with the goal of reducing waste when using a circle anesthesia system. Monitoring oxygen and anesthetic gas concentrations is essential to implementing these strategies safely and effec-tively.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundVentilatory muscle {{endurance}} training (VMET) involves increasing {{minute ventilation}} (V˙E) against a low flow resistance at rest {{to simulate the}} hyperpnea of exercise. Ideally, VMET must maintain normocapnia {{over a wide range}} of V˙E. This can be achieved by providing a constant fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to a sequential rebreathing circuit. The challenge to make VMET suitable for home use is to provide a source of constant fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to the <b>circuit</b> without resorting to compressed gas. MethodsOur VMET circuit was based on a commercial sequential gas delivery breathing circuit (Pulmanex Hi-Ox, Viasys Healthcare, Yorba Linda, CA USA). Airflow was provided either by a small battery-driven aquarium air pump or by the entrainment of air down a pressure gradient created by the recoil of a hanging bellows that was charged during each inhalation. In each case, fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> was adjusted to be just less than resting V˙E. Eight subjects then breathed from the circuit for three 10 min periods consisting of relaxed breathing, breathing at 20 and then at 40 L/min. We monitored V˙E, end-tidal PCO 2 (PetCO 2) and hemoglobin O 2 saturation (SpO 2). ResultsDuring hyperpnea at 20 and 40 L/min, PetCO 2 did not differ significantly from resting levels with either method of supplying fresh gas. SpO 2 remained greater than 96 % during all tests. ConclusionIsocapnic VMET can be reliably accomplished with a simple self-regulating, sequential rebreathing circuit without the use of compressed gas...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Sound pressure levels generated by neonatal helmet CPAP delivery were measured at different <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> (20, 30, and 40 l/min) with and without a breathing filter. Noise intensity was measured by installing microphones in the inner ear of dummy heads wearing helmets.
