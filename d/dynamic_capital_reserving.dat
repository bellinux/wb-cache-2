The lack of <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements gave these banks the possibility to pursue their business with inadequate <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> and encouraged them to gamble. In addition the lack of personal liability for homeowners created {{in a similar way}} an exaggerated willingness to take risks and thus caused the United States housing bubble. To correct this situation Sinn has called for considerably higher <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, the balancing of offshore business and a return to the accounting principle of the lower of cost of the German Commercial Code (HGB).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the idea}} of model risk in the environment of internal model building. We define various types of model risk including estimation risk, model risk in distribution and model risk in functional form. By the quantification of these concepts we analyze {{the impact of the}} modeling process of an econometric model on the resulting company model. Utilizing real insurance data we specify, estimate and simulate various linear and nonlinear time series models for the inflation rate and examine its impact on pension liabilities under the aspect of model risk. Under consideration of different risk measures it is shown that model risk can differ profoundly due to the specification process of the econometric model resulting in remarkable monetary differences concerning <b>capital</b> <b>reserves.</b> We furthermore propose a specification strategy for univariate time series models and demonstrate that thereby market risk and <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> can be reduced distinctively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the case for}} the {{relationship}} between <b>dynamic</b> <b>capital</b> structure management and sustainable value creation has been argued. The dissertation addresses the need for dynamic rather than static capital structure management. Research has been done on capital structure dynamics with the intention of developing a model for improved and <b>dynamic</b> <b>capital</b> structure management for sustained value creation. The author has provided a theoretical overview of the two Modigliarii and Miller (M&M) propositions, capital structure models and the most important factors determining an appropriate capital structure for a company. Empirical research has been done on JSE listed companies in the industrial sector for the period 1997 - 2006. The relationship between capital structure determinants and sustainable value creation, as reflected in company share prices, has been investigated as part of the empirical study. The results from the statistical analyses have been used to develop a model for <b>dynamic</b> <b>capital</b> structur...|$|R

Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz recommends that regulations be established to limit the extent of leverage permitted and not allow companies to become [...] "too big to fail", by breaking them up into smaller entities. He has also recommended reforming executive compensation, to make it less short-term focused; enhance consumer protection; and establish a regulatory review mechanism for new exotic types of financial instruments.|$|R
