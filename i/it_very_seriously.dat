Responding to the complaints of many readers, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that [...] "The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't always taken <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say." [...] Times senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of New York Times coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) and its tone.|$|E
500|$|The {{frequency}} of the ritual reached its climax {{during the reign of}} Charles II (r. 1660–1685), the only English monarch who applied royal touch more than French kings. Over 92,000 scrofulous people were touched by him – over 4,500 annually. James II (r. 1685–1688) was very skeptical about the ritual but nevertheless indulged in it. He was deposed by William III (r. 1689–1702) and Mary II (r. 1689–1694), who refused to take part in what they considered a superstition. When a subject asked him for a touch, William reputedly said: [...] "God grant you better health and better sense." [...] Anne (r. 1702–1714) reintroduced the practice almost as soon as she ascended, touching 30 people on 6 October and 20 on 19 December 1702. She took <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously,</b> even fasting the day before. On 30 March 1712, she performed the ritual for the last time; Samuel Johnson (1709–1784) was the last of the 300 scrofulous people Anne touched that day. George I (r. 1714–1727) permanently discontinued the practice, but the exiled James II's Jacobite heirs claimed the ability until the 1780s.|$|E

[...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'"

He takes <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously,</b> even when it's comedy". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: [...] "He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.|$|E

Actress Elizabeth Olsen discussed how the film returns to the roots of the original Godzilla film and its themes as well, stating, [...] "There's a strong theme about the importance of family in it as well as the theme of trying to control nature and how that backfires in the end." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{important}} and admirable {{characteristic of the}} FDG framework is that <b>it</b> takes <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> the fact that utterances are produced and understood in context. Given this fact, {{the aim of the}} present paper is to articulate, in more detail than hitherto, how context may be treated and described within FDG, and to provide FDG with a more comprehensive contextual framework than has previously been available. At the beginning of the paper some general principles of context are established. It is then shown how context may be internally categorised, to reveal a complex multidimensional structure. In the light of this, {{a modified version of the}} FDG framework is proposed. The proposed model is then applied to the functional description of some aspects of Modern English, with a view to showing how the application of the framework enables a more analytical and perspicuous description of the pragmatics involved. The areas illustrated are constituent order, fragmentary text, clauses with unexpressed elements, and the inferencing of information. It is concluded that the framework makes possible a more exact and detailed treatment of the role played by context in language-use than would otherwise be feasible...|$|R
6000|$|Then Aunt Emmeline {{began to}} think about <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> It was very unpleasant.

Sir Thomas had been profuse with his presents even when Ayala had been most persistent in her misbehaviour. And then all that affair of the Marchesa, and even Mr. Traffick's infatuation! If Ayala wished that she were somewhere else would it not be well to indulge her wish! Aunt Emmeline certainly wished it.

5000|$|Painters were {{considered}} by Vasari and other writers {{to be especially}} prone to melancholy {{by the nature of}} their work, sometimes with good effects for their art in increased sensitivity and use of fantasy.

[...] A famous allegorical engraving by Albrecht Dürer is entitled Melencolia I. This engraving has been interpreted as portraying melancholia as the state of waiting for inspiration to strike, and not necessarily as a depressive affliction.
