This paper {{uses the}} gray {{correlation}} theory {{to carry out}} a quantitative study on the supportive role of producer services in manufacturing industry of Guangxi province based on the statistics of Guangxi’s high-end producer services and manufacturing industry between 2008 and 2013. The study result shows that while the correlation is relatively high between manufacturing industry and producer services like scientific research, technical <b>service,</b> <b>geological</b> <b>prospecting</b> <b>service,</b> commercial service, financial service, and real estate service, it is still low between manufacturing industry and emerging producer services including information transmission, computer service, and software industry. Therefore, Guangxi should strive to balance the development of high-end producer services, so as to give a full play to its supportive role in manufacturing industry development...|$|R
