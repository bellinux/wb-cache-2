5|$|Across the series, Sora is {{depicted}} as a cheerful teenager who cherishes his <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> relies on them for his strength. As a result, several of Sora's enemies use his friends as bait to use the Keyblade for their purposes. During the first game, it is discovered that Sora {{was not meant to}} wield the Keyblade, which only chooses him in the absence of its intended owner, Riku. However, Sora's greater strength of heart causes the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora.|$|E
5|$|Crews still form {{based on}} <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> neighborhoods. For example, dance crew Diversity—formed in 2007—consists of {{brothers}} and friends from Essex and London. Crews also form {{for other reasons}} such as theme (Jabbawockeez), gender (ReQuest Dance Crew), ethnicity (Kaba Modern), dance style (Massive Monkeys), and age (Hip Op-eration). In 2013, Hip Op-eration performed an exhibition routine at the World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas. At the time, their youngest member was 66.|$|E

40|$|Sociological {{approaches}} to <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> happiness {{focus on how}} broader social and cultural conditions influence <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> happiness. Long-standing debates about the 2 ̆ 7 good life 2 ̆ 7 on which sociological theory draws, include some attention to friendship as an important intimate relationship in promoting well-being. Sociologists note that friends confer social and emotional capital {{that has the potential}} to enhance happiness, offering opportunities to network, as well as emotional support, information, trust, financial support, and influence. Sociological perspectives examine the changing historical definitions of happiness <b>and</b> <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> critically evaluate whether <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> happiness contribute to individual subjective well-being or are used in social control. Sociological attention to <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> happiness also debates their contribution to social cohesion versus {{the ways in which they}} may exacerbate social inequalities. What a sociological contribution to happiness <b>and</b> <b>friendship</b> can offer is further illustrated using two examples of <b>friendship</b> <b>and</b> happiness in different social spheres; one taken from a study of <b>friendships</b> at work <b>and</b> the other from research into how friendships are navigated through online social media like Faceboo...|$|R

5|$|Kertész {{worked in}} the {{settings}} of many famous homes and notable places, as well as overseas, where he traveled again in England, Budapest and Paris, renewing <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> making new ones. During the 1945–62 period at House and Garden, the magazine published more than 3,000 of his photographs, and he created a high reputation in the industry. With little time for his personal work, Kertész felt starved {{of being able to}} exercise more artistic creativity.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the {{subsequent}} United States declaration of war upon Italy rendered Segrè an enemy alien and cut him off from communication with his parents. Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and Raymond T. Birge asked him to teach classes to the remaining students. This provided a useful supplement to Segrè's income, and he established important <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> professional associations {{with some of these}} students, who included Owen Chamberlain and Clyde Wiegand.|$|E
5|$|Miles' storylines {{have often}} centred on his <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> romantic {{relationships}} with other characters. He has become a surrogate father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her. Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three Inside Soap Awards.|$|E

5|$|As Shaw grew older, his {{reputation}} as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that she took his surname, until Shaw's death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, {{he said he did not}} feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother's <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> prospects for a more stable relationship.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E

25|$|A {{study done}} by Frankel et al. showed that parental {{intervention}} and instruction {{plays an important}} role in such children developing friendships. Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.|$|E
25|$|In general, female-female {{friendship}} {{interactions among}} {{children tend to}} be more focused on interpersonal connections and mutual support, while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on social status, and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs. Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their <b>friendships,</b> <b>and</b> males report higher levels of physical victimization. Although males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.|$|E

25|$|Three {{researchers}} {{who wrote about}} psychological life on kibbutzim were Melford E. Spiro (1958), Bruno Bettelheim (1969) and Michael Baizerman (1963). All concluded that a kibbutz upbringing led to individuals' having greater difficulty in making strong emotional commitments thereafter, such as falling in love or forming a lasting friendship. On the other hand, they appear to {{find it easier to}} have a large number of less-involved <b>friendships,</b> <b>and</b> a more active social life.|$|E
25|$|Participation in GROW {{has been}} shown to {{decrease}} the number of hospitalizations per member as well as the duration of hospitalizations when they occur. Members report an increased sense of security and self-esteem, and decreased anxiety. A longitudinal study of GROW membership found time involved in the program correlated with increased autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, self-acceptance and social skills. Women in particular experience positive identity transformation, build <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> find a sense of community in GROW groups.|$|E

Vette's career also suffered, as his crusade for truth had ended <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> caused conflicts with Air New Zealand, his employer at the time.
