5000|$|Carl Malamud {{has responded}} to the suit: [...] "It is a long-held tenet of American law {{that there is no}} {{copyright}} in the law. This is because the law belongs to the people and in our system of democracy {{we have the right to}} read, know, and speak the laws by which we choose to govern ourselves. Requiring a license before allowing citizens to read or speak the law would be a violation of deeply-held principles in our system that the laws apply equally to all.....This principle was strongly set out by the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall when they stated “the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right.” Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834). The Supreme Court speciﬁically extended that principle to state law, such as the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, in Banks v. Manchester (128 U.S. 244, 1888) , where it stated that “the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which, binding every citizen, is <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> to all, whether it is a declaration of unwritten law, or an interpretation of a constitution or a statute."" ...|$|E
