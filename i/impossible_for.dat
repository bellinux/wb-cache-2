5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> us to do that, and quite frankly I would {{think of it as}} boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Benign conditions, {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Coffin to find a replacement to run the company {{so that he could}} return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E

5|$|Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or MS Edgerton 1995, is {{the name}} given to a fifteenth-century English chronicle. It {{takes its name from}} its {{supposed}} author, William Gregory, who started as a skinner in London. Greogory {{went on to become a}} London Alderman, Sheriff from 1436 to 1437, and eventually Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The name 'Gregory' for the manuscript is, however, merely a convenience, as its actual authorship is unknown. Indeed, since the chronicle spans the period 1189 to 1470, and William Gregory died in 1467, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to have composed it in its entirety. Other fifteenth-century authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> historians to definitively attribute the authorship to any known individual.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 2009, Cook was {{diagnosed}} with a parathyroid tumor in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords making it virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to perform. He was treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.|$|E

5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again {{and told him}} of Hindley's confession, which at first he refused to believe. Once {{presented}} {{with some of the}} details that Hindley had provided of Pauline Reade's abduction, Brady decided that he too was prepared to confess, but on one condition: that immediately afterwards he be given the means to commit suicide, a request with which it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the authorities to comply.|$|E
5|$|Route 37 was redefined in the 1964 {{state highway}} {{renumbering}} as a route starting at SR 251, then SR 17, near Nicasio and ending at I-80 near Lake Chabot. The whole of SR 37 {{has been proposed}} to be built to freeway standards since the early 1950s. However, the proposal was met with many economic and environmental obstacles, making the task all but <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> much of the route.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to land.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> her to get a fair trial there.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of {{international}} safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division's {{lines of}} {{communication}} were now fully extended, and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from Romani made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that it had been}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any passenger aboard the Hughes Airwest DC-9 to survive the collision, disintegration, and crash of the aircraft.

5|$|The {{coming of}} winter {{improved}} the water situation for some who {{had access to}} icicles, but the cold made living conditions worse. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> those in hiding to build fires to warm themselves, as smoke could reveal their location to the Germans. As a consequence, many died of cold.|$|E

5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or <b>impossible)</b> <b>for</b> an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of}} the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
