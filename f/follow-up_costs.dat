50|$|There are {{indirect}} {{and direct}} {{costs associated with}} needlestick injuries. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that requiring hospitals to use safety-engineered needles would result in substantial savings due to the reduction in needlestick injuries requiring treatment. Costs of needlestick injuries include prophylaxis, wages and time lost by workers, quality of life, emotional distress, costs associated with drug toxicity, organizational liability, mortality, quality of patient care, and workforce reduction. Testing and follow-up treatment for healthcare workers who experienced a needlestick injury was estimated at $5,000 in the year 2000, depending upon the medical treatment provided. The American Hospital Association found that a case of infection by blood-borne pathogens could cost $1 million for testing, follow-up, and disability payments. An estimated $1 billion annually is saved by preventing needlestick injuries among healthcare workers in the US, including fees associated with testing, laboratory work, counseling, and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Traumatization in {{childhood}} {{can result in}} lifelong health impairment and may {{have a negative impact}} on other areas of life such as education, social contacts and employment as well. Despite the frequent occurrence of traumatization, which is reflected in a 14. 5 percent prevalence rate of severe child abuse and neglect, the economic burden of the consequences is hardly known. The objective of this prevalence-based cost-of-illness study is to show how impairment of the individual is reflected in economic trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> borne by society as a whole in Germany and to compare the results with other countries’ costs. Methods From a societal perspective trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated using a bottom-up approach. The literature-based prevalence rate includes emotional, physical and sexual abuse as well as physical and emotional neglect in Germany. Costs are derived from individual case scenarios of child endangerment presented in a German cost-benefit-analysis. A comparison with trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> in Australia, Canada and the USA is based on purchasing power parity. Results The annual trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> total to a margin of EUR 11. 1 billion for the lower bound and to EUR 29. 8 billion for the upper bound. This equals EUR 134. 84 and EUR 363. 58, respectively, per capita for the German population. These results conform to the ones obtained from cost studies conducted in Australia (lower bound) and Canada (upper bound), whereas the result for the United States is much lower. Conclusion Child abuse and neglect result in trauma <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> of economically relevant magnitude for the German society. Although the result is well in line with other countries’ costs, the general lack of data should be fought in order to enable more detailed future studies.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{determine}} and compare initial treatment costs of microsurgery, linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery, and gamma knife radiosurgery in meningioma patients. Additionally, the <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> in the first year after initial treatment were assessed. Cost analyses were performed at two neurosurgical departments in The Netherlands from the healthcare providers' perspective. A total of 59 patients were included, of whom 18 underwent microsurgery, 15 underwent LINAC radiosurgery, and 26 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. A standardized microcosting methodology was employed to ensure that the identified cost differences would reflect only actual cost differences. Initial treatment costs, using equipment costs per fraction, were € 12, 288 for microsurgery, € 1, 547 for LINAC radiosurgery, and € 2, 412 for gamma knife radiosurgery. Higher initial treatment costs for microsurgery were predominantly due to inpatient stay (€ 5, 321) and indirect costs (€ 4, 350). LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery were equally expensive when equipment was valued per treatment (€ 2, 198 and € 2, 412, respectively). <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were slightly, but not significantly, higher for microsurgery compared with LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery. Even though initial treatment costs were over five times higher for microsurgery compared with both radiosurgical treatments, our study gives indications that the relative cost difference may decrease when <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> occurring during the first year after initial treatment are incorporated.

This study aims to determine initial and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> for cardiovascular (CV) events in US managed care enrollees and to compare to healthcare costs for matched patients without CV events. Methods A 5. 5 -year retrospective matched cohort analysis of claims records for adult enrollees in ~ 90 US health plans. Patients hospitalized for first CV event were identified from a database containing a representative sample of the commercially-insured US population. The CV-event group (n = 29, 688) was matched to a control group with similar demographics but no claims for CV-related events. Endpoints were total direct medical costs for inpatient and outpatient services and pharmacy (paid insurance amount). Results Overall, mean initial inpatient costs were US dollars ($) 16, 981 per case (standard deviation [SD] = $ 20, 474), ranging from $ 6, 699 for a transient ischemic attack (mean length of stay [LOS] = 3. 7 days) to $ 56, 024 for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (mean LOS = 9. 2 days). Overall mean health-care cost during 1 -year follow-up was $ 16, 582 (SD = $ 34, 425), an excess of $ 13, 792 over the mean cost of matched controls. This difference in average costs between CV-event and matched-control subjects was $ 20, 862 and $ 26, 014 after two and three years of follow-up. Mean overall inpatient costs for second events were similar to those for first events ($ 17, 705 /case; SD = $ 22, 703).

40|$|Study objectives: The {{influence}} of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) on costs after lung transplantation was investigated {{by comparing the}} costs of patients with and without this condition. Design: <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> were prospectively investigated in a medical technology assessment of the Dutch Lung Transplant Program, {{in relation to the}} development of the BOS. First, average <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> per week per patient were compared between patients who did or did not develop BOS. Second, in the BOS group, these costs were compared before and after the onset of BOS. Setting: Dutch Lung Transplant Program, University Hospital of Groningen. Results: Data on 53 patients (37 patients without BOS and 16 with BOS) who underwent transplantation between November 1990 and April 1995 were available. The average follow-up time of these 53 patients was 1. 5 years. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> amounted to an average (in Dutch guilders [Dfl]) of 1, 774 /wk for non-BOS patients, compared to 3, 072 /wk for BOS patients (+ 73 %; p = 0. 002; one Dfl = 50 cents US currency). This difference in costs was largely accounted for by an increase in used health-care resources, in particular hospitalization and medication. For the BOS patients, the average costs per week before and after the onset of BOS were 1, 941 Dfl and 2, 422 Dfl, respectively. Conclusion: BOS is associated with substantial extra costs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the hospital-related costs of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment and cost structure between endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR) in Korean health care system. One hundred five primary elective AAA repairs (79 OSRs and 26 EVARs) performed in the Seoul National University Hospital from 2005 to 2009 were included. Patient characteristics were similar between two groups except for older age (P = 0. 004) and more frequent history of malignancy (P = 0. 031) in EVAR group. Thirty-day mortality rate was similar between two groups and there was no AAA-related mortality in both groups for 5 yr after repair. The total in-hospital costs for the index admission were significantly higher in EVAR patients (mean, KRW 19, 857, 119) than OSR patients (mean KRW 12, 395, 507) (P < 0. 001).

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{compared}} {{the hospital and}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> of patients who have undergone endovascular (EVAR) or open (OR) elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. MethodsThe records of 195 patients (EVAR, n = 55; OR, n = 140) who underwent elective aortic aneurysm repair between 1995 and 2004 were reviewed. Primary costing data were analyzed for 54 EVAR and 135 OR patients. Hospital costs were divided into preoperative, operative, and postoperative costs. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> for EVAR patients were recorded, with a median follow-up time of 12 months. ResultsMean preoperative costs were slightly higher in the EVAR group (AU $ 961 /US $ 733 vs AU $ 869 /US $ 663; not significant). Operative costs were significantly higher in the EVAR group (AU $ 16, 124 /US $ 12, 297 vs AU $ 6077 /US $ 4635; P <. 001); this was entirely due to the increased cost of the endograft (AU $ 10, 181 /US $ 7, 765 for EVAR vs AU $ 476 /US $ 363 for OR). Postoperative costs were significantly reduced in the EVAR group (AU $ 4719 /US $ 3599 vs AU $ 11, 491 /US $ 8, 764; P <. 001). Total hospital costs were significantly greater in the EVAR group (AU $ 21, 804 /US $ 16, 631 vs AU $ 18, 437 /US $ 14, 063; P <. 001). The increase in total hospital costs was due to {{a significant difference in}} graft costs, which was not offset by reduced postoperative costs. The average follow-up cost per year after EVAR was AU $ 1316 /US $ 999. At 1 year of follow-up, EVAR remained significantly more expensive than OR (AU $ 23, 120 /US $ 17, 640 vs AU $ 18, 510 /US $ 14, 122; P <. 001); this cost discrepancy increased with a longer follow-up. ConclusionsEVAR results in significantly greater hospital costs compared with OR, despite reduced hospital and intensive care unit stays. The inclusion of <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> further increases the cost disparity between EVAR and OR. Because EVAR requires lifelong surveillance and has a high rate of reintervention, <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> must be included in any cost comparison of EVAR and OR.

40|$|PURPOSE To {{explore the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of using drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty {{for the treatment}} of femoropopliteal arterial lesions, which has been shown to significantly lower the rates of target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with standard balloon angioplasty (BA). METHODS A simplified decision-analytic model based on TLR rates reported in the literature was applied to baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>costs</b> associated with in-hospital patient treatment during 1 year of <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Costs</b> were expressed in Swiss Francs (sFr) and calculated per 100 patients treated. Budgets were analyzed in the context of current SwissDRG reimbursement figures and calculated from two different perspectives: a general budget on total treatment costs (third-party healthcare payer) as well as a budget focusing on the physician/facility provider perspective. RESULTS After 1 year, use of DEB was associated with substantially lower total inpatient treatment costs when compared with BA (sFr 861, 916 vs. sFr 951, 877) despite the need for a greater investment at baseline related to higher prices for DEBs. In the absence of dedicated reimbursement incentives, however, use of DEB was shown to be the financially less favorable treatment approach from the physician/facility provider perspective (12 -month total earnings: sFr 179, 238 vs. sFr 333, 678). CONCLUSION Use of DEBs may be cost-effective through prevention of TLR at 1 year of follow-up.

40|$|Urolithiasis is a {{major source}} of {{morbidity}} in children of the third world. Since its advent in 1982 and despite uncertainties about the long-term effects on the kidney, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has rapidly replaced traditional surgery in the management of this condition. A retrospective study was conducted to compare the outcome of ESWL with that of open surgery in the management of paediatric urolithiasis in a single institution between November 1988 and December 1991. Emphasis was placed on the rate of stone clearance, complications, duration of <b>follow-up,</b> and <b>cost</b> of treatment of each modality. A total of 83 patients under 14 years of age underwent management of 101 stones; the stones were located in the kidneys (63), ureters (13), or bladder (25). Thirty-one patients who enrolled directly through the Lithotripsy Clinic underwent a total of 65 ESWL sessions for 44 calculi (mean, 2. 1 sessions per patient). The overall stone clearance rate was 82 %, with an 83 % clearance rate for renal stones. There were three failures. Nine patients did not return after the first ESWL session, {{and by the end of}} 6 months, 93. 5 % were lost to <b>follow-up.</b> The <b>cost</b> of ESWL ranged from $ 600 to $ 1, 000 (mean, $ 780).

The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuousrenal replacement therapy (CRRT) versus intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) and conservative (CONS) AKI treatment in Belgium. An area-under-the-curve model based on survival analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes using a 2 -year time horizon. Input data were derived from the multi-centre Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure 4 study. Analyses indicated that in-hospital mortality, hospitalization costs and hospital length of stay differed significantly between treatment modes. Follow-up mortality rates and <b>follow-up</b> <b>cost</b> per day showed no significant difference between the treatment modes. Utility values, which improved gradually after admission to the hospital, revealed no significant differences between the three treatment strategies. CONS treatment was associated with a 2 -year cost of 33 802 Euro and 0. 54 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The CRRT was the most expensive therapy with a cost of 51 365 Euro leading to 0. 57 QALYs. The cost and QALYs associated with IRRT were 43 445 Euro and 0. 50, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated the oin-hospital mortality' as the variable with the greatest influence on the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in a significant difference in treatment costs but no significant difference in QALY gain. This study has indicated that the most expensive treatment (CRRT) associated with an incremental cost of approximately Euro 7920 generates only a minor non-significant increase in QALYs of 0. 07 compared with IRRT. Additionally, the results revealed that the RRTs did not result in a significant increase in QALYs despite their higher cost compared with the CONS treatment. From a health economic perspective, the latter seems to be the preferred treatment strategy...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: To {{estimate}} short- {{and long-term}} costs of inpatient hospitalization in Sweden for major diabetes mellitus-related events. Materials and methods: Costs were estimated using administrative hospital {{data from the}} Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, which {{is linked to the}} Swedish National Diabetes Register. Data were available for 179 [*] 749 patients with diabetes in Sweden from 1998 to 2003 (mean and median duration of 6 years' <b>follow-up).</b> <b>Costing</b> of inpatient admissions was based on Nordic diagnosis-related groups (NordDRG). Multiple regression analysis (linear and generalizing estimating equation models) was used to estimate inpatient care costs controlling for age, sex and co-morbidities. The data on hospitalizations were converted to costs (€) using 2003 exchange rates. Results: The average annual costs (linear model) associated with inpatient admissions for a 60 -year-old male in the year the first event first occurred were as follows: € 6488 (95 % CI 5034, 8354) for diabetic coma; € 6850 (95 % CI 6514, 7204) for heart failure; € 7853 (95 % CI 7559, 8144) for non-fatal stroke; € 8121 (95 % CI 7104, 9128) for peripheral circulatory complications; € 8736 (95 % CI 8474, 9001) for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI); € 10 [*] 360 (95 % CI 10 [*] 085, 10 [*] 643) for ischaemic heart disease; € 11 [*] 411 (95 % CI 10 [*] 298, 12 [*] 654) for renal failure; and € 14 [*] 949 (95 % CI 13 [*] 849, 16 [*] 551) for amputation. On average, the costs were higher when co-morbidity was accounted for (e. g. MI with co-morbidity was twice as costly as MI alone). Conclusions: Average hospital inpatient costs associated with common diabetes-related events can be estimated using panel data regression methods. These could assist in modelling of long-term costs of diabetes and in evaluating the cost effectiveness of improving care. ...|$|R

The 100 -h vocational rehabilitation comprises five modules: work participation coordination, graded activity, cognitive behavioral therapy, group education, and relaxation. The 40 -h vocational rehabilitation comprises work participation coordination and a well-reasoned choice from the other four modules. Four rehabilitation centers will participate in this study, each delivering both interventions. Patients will be randomized into one of the interventions, stratified for the duration of sick leave (< 6 weeks or ≥ 6 weeks) and type of sick leave (part-time or full-time). The primary outcome is work participation, measured by self-reported sick leave days, and will be assessed at baseline, mid-term, discharge, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are work ability, disability, quality of life, and physical functioning and will be assessed at baseline, discharge, and at 6 and 12 months <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Cost</b> outcomes are absenteeism, presenteeism, healthcare usage, and travelling costs. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal and employer perspectives. The results obtained from this study will be useful for vocational rehabilitation practice and will provide stakeholders with relevant insights into two versions of vocational rehabilitation.

40|$|Introduction: Malnutrition {{and growth}} {{deficiency}} {{are common in}} neurologically impaired children. Gastrostomy placement {{has been shown to}} result in significant catch-up growth, improved health of the child and reduction in family stress; its cost-effectiveness has not been investigated. Aims: Costs related to gastrostomy placement are estimated here from a prospective controlled study of children referred to a tertiary paediatric centre in the UK. Methods: Costs of inpatient stay, medication, tests, general practitioner consultations, community healthcare, equipment, and parents’ indirect costs were estimated at baseline and <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Costs</b> of the different types of gastrostomy surgery are given. Results: Results for both time periods were available for 54 of the 76 children recruited to the study. Five-day food diaries were kept at baseline and <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Costs</b> of food increased slightly but not significantly post surgery from £ 33 to £ 40 (€ 44 to € 54, US 65 to US 78) per week. Variation in cost between cases was considerable but the mean net cost difference of £ 20. 80 (CI −£ 43. 79 to £ 85. 35) (€ 28 (CI €− 59 to € 115), US 41 (CI US− 86 to US 167)) per week per child including for food and surgery, was also not significant. Community service costs were significantly lower post surgery. Few parents reported personal costs at either time point, although many had reduced or stopped paid work to care for the child. Conclusion: As gastrostomy placement for these children resulted in significant clinical benefit at no significant extra cost, it is concluded that the procedure is cost-effective...|$|E

40|$|Purpose : Adjuvant {{brachytherapy}} (AB) with immediate (IR) and staged reconstruction (SR) {{are distinct}} treatment modalities available {{for patients with}} recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Although SR may offer local control and toxicity benefit, it requires additional upfront procedures, {{and there is no}} evidence that it improves overall survival. With the importance of value-based care, our goal is to identify which technique is more cost effective. Material and methods : A retrospective review of 22 patients with recurrent extremity STS treated with resection followed by AB alone. Hospital charges were used to compare the cost between SR and IR at the time of initial treatment, at 6 -month intervals following surgery, and cumulative cost comparisons at 18 months. Results : Median follow-up was 31 months. Staged reconstruction (n = 12) was associated with an 18 -month local control benefit (85 % vs. 42 %, p = 0. 034), compared to IR (n = 10). Staged reconstruction had a longer hospital stay during initial treatment (10 vs. 3 days, p = 0. 002), but at 18 months, the total hospital stay was no longer different (11 vs. 11 days). Initially, there was no difference in the cost of SR and IR. With longer <b>follow-up,</b> <b>cost</b> eventually favored SR, which was attributed primarily to the costs associated with local failure (LF). On multivariate analysis, cost of initial treatment was associated with length of hospital stay (~$ 4. 5 K per hospital day, p < 0. 001), and at 18 months, the cumulative cost was ~ 175 K lower with SR (p = 0. 005) and $ 58 K higher with LF (p = 0. 02). Conclusions : In recurrent STS, SR has a longer initial hospital stay when compared to IR. At 18 months, SR had lower rates of LF, translating to lower total costs for the patient. SR is the more cost-effective brachytherapy approach in the treatment of STS, and should be considered as healthcare transitions into value-based medicine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{vocational}} rehabilitation {{is a widely}} advocated intervention for workers on sick leave due to subacute or chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, the optimal dosage of effective and cost-effective {{vocational rehabilitation}} remains unknown. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe the design of a non-inferiority trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 40 -h multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation compared with 100 -h multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation on work participation for workers on sick leave due to subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods/Design: A non-inferiority study design will be applied. The study population consists of workers who are on part-time or full-time sick leave due to subacute or chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain.

Methods: People with low back-related complaints were recruited from those referred to a spinal triage assessment program delivered by physiotherapists. Measures of patient and provider satisfaction were completed at approximately 4 weeks after the assessment. The satisfaction surveys were analyzed quantitatively with descriptive statistics and qualitatively with an inductive thematic approach of open and axial coding. Results: A total of 108 / 115 participants completed the posttest satisfaction survey. Sixty-six percent of participants were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the service and 55 % were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the recommendations that were made. Only 18 % of referring care providers completed the satisfaction survey and 90. 5 % of those were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the recommendations. Sixty-one participants and 14 care providers provided comments which revealed a diverse range of themes which were coded into positive (ie, understanding the problem, communication, customer service, efficiency, and management direction), negative (ie, lack of detail, time to <b>follow-up,</b> <b>cost)</b> and neutral related to the triage service, and an &ldquo;other&rdquo; category unrelated to the service (ie, chronic symptoms, comorbidities, and limited access to health care.) Conclusion: The quantitative results of the participant survey demonstrated very high levels of satisfaction with the service and slightly less satisfaction with the recommendations that were made. Satisfaction of referring care providers with the recommendations and report was also high, but given the low response rate, these results should be interpreted with caution. Qualitative analysis of participant and provider comments revealed a diverse range of themes. These other issues may be important contextual factors that {{have the potential to}} impact patient relevant outcomes.
