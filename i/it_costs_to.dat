Jon Lauckner, a Vice President at General Motors, responded that the study did not consider the inconvenience of a [...] electric range and that the study's cost estimate of [...] per [...] for the Volt's battery pack was [...] "many hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour higher" [...] than what <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> make today." ...|$|E

The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, [...] "I know. It's too bad.

500|$|Criticism {{was also}} raised {{regarding}} the relatively few convictions. Despite several people's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party, only Wilson {{was charged with}} assault, and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged. NC1 admitted to having sex with another under-age girl at the party, though he was not charged with that offence. With {{the exception of the}} charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation, nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries. During a report on Radio National, Leigh's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged, he asked her if she knew [...] "how much <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> run an investigation".|$|E
500|$|According to Marx, capitalists take {{advantage}} of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference [...] "surplus value" [...] and argued that this surplus value had its source in surplus labour, the difference between what <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> keep workers alive and what they can produce. Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as vampires sucking worker's blood, {{but at the same time}} he notes that drawing profit is [...] "by no means an injustice" [...] and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system. The true problem lies with the [...] "cancerous cell" [...] of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.|$|E

[...] After there are production cars that can use straight vegetable oil and a standard type available at gas stations, consumers will probably choose straight vegetable oil to save money.

[...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her when she had to change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he was really quite harmless. She remained neutral during the great theater strikes of 1827 and 1834.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout its history, the Mekorot {{has been}} financially stable {{according}} to information published on its website. In 2006, Mekorot's turnover was over $700 million, shareholders' equity was $500 million and total assets were {{in excess of}} $2.8 billion. In 2006, Mekorot invested over $240 million in developing water facilities, including a new central filtration plant, compared with $180 million in investments in 2005. For {{a number of years}} Mekorot's fundraising instruments (primarily, bond offerings) have been awarded the highest AAA rating by the [...] credit rating agency based on the following factors: Because tariffs established by the government are low and do not cover Mekorot's operating costs, the company receives compensation for the difference between what <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> produce a unit of water and what it is allowed to charge. The level of subsidies is fixed in multi-annual agreements, the first one having covered the period 1993–98, the second one 1998–2006 and the third one for a much shorter period, 2007–08.|$|E

2500|$|Skills are {{categorized}} by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, {{and the cost}} per skill level increases with each level of difficulty. [...] Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to {{raise the level of}} the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills. [...] A player can generally purchase a skill for his character at any level he or she can afford. [...] The lower you choose the fewer points <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> buy the skill, and the higher you go, the more points it costs. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12-5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, he could {{have a better chance of}} success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{the balloon}} and the {{arrangements}} under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister’s directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost {{to the government of}} commissioning and operating The Skywhale over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic Aranday Foundation will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company Global Ballooning and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time. In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that [...] "this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities". Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of The Skywhales operating costs. Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented [...] "a bargain for public art". Piccinini has also said that [...] "it's an aeronautical machine. People's lives depend on it. It has to function properly and that's what <b>it</b> <b>costs,</b> <b>to</b> make a balloon". While Global Ballooning owns The Skywhale, Piccinini retains the intellectual property to the balloon and the company does not expect to make much money from displaying and operating it. The director of Global Ballooning believes that The Skywhale will become self funding when international galleries begin to exhibit it.|$|E
