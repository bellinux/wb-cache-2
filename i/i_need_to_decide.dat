40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential relationship of accessible hands-on science learning experiences {{to the development of}} positive beliefs concerning one’s capacity to function in the sciences and motivation to consider science as a college major and career. Findings from Likert survey items given before and after engaging in accessible hands-on science laboratories show that students who were blind or had low vision (BLV) were more likely to agree with the following items after engaging in accessible science experiences: 1) I plan on enrolling as a science major in college; 2) My educational experiences, so far, have given me the confidence that <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> on majoring in an area of science in college and then a career in science; 3) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently perform a lab activity in (on) ______; 4) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently start data collection during a lab activity in ______; 5) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently stop data collection on a lab activity in ______; 6) I was actively involved in data collection during the______ lab. The Likert survey findings are consistent with the notion that accessible science activities may foster the development of self-beliefs that one has the capacity to independently function in scientific domains, which may promote an inclination to consider scientific pursuits. Insufficient accessible science learning experiences may contribute to the underrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Providing accessible science learning activities may help to increase both the number of individuals who have disabilities and diversity in the STEM fields...|$|E
40|$|The British Columbia Political Studies Association Conference was a short, productive, no-frills conference, {{in which}} I {{actively}} participated in every session and {{was rewarded with}} a stimulating and useful discussion of my own paper. On the morning of Friday May 2, I attended a panel on “Questioning Political Theory”, in which political theorists dicussed {{the relative merits of}} foundationalism and social constructivism in recent political theory, and I contributed to the discussion by raising the relevance of Rawls’s political liberalism and of Kuhn’s and Popper’s philosophy of science to the presenters’ remarks. Professor Barbara Arneil’s Keynote Address, “Competing Models of Social Capital Building in Diverse Communities: The Girl Scouts vs. the Boy Scouts of America” provoked a stimulating discussion that raised some intereting comparisons with Canada as well as perspectives on social capital theory. I participated vigorously in the roundtable debate on BC politics as well. My own paper was moved to the panel on “International Public Policy”, the last full panel held on Saturday May 3. My paper received several useful comments. The official discussant, Dr. Gerald Baier of the University of British Columbia, noted that Prof. Grace Skogstad refers to trade as an instance of multilevel governance, and that future revisions should take into account the multilevel governance literature, as well Paul Pierson’s Politics in Time. He noted that the principal point of the paper was about how the more market-based health care reforms are, the less insulated we are from international trade obligations. He wondered whetehr there was a parallel concern on the U. S. side—e. g. can consulting firms doing EDS and security be challenged under ITAs? Why are Swedish corporations not specializing in health care delivery aboroad? Gail Williams was cited as saying that you “can make domestic policy through international trade agreements” [...] -was I implying that governments are unaware of the poison pill of difficult-to-reverse privatizations? If so, this remained unproven. Chris Kukucha (Lethbridge) commented that states are pretty autonomous—e. g. the United States is willing and able to resist international regulation. Trade policy is also a case of what Cairns has called “centralizing intrastate federalism”—i. e. provincial interests are taken into account. In Canada, most trade people are in intergovernmental affairs, so the absence of trade policy capacity in social ministries may be misleading. Ontario officials said “daycare is already on our radar” 2 or 3 years ago; Stephen Elliott-Buckley (Phd. Candidate, SFU) commented that BC was thinking about trade obligations when it made its announcement about ABC daycare centres recently (by making sure subsidies are available for everyone). Matt James (UVIC) offered the suggestion that the arguments could be contextualized in terms of old debates from federalism and public policy—i. e. the capacity of provincial governments is something that Watkins and Gordon would tend to denigrate (echoing the earlier sentiments of centralists) whereas Pratt and Richards would speak highly of their savvy. Implications of Conference Comments and Discussions: I benefitted from having several discussions relating to major theoretical issues in contemporary political science. It is clear from the comments on my own paper that {{there is at least one}} line of empirical enquiry and 2 or 3 theoretical and comparative works that I need to consult before revising my paper for publication. First, I need to interview some trade policy officials to determine their influence on social policy decisions. While some statements in the press seem to indicate a degree of indifference to foreign/corporate ownership and consequent trade obligations. Secondly, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether lack of provincial trade policy capacity is an important part of my thesis about healthcare reform, exposure to trade rules, and the nature of globalization. Thirdly, I need to examine curent theoretical works on multilevel governance—and Pierson’s and Williams’s and Cerny’s work on the nature of the modern welfare state—as well as older works such as Laski’s on the obsolescence of federalism, the provincial state, and so on. Waldron’s recent critique of risk analysis by Cass Sunstein might also be an appropriate source to consult, given my emphasis on risk analysis in my paper. IN short, the comments have been extremely helpful in prodding me to the next stage of my work—moving beyond a fascination with the relationships described in my paper to a sharper thesis that is more theoretically nuanced, empirically grounded, and contextualized within federalism and domestic and international governance. The paper argues that the ostensible exemption of domestic social policy fields from the application of international trade agreements actually results in the introduction of two powerful structures potentially constraining domestic policy actors: first, the introduction of new zones of legal contestation concerning the boundaries of domestic policy; and second, the creation of a new and inverse relationship between the presence of market factors in domestic policy and the applicable scope of trade agreement exemption clauses. The result is neither the "common international policy space" theorized by Ruggie nor the pure domestic policy space which existed prior to expansion of trade agreements to include services and domestic regulation. Rather, it is a space the boundaries of which are flexible, contested, and contingent upon both legal interpretation and the choice of policy instrument. Such a policy space demonstrates both the unavoidability of globalization and the continuing importance of the nation state, and potentially exhibits some distinctively new policy dynamics.

I would like to write my thesis about smart home possibilities (theoretically), which are available, or proposed to the market. Then I would like to make a business plan for hypothetical company which wants to arrive to the market with smart homes development. Finally, I would like to design (practically) part of smart home according to available technologies. I am more considered in the SW part of the problem, but I want to use real hardware if it would be possible rather then the simulator. The SW should be portable written in JAVA, developed on LINUX (better hardware support). It should be able to manage all smart home interfaces and extensible. Brain of the system should be Neural Network, which should be able to learn automatically the inhabitants behaviour and help them in their everyday routine.

I am an illustrator, and my language is line. I often illustrate text, an article, story, memoir, or poem that is not mine; breathing life into a body of letters, literally drawing out the most significant ideas. I also illustrate without words, letting the line alone do the speaking. The power pictures have when paired with words is extraordinary, and the relationship they have can create a deeper understanding of content. But images without words also tell a story, a narrative that lies within the contour of a face, the curve of a spine, or the wrinkle of an eyelid. Though I appreciate both of these modes of visual communication, the power of illustrations standing alone as well as accompanied by texts, I am most in awe of illustrators who can walk seamlessly through both modes because their talent, style and creative process allows them to make intuitive decision...|$|R
