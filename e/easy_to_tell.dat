25|$|While it is {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what a mitigation project or programme is (i.e. its contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and/or whether it increases the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb them), the blurred line between a general development project and an adaptation project has been a contentious issue in the international climate finance debate, including at Green Climate Fund Board meetings, {{according to a report}} by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E

25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling {{is the presence of}} notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.|$|E
500|$|Mt. Rainier {{appears on}} four {{distinct}} United States postage stamp issues. [...] In 1934, {{it was the}} 3-cent issue {{in a series of}} National Park stamps, and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention. [...] The following year, in 1935, both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends. [...] Because of complaints by the public, [...] "Farley's Follies" [...] were reproduced in large numbers. [...] The second stamp issue is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> from the original because it is imperforate. [...] Both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available.|$|E
500|$|Some surnames, like Bird, {{dating from}} 1193 onwards, with {{variants}} like Byrd and Bride, {{are most likely}} nicknames for a birdlike person, though {{they may also be}} metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds. Eagle from 1230 is a nickname from the bird, while Weasel, Wessel from 1193 and Stagg from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals. It is not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname Stallion, with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning [...] "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".|$|E

It is always <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> others what <b>to</b> do and even <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> others where <b>to</b> go. Too, since we are discussing “future” research, there is a standard litany that future research should always be driven by theory, while ignoring {{the question of what}} drives theorists. Such a litany underscores the importance of ritual in social life. Such litanies are important in the rituals of the research community...|$|R

500|$|In 1864 Wagner's {{financial}} position was transformed by his new patron, the 18-year-old King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who paid off the composer's debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend. Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg, and a grand house in Munich. [...] At Wagner's instigation, von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig's [...] "royal pianist"; he and Cosima moved to Munich, {{and took a}} house conveniently close to Wagner's, ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer's secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima {{spent more than a}} week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von Bülow joined them on 7 July. According to Wagner's housekeeper, Anna Mrazek, [...] "it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> that something was going on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner". [...] Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner's bedroom, but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation, either from Wagner or from his wife. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima gave birth to a daughter, Isolde. Such was von Bülow's devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own, and registered her as [...] "the legitimate daughter" [...] of Hans and Cosima von Bülow. [...] Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the Munich Hofoper, von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.|$|E

Its body is yellowish-grey and has three dark dorsal stripes running down its length; the legs also have dark stripes. S.coleoptrata has developed automimicry in that its tail-like hind legs present the appearance of antennae. When the centipede is at rest, it is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> its front from its back.|$|E
2500|$|A {{movement}} back to {{the earlier}} tradition of a deity being placed on the obverse occurred in Byzantine coinage, where a head of Christ became the obverse and a head or portrait (half or full-length) of the emperor became considered the reverse. The introduction of this style in the gold coins of Justinian II from the year 695 provoked the Islamic Caliph, Abd al-Malik, who previously had copied Byzantine designs, replacing Christian symbols with Islamic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive Islamic style, with just lettering {{on both sides of}} their coins. This script alone style then was used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period. [...] The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of Iconoclasm, and with variations remained the norm {{until the end of the}} Empire. Without images, therefore, it is not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which side will be regarded as the obverse without some knowledge.|$|E

Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice {{to show off the}} sleek Sony super machine to your friends. Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [...] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty." [...] He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded [...] "Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability {{to live up to the}} hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth taking a look at, but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness {{may not be}} what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E

[...] Pincus stated that [...] "the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. The money has to be centralthe money that's being challenged has to be central to the violation. Just as you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast". As in Bowen there had to be [...] "a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money". Pincus opined that no taxpayer would be given standing to sue agents of the United States Secret Service for accompanying a President on a trip for a religious purpose as they would be there [...] "protecting him for a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious purpose. And I think our submission {{is that there is a}} distinction that can be drawn there." ...|$|E
