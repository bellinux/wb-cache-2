5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>facto</b> laws, double jeopardy {{and freedom from}} self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board.

A co-optimization approach for <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing schema is proposed to calculate the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve.
