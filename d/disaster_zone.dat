C-17s also transported supplies to Fiji and Samoa in December 2012 following Cyclone Evan. In January 2013 two Globemasters flew power generators and transformers from Amberley to Hobart following the Tasmanian bushfires. Later that month C-17s were used to transport aviation fuel and other supplies into the Queensland town of Bundaberg after it was affected by heavy flooding. In November 2013 a Globemaster flew a civilian medical team and its equipment from Australia to Cebu in the Philippines {{as part of the}} relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan; an RAAF C-130 subsequently transported the medical team from Cebu to Tacloban in the <b>disaster</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a <b>disaster</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki a <b>disaster</b> <b>zone.</b> In {{accordance with}} the FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E

25|$|The {{logistics}} {{in which}} the delivery of humanitarian occurs can be problematic.

Although aid was flown in rapidly, regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.|$|E

25|$|The December 2003 Bam {{earthquake}} caused particular {{outrage and}} made clear {{the necessity for}} blogging as a news source.
