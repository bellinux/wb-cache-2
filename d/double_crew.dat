60|$|DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER,--I {{must take}} {{advantage}} of the opportunity now presented to write you, but I shall necessarily be dull, as I feel uncommonly stupid. We have had a hard trip this time. Left Saint Louis three weeks ago on the Pennsylvania. The weather was very cold, and the ice running densely. We got 15 miles below town, landed the boat, and then one pilot. Second Mate and four deck hands took the sounding boat and shoved out in the ice to hunt the channel. They failed to find it, and the ice drifted them ashore. The pilot left the men with the boat and walked back to us, a mile and a half. Then the other pilot and myself, with a larger crew of men started out and met with the same fate. We drifted ashore just below the other boat. Then the fun commenced. We made fast a line 20 fathoms long, to the bow of the yawl, and put the men (both crews) to it like horses, on the shore. Brown, the pilot, stood in the bow, with an oar, to keep her head out, and I took the tiller. We would start the men, and all would go well till the yawl would bring up on a heavy cake of ice, and then the men would drop like so many ten-pins, while Brown assumed the horizontal {{in the bottom of the}} boat. After an hour's hard work we got back, with ice half an inch thick on the oars. Sent back and warped up the other yawl, and then George (the first mentioned pilot,) and myself, took a <b>double</b> <b>crew</b> of fresh men and tried it again. This time we found the channel in less than half an hour, and landed on an island till the Pennsylvania came along and took us off. The next day was colder still. I was out in the yawl twice, and then we got through, but the infernal steamboat came near running over us. We went ten miles further, landed, and George and I cleared out again--found the channel first trial, but got caught in the gorge and drifted helplessly down the river. The Ocean Spray came along and started into the ice after us, but although she didn't succeed in her kind intention of taking us aboard, her waves washed us out, and that was all we wanted. We landed on an island, built a big fire and waited for the boat. She started, and ran aground! It commenced raining and sleeting, and a very interesting time we had on that barren sandbar for the next four hours, when the boat got off and took us aboard. The next day was terribly cold. We sounded Hat Island, warped up around a bar and sounded again--but in order to understand our situation you will have to read Dr. Kane. It would have been impossible to get back to the boat. But the Maria Denning was aground at the head of the island--they hailed us--we ran alongside and they hoisted us in and thawed us out. We had then been out in the yawl from 4 o'clock in the morning till half past 9 without being near a fire. There was a thick coating of ice over men, yawl, ropes and everything else, and we looked like rock-candy statuary. We got to Saint Louis this morning, after an absence of 3 weeks--that boat generally makes the trip in 2.|$|E

40|$|Title: Physiological {{response}} of competitors Fireball dinghy {{class in the}} model sailing race. Objectives: The main intention of the thesis is to detect the physical demands (difficulties) of sailing boat race categorized as Fireball <b>double</b> <b>crew.</b> The variables of physiological response to the load of competitors recorded are being measured using simulated race under laboratory conditions. At that point, this opportunity enabled us to carry out further comparisons and examine the physical demands of individual post at various directions of wind. Methods: The entire investigation of detecting physiological functions of competitors {{will be carried out}} noninvasively throughout the simulation of sailing using metabolic analyser tool and sport tester. From the feedback, we will obtained figures and originate the physiological {{response of}} human body to the load. Due to the investigation is being implemented on the <b>double</b> <b>crew</b> boat Fireball; both competitors (crew/helmsman) performing different tasks will be simulated and examined individually. Simulated race will last 24 minutes and competitors will have to face different wind courses, precisely cruising upwind, crosswind and tailwind.

30|$|These {{two methods}} of {{organisation}} are easily identified during a roadside survey: the feature of a <b>double</b> <b>crew</b> {{is simply that}} there are two drivers or more on board; while a relay is characterised {{by the fact that the}} driver and the freight do not have the same starting point and destination. They are thus identified by questions Q 11 to Q 15 in the RN 10 survey form. Note that the authors could identify one survey in which the number of drivers was observed [23]. However the data was not analysed and relays were not observed.|$|E

30|$|The {{organisation}} {{of transport}} operations {{is also a}} topic on which roadside freight surveys can yield useful information at a small additional cost.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on {{improving}} the observation and knowledge of interurban road freight transport. It investigates some directions {{for the improvement of}} a classic French road-side survey protocol, usually employed to gather origin-destination data. To do that, new questions are added to the classic roadside survey form, and the enhanced survey form is tested in the frame of two surveys. The new questions concern currently unobserved variables: the volume occupied by the freight in vehicles; the organizations (<b>double</b> <b>crew,</b> relays) set by motor carriers; the existence of specific logistic imperatives; and the breaks drivers have to take. The questions about the volume constraint and the organizations of carriers prove to be the most informative ones; as such, these two questions are two promising directions for improving French roadside surveys. The questions about specific logistic imperatives and about breaks prove less fruitful...|$|E
