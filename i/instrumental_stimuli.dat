40|$|The {{detection}} of salient or <b>instrumental</b> <b>stimuli</b> and {{the selection of}} cue-evoked responses are mediated by a fronto-parietal network that is modulated by cholinergic inputs originating from the basal forebrain. Visual cues that guide behavior are more strongly represented in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) than are similar cues that are missed or task-irrelevant. Although the crucial role of cholinergic inputs in cue detection has been demonstrated by lesion studies, the role of PPC neurons in the cholinergic modulation of cue detection is unclear. We recorded extracellular spikes from PPC neurons of rats performing a sustained attention task, before and after selective removal of cholinergic inputs to the recording site. Visual cues that were subsequently detected evoked significant increases in the PPC firing rate. In the absence of cholinergic input, the activation of PPC neurons by detected cues was greatly diminished. When a visual distractor was introduced during task performance, a population of PPC neurons selectively responded to the distractor. As a result of cholinergic deafferentation, distractor-related neuronal activity was enhanced, and the detection-related activity was further suppressed. Thus, in deafferented subjects, the distractor lowered the signal-to-noise ratio of cue-evoked responses. This impairment in cue-evoked neuronal activity may have mediated the increased response latencies observed for detected cues {{in the presence of}} the distractor. Additional experiments demonstrated that the effects of cholinergic deafferentation were not confounded by extended practice or electrode depth. Collectively, these findings indicate that cholinergic inputs to PPC neurons amplify cue detection, and may also act to suppress irrelevant distractors...|$|E
40|$|The motivational {{drive to}} natural rewards is {{modulated}} by prenatal glucocorticoid exposure C Soares-Cunha 1, 2, B Coimbra 1, 2, S Borges 1, 2, MM Carvalho 1, 2, AJ Rodrigues 1, 2 and N Sousa 1, 2 Exposure to {{elevated levels of}} glucocorticoids (GCs) during neurodevelopment {{has been identified as}} a triggering factor for the development of reward-associated disorders in adulthood. Disturbances in the neural networks responsible for the complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli are critical for disorders such as depression, obsessive–compulsive disorders, obesity and addiction. Essential in the understanding on how cues influence behavior is the Pavlovian–instrumental transfer (PIT), a phenomenon that refers to the capacity of a Pavlovian stimulus that predicts a reward to elicit instrumental responses for that same reward. Here, we demonstrate that in utero exposure to GCs (iuGC) impairs both general and selective versions of the PIT paradigm, suggestive of deficits in motivational drive. The iuGC animals presented impaired neuronal activation pattern upon PIT performance in cortical and limbic regions, as well as morphometric changes and reduced levels of dopamine in prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, key regions involved in the integration of Pavlovian and <b>instrumental</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Normalization of dopamine levels rescued this behavior, a process that relied on D 2 /D 3, but not D 1, dopamine receptor activation. In summary, iuGC exposure programs the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic circuitry, leading to a reduction in the attribution of the incentive salience to cues, in a dopamine-D 2 /D 3 -dependent manner. Ultimately, these results are important to understand how GCs bias incentive processes, a fact that is particularly relevant for disorders where differential attribution of incentive salience is critical.

40|$|Extinction is {{a unique}} {{learning}} process that requires the alteration of stimulus–response associations such that the organism ceases {{to respond to a}} previously rewarded stimulus. Extinction is mostly studied with fear conditioning and is impaired by lesions of the prefrontal cortex as well as by blockade of NMDA receptors in the amygdala. Because previous tasks could not clearly disambiguate extinction from behavioral disinhibition, the underlying process was difficult to define. In this study, we examined the possible role of NMDA receptors and the pigeon “prefrontal cortex, ” the neostriatum caudolaterale (NCL), for extinction of appetitive instrumental conditioning. We used a new design that discerns extinction from behavioral disinhibition. Our results demonstrate that NCL lesions cause deficits neither in extinction learning nor in extinction recall. However, blockade of NMDA receptors in the pigeon NCL by DL-AP- 5 drastically impairs extinction learning without producing behavioral disinhibition or deficits in extinction recall. We suggest that NMDA receptors in the NCL contribute to the establishment of a learning process that selectively signals the change in value of the <b>instrumental</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Although NCL plays a key role for extinction learning, other structures can subsume similar functions after postlesional regeneration.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted using an autoshaping procedure with pigeons {{to examine whether}} dimensional stimulus control by a Pavlovian facilitator parallels the control established following operant discrimination training. Facilitation training consisted of the presentation of a black vertical line on a white background as the B stimulus in a feature-positive discrimination in which the A stimulus (white keylight) was followed by grain presentation only if preceded by B. In this way, B facilitates or sets the occasion for pecking at A. Subsequent testing for generalization along the line-orientation dimension produced decremental gradients when the facilitation paradigm incorporated an explicit feature-negative stimulus (B−). These results parallel the decremental control obtained following operant discrimination training and suggest that Pavlovian facilitators and <b>instrumental</b> discriminative <b>stimuli</b> are functionally equivalent...|$|R

In this longitudinal fMRI study of stroke patients (N = 41) with a 6 -month follow-up, we used natural vocal music (sung with lyrics) and <b>instrumental</b> music <b>stimuli</b> to uncover brain activation and functional network connectivity changes associated with acquired amusia and its recovery. In the acute stage, amusic patients exhibited decreased activation in right superior temporal areas compared to non-amusic patients during instrumental music listening. During the follow-up, the activation deficits expanded to comprise a wide-spread bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal network. The amusics showed less activation deficits to vocal music, suggesting preserved processing of singing in the amusic brain. Compared to non-recovered amusics, recovered amusics showed increased activation to instrumental music in bilateral frontoparietal areas at 3 months and in right middle and inferior frontal areas at 6 months. Amusia recovery was also associated with increased functional connectivity in right and left frontoparietal attention networks to instrumental music. Overall, our findings reveal the dynamic nature of deficient activation and connectivity patterns in acquired amusia and highlight the role of dorsal networks in amusia recovery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the noise of echo-planar {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging on auditory cortex responses were compared for two methods of acquiring functional MR data. Responses observed with a distributed volume acquisition sequence were compared to those obtained with a clustered volume acquisition sequence. In the former case, slices from the volume were acquired at equal intervals within the repetition time, whereas the latter acquired all slices in rapid succession {{at the end of the}} imaging period. The clustered volume acquisition provides a period of quiet during which a stimulus may be presented uninterrupted and uncontaminated by the noise of echo-planar imaging. Both sequences were implemented on a General Electric Signa imager retrofitted for echo-planar imaging by Advanced NMR Systems, Inc. The sequences were used to acquire 60 images per slice of a fixed volume of cerebral cortex while subjects were presented an <b>instrumental</b> music <b>stimulus</b> in an On vs. Off paradigm. Data were acquired for both sequences using TR values of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 sec. The clustered volume acquisition sequence was found to yield greater measures of dynamic range (percent signal change, mean statistical power per unit imaging time) across the tested range of TR values. Observations of more consistent spatial extent of responses, greater mean signal changes, and higher and more consistent values of mean t-statisti...|$|R
40|$|Mowrer's (1947) and Spence's (1956) {{suggestion}} that classical conditioning {{may play a}} significant role in the acquisition and performance of instrumental responses has fostered two broad lines of research. One of these bas been concerned with the role of classcally conditioned responses in instrumental behavior (Wynne & Solomon, 1955; Solomon & Turner, 1962; Miller & DeBold, 1965; Williams, 1965) and bas produced mainly negative results. The proposition that the occurrence of certain classically conditioned responses (e. g., autonomic "anxiety" reactions, anticipatory goal responses, or rg) is an essential step in instrumental responding seems no longer tenable. The second line of research has examined the role of classically conditioned <b>stimuli</b> in <b>instrumental</b> behavior and is based on the assumption that in the course of <b>instrumental</b> training, certain <b>stimuli,</b> apart from whatever cue function they might serve in the control of the instrumental response, serve a motivational function by being classically paired with the reinforcement.

40|$|Synchronization of {{spatially}} distributed neural assemblies at frequencies in {{the range}} 30 – 70 Hz (the “gamma ” band) may be <b>instrumental</b> in grouping <b>stimulus</b> features. In agreement with this we have shown that detection reaction times to a grouping target stimulus are expedited when the stimulus is preceded by repeated presentation of a priming stimulus, presented below detection thresholds in a matrix that flickers at particular frequencies in the 27 – 68 Hz range. This dynamic priming effect can be partly explained {{as a function of}} the return phase of the priming stimulus relative to the premask matrix, indicating one of the primary consequences of repeating stimulation is pre-activation of a priming response relative to prime-stimulus presentation. However, this cannot entirely explain the relationship that develops between the timing of stimulus events (in this instance the time of target relative to priming-stimulus presentations) and response. By varying the frequency and phase of priming-stimulus and target presentations we discovered that given a particular relationship between the phase of target presentation relative to the return phase of the prime, target coding is expedited by a prime that achieves its maximum activation at a phase that woul...|$|R

Three groups of 10 normally-hearing (NH) listeners and one group of 10 CI users were asked to make dissimilarity judgments between pairs of <b>instrumental</b> sounds. The <b>stimuli</b> were 16 synthetic tones spanning a wide range of instrument families. All sounds had the same fundamental frequency (261 Hz) and were balanced in loudness and in duration.

The dissimilarity judgments were analysed using multidimensional scaling. We found that (1) for all groups, the first two dimensions of the timbre space were strikingly similar and correlated with the log of the attack time and with the spectral centroid, respectively, (2) NH subjects listening to unprocessed sounds gave relatively more weight to the attack time and less weight to the spectral centroid than the other three groups of subjects, (3) Noise-vocoded simulations appear to be a good model of timbre perception by CI subjects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Several {{studies have}} shown that the ability to {{identify}} the timbre of musical instruments is reduced in cochlear implant (CI) users compared with normal-hearing (NH) listeners. However, most of these studies have focused on tasks that require specific musical knowledge. In contrast, the present study investigates the perception of timbre by CI subjects using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) paradigm. The main objective was to investigate whether CI subjects use the same cues as NH listeners do to differentiate the timbre of musical instruments. DESIGN: Three groups of 10 NH subjects and one group of 10 CI subjects were asked to make dissimilarity judgments between pairs of <b>instrumental</b> sounds. The <b>stimuli</b> were 16 synthetic instrument tones spanning a wide range of instrument families. All sounds had the same fundamental frequency (261 Hz) and were balanced in loudness and in perceived duration before the experiment. One group of NH subjects listened to unprocessed stimuli. The other two groups of NH subjects listened to the same stimuli passed through a four-channel or an eight-channel noise vocoder, designed to simulate the signal processing performed by a real CI. Subjects were presented with all possible combinations of pairs of instruments and had to estimate, for each pair, the amount of dissimilarity between the two sounds. These estimates were used to construct dissimilarity matrices, which were further analyzed using an MDS model. The model output gave, for each subject group, an optimal graphical representation of the perceptual distances between stimuli (the so-called "timbre space"). RESULTS: For all groups, the first two dimensions of the timbre space were strikingly similar and correlated strongly with the logarithm of the attack time and with the center of gravity of the spectral envelope, respectively. The acoustic correlate of the third dimension differed across groups but only accounted for a small proportion of the variance explained by the MDS solution. Surprisingly, CI subjects and NH subjects listening to noise-vocoded simulations gave relatively more weight to the spectral envelope dimension and less weight to the attack-time dimension when making their judgments than NH subjects listening to unprocessed stimuli. One possible reason for the relatively higher salience of spectral envelope cues in real and simulated CIs may be that the degradation of local fine spectral details produced a more stable spectral envelope across the stimulus duration. CONCLUSIONS: The internal representation of musical timbre for isolated musical instrument sounds was found to be similar in NH and in CI listeners. This suggests that training procedures designed to improve timbre recognition in CIs will indeed train CI subjects to use the same cues as NH listeners. Furthermore, NH subjects listening to noise-vocoded sounds appear to be a good model of CI timbre perception as they show the same first two perceptual dimensions as CI subjects do and also exhibit a similar change in perceptual weights applied to these two dimensions. This last finding validates the use of simulations to evaluate and compare training procedures to improve timbre perception in CIs...|$|R
