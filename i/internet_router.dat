As the packet classification on multiple-fields is a difficult and time consuming problem, <b>Internet</b> <b>routers</b> need to classify incoming packet quickly into flows. In this paper, we present multi-phase packet classification architecture using an internal buffer for fast packet processing. Using internal buffer between address pair searching phase and remained fields searching phases, we can hide latency cones from the characteristic that search times of source and destination header fields are different. The proposed architecture is easy to apply to different needs due to its simplicity and generality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Packet {{classification}} is an enabling {{function in}} <b>Internet</b> <b>routers</b> {{for a variety}} of Internet applications. In order to classify Internet packets into flows, <b>Internet</b> <b>routers</b> must perform searches over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. Because of its speed and simple filter management the Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is currently the dominant hardware solution for IP lookups, i. e., a one-dimensional packet classification. To make TCAM the solution for the multi-dimensional packet classification, efficient methods that store the range fields of the classification tables in TCAM are needed. In this paper, we propose a set of novel range encoding schemes based on Gray code. Many range-encoding techniques are used to improve the existing elementary intervalbased range encoding schemes. The present experiment’s results show that the proposed Gray code-based schemes consume less TCAM storage space than the existing schemes. I...|$|R
