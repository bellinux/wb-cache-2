25|$|<b>House</b> <b>centipedes</b> {{lay their}} eggs in spring. In a {{laboratory}} observation of 24 <b>house</b> <b>centipedes,</b> an average of 63 and a maximum of 151 eggs were laid. As with many other arthropods, the larvae look like miniature versions of the adult, albeit with fewer legs. Young centipedes have four pairs of legs when they are hatched. They gain a new pair with the first molting, and two pairs with each of their five subsequent moltings. Adults with 15 pairs of legs retain that number through three more molting stages (sequence 4-5-7-9-11-13-15-15-15-15 pairs).|$|E
25|$|<b>House</b> <b>centipedes</b> live {{anywhere}} {{from three to}} seven years, depending on the environment. They can start breeding in their third year. To begin mating, {{the male and female}} circle around each other. They initiate contact with their antennae.

25|$|Unlike its shorter-legged {{but much}} larger {{tropical}} cousins, S.coleoptrata can live its entire life inside a building, usually the ground levels of homes. Though they often startle their unwitting housemates with their appearance and surprising speed, {{they are generally}} considered harmless to humans. Bites are uncommon, and the forcipules of <b>house</b> <b>centipedes</b> are {{not strong enough to}} easily penetrate human skin. Bites are similar to a bee's sting, with its venom causing redness and mild to severe swelling.|$|E
25|$|In {{a feeding}} study, S.coleoptrata showed {{the ability to}} {{distinguish}} between possible prey, avoiding dangerous insects. They also adapted their feeding pattern {{to the type of}} hazard the prey might pose to them. For wasps, they retreat after applying the venom to give it time to take effect. When the centipede is in danger of becoming prey itself, it can detach any legs that have become trapped. <b>House</b> <b>centipedes</b> have been observed to groom their legs by curling around and grooming them with their forcipules.|$|E
25|$|The Scutigeromorpha are anamorphic, {{reaching}} 15 leg-bearing {{segments in}} length. Also known as <b>house</b> <b>centipedes,</b> {{they are very}} fast creatures, and able to withstand falling at great speed: they reach up to 15 body lengths per second when dropped, surviving the fall. They are the only centipede group to retain their original compound eyes, within which a crystalline layer analogous to that seen in chelicerates and insects can be observed. They also bear long and multi-segmented antennae.

25|$|Scutigera coleoptrata – one {{of several}} species {{commonly}} known as the <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> – is a typically yellowish-grey centipede with up to 15 pairs of legs. Originating in the Mediterranean region, the species has spread {{to other parts of the}} world, where it can live in human homes. It is an insectivore; it kills and eats other arthropods, such as insects and arachnids.|$|R
50|$|Hexamers are {{characteristic}} of arthropod hemocyanins. A hemocyanin of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum {{is made up of}} 4 hexamers or 24 pepide chains. A hemocyanin from the <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> Scutigera coleoptrata is made up of 6 hexamers or 36 chains. Horseshoe crabs have an 8-hexamer (i. e. 48-chain) hemocyanin. Simple hexamers are found in the spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus and the isopod Bathynomus giganteus. Peptide chains in crustaceans are about 660 amino acid residues long, and in chelicerates they are about 625. In the large complexes there is a variety of variant chains, all about the same length; pure components do not usually self-assemble.|$|R
25|$|Outdoors, <b>house</b> <b>centipedes</b> {{prefer to}} live in cool, damp places. Centipede {{respiratory}} systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, {{and that is why}} they need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood, and especially in compost piles. Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost any part of the house. Most commonly they are encountered in basements, bathrooms, and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when they come out because the weather gets warmer, and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.|$|E
2500|$|<b>House</b> <b>centipedes</b> feed on spiders, bed bugs, termites, cockroaches, silverfish, ants, {{and other}} {{household}} arthropods. They administer venom through modified legs (forcipules). These {{are not part}} of their mandibles, so strictly speaking they sting rather than bite. They are mostly nocturnal hunters. Despite their developed eyes, they seem to rely mostly on their antennae when hunting. Their antennae are sensitive to both smells and tactile information. They use both their mandibles and their legs for holding prey. This way they can deal with several small insects at the same time. To capture prey they either jump onto it or use their legs in a technique described as [...] "lassoing". Using their legs to beat prey has also been described.|$|E

25|$|Centipedes {{grow their}} legs at {{different}} points in their development. In the primitive condition, exhibited by the Lithobiomorpha, Scutigeromorpha, and Craterostigmomorpha, development is anamorphic: more pairs of legs are grown between moults. For example, Scutigera coleoptrata, the American <b>house</b> <b>centipede,</b> hatches with only four pairs of legs and in successive moults has 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 15, 15 and 15 before becoming a sexually mature adult. Life stages with fewer than 15 pairs of legs are called larval stadia (about five stages). After the full complement of legs is achieved, the now postlarval stadia (about five stages) develop gonopods, sensory pores, more antennal segments, and more ocelli. All mature lithobiomorph centipedes have 15 leg-bearing segments.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the complete mitochondrial genome of the <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> Scutigera coleoptrata. Its gene order is unique among characterized arthropod mitochondrial genomes. Comparison to the gene {{order in the}} horseshoe crab mtDNA implies 10 or more translocations. By extending comparisons to 30 arthropod mitochondrial genomes plus two outgroups, we identify two different patterns of gene order change. The first, only affecting position and orientation of tRNAs, is much more frequent than the second, which also involves protein encoding and ribosomal genes. The analysis of the same data set using available algorithms for phylogenetic reconstruction based on gene order results in unreliable trees. This indicates that the current methods for analyzing gene order rearrangement are not suitable for wide-ranging phylogenetic studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the temporal organ (organ of Tomosvary) has been studied electrophysiologically in the Japanese <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> {Thereuonema hilgendorfi: Chilopoda). 1. Receptor cells of the temporal organ show spontaneous discharges (15 - 40 impulsess~l) which are depressed in a phasic-tonic manner by carbon dioxide stimuli. Perfusion of the presumed receptor site with a carbon dioxide-containing solution also changes the impulse frequency. 2. The impulse frequency of a receptor cell decreases linearly with a logarithmic increase in carbon dioxide concentration ranging from 0 - 001 % to 0 - 1 % in the phasic state and from 0 - 05 % to 5 - 0 % in the tonic state. These {{results suggest that the}} temporal organ of the <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> functions as a carbon dioxide receptor, though it responds to other stimuli as described below. 3. Changing the pH of a carbon dioxide-containing solution changes the impulse frequency, probably by changing the molar fraction of CO 2 molecules in the lymph surrounding the receptor site. pH also directly influences the impulse frequency of the receptor cell, but the effect is smaller than that of CO 2 molecules. 4. Receptor cells respond to humidity changes, but the response is smaller than that to carbon dioxide. When receptor cells are stimulated by moist air (100 % relative humidity, RH) after adaptation to dry air (0 % RH), the impulse frequency increases by a factor of 1 - 29 ± 0 - 37 (mean ± S. D. measured for the first second, N= 29), and 1 - 16 ± 0 - 28 (measured after adaptation to moist air, N = 29). 5. Air-borne chemicals also affect the impulse frequency of a receptor cell; it is increased by amines and decreased by fatty acids and aldehydes. Effects of these chemicals are discussed in relation to changing the pH of lymph bathing the receptor site...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{process of}} carbon dioxide {{reception}} in the temporal organ of the Japanese <b>house</b> <b>centipede</b> Thereuonema hilgendorfi has been studied by means of intracellular recording. 1. During adaptation to air containing no carbon dioxide, the membrane potential of receptor cells in the temporal organ ranged from — 25 to — 59 mV {{with an average of}} — 39 mV (N = 21). Input resistance ranged from 10 to 46 MQ with an average of 22 - 6 Mfl (AT = 16). 2. Receptor cells responded to a carbon dioxide stimulus with a graded hyper-polarizing receptor potential, which reduced impulse frequency. The decrease in steady-state frequency was proportional to the amplitude of the receptor potential. 3. During the receptor potential, the input resistance increased. Injection of hyperpolarizing current resulted in an increase in amplitude of receptor potential, while depolarizing current caused a decrease. These results suggest that the receptor potential is caused by a decrease in membrane permeability to ions whose equilibrium potential is more positive than the membrane potential adapted to 0 % carbon dioxide...|$|R

However, after Warstar was defeated by the Goseigers, Buredoran resumes his Yuumajuu guise as he releases Makuin and Kinggon, providing them with the enlarging Bibi Bugs (Bībi Mushi) and Demon Bug Soldiers Bibi. Sensing the Abare Headder, Buredoran manages to take it as his weapon by acting without the others and somehow tames it. However, Gosei Red manages to reach the Headder and convert it into the Miracle Dragon Headder, resulting in Buredoran's first defeat by the Goseigers as Makuin and Kinggon imprison him for his recklessness. Though eventually released, Buredoran proceeds to turn Kinggon against Makuin and take his place as Makuin's right-hand man in order to remove him from power. However, this scheme backfires and Buredoran is defeated by Ground GoseiGreat. Eventually, after aligning himself with the Gedoushu, Buredoran's remains are found by Metal-Alice, presenting him to Robogōgu who revives him as Buredo-RUN of the Cyborg.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in molecular phylogenetics are continuously changing {{our perception of}} the phylogenetic relationships among the main arthropod lineages: crustaceans, hexapods, chelicerates, and myriapods. Besides the intrinsic interest in unraveling {{the evolution of the}} largest animal phylum, these studies are basic to an understanding of one of the major transitions in animal evolution-i. e., the conquest of land with all its associated structural and functional adaptations. Myriapods have been traditionally considered the closest relatives of hexapods, thus implying only one origin of terrestriality for the tracheate lineage, but this view is now challenged by molecular evidence. Sequence data available to date for centipedes and millipedes are very limited, and the taxon sampling is strongly biased. The most critical gap was the scutigeromorph centipedes, which are the sister group to all remaining Chilopoda from which they probably diverged in the Silurian if not earlier. We obtained the first complete mitochondrial sequence for a representative of this clade, the <b>house</b> <b>centipede.</b> In our phylogenetic analyses of the protein-coding genes in this mitochondrial genome, along with 16 further ones representing the other major arthropod clades plus two outgroups, the myriapods formed a clade with the chelicerates. This implies that water-to-land transition occurred at least three times (hexapods, myriapods, arachnids) during the evolution of the Arthropoda. In addition, in contrast to all previous studies, our best supported topologies favor paraphyly of the myriapods with respect to the chelicerates. This would increase to four the main events of land colonization in arthropods (once for centipedes, once for millipedes) ...|$|R
