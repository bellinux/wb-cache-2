5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>surface,</b> and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped <b>joint</b> <b>surface.</b> Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
40|$|To {{research}} the dynamic {{characteristics of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> from the microperspective, the fractal prediction model of the normal contact damping of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> is established based on the “solid-gap-solid” contact model which was proposed by the author, tribology theory, and contact fractal theory. And the kinetic model of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> is improved to a certain extent. The influences of actual contacting area, friction coefficient, and the fractal dimension on the normal contact damping are revealed {{by the research of}} numerical simulation. Simulation results show that the normal contact damping of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> decreases to a constant value with the increase of actual contacting area, increases with the increase of friction coefficient, and decreases with the increase of fractal dimension. Actual contacting area influences the location of the turning point of the Cn*-μ (critical friction coefficient), and the critical friction coefficient increases with the increase of actual contacting area. Normal damping coefficient of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> continuously decreases with the increase of fractal dimension and the difference of magnitude exists between normal contact damping coefficients with different fractal dimension values...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{strength}} and rigidity of four methods of internal fixation for arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Ten matched pairs of cadav-eric first rays were harvested and arthrodesis performed by one of four techniques: (1) planar excision of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> and fixation with crossed Kirschner wires, (2) planar excision of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> and internal fixation with a dorsal plate and screws, (3) planar excision of <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> and internal fixation with an interfragmentary screw, or (4) excision of the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> using powered conical reamers and fixation with an interfragmentary lag screw. Biomechanical testing with a Bionix 858 materials testing machine was carried out, applying a plantar force utilizing principles of cantilever loading. Force applied and displacement of the arthrodesis were recorded. Of the four methods tested, bony preparation with power conical reamers and supplementary interfragmentary screw fixa-tion was the most stable...|$|R
25|$|Arthritis {{of joints}} {{involves}} {{inflammation of the}} synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} cutting the members to size and then drilling {{a series of}} holes in the <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> of each member. Holes are often drilled {{with the assistance of}} a dowelling jig which aids in accurate hole placement— accuracy is paramount in this technique to ensure members line up perfectly in the completed joint. The holes are drilled such that there are corresponding holes in each member into which short dowels are inserted with some glue. The joint is brought together and clamped until the glue has dried.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{methods of}} {{treating}} fractures {{have their own}} risks and benefits, but usually surgery is performed only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or {{likely to result in}} a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as hip fractures (usually caused by osteoporosis), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged immobilisation, which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism, which are more dangerous than surgery. When a <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> is damaged by a fracture, surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The machine <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> are {{necessary}} to form {{the functions of the}} complex mechanical system. Because the macro or micro relative motions may appear in the machine <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the vibration and friction phenomena will be excited, then the singularities, disturbances and faults of the mechanical system may be appeared when the machine equipments in the running process. These undesired phenomena will have adverse effect on the efficiency, precision, reliability and lifetime of the mechanical equipment. In order to ensure the functions and properties of the mechanical system, more attentions should be paid to mechanism of vibration and friction during the process of designing and manufacturing the modern machine. In this paper, machine <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> are classified by different classification standards: the macro relative motions and micro contact styles between the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The theories and methods for researching vibration and friction mechanism are inducted and summarized and the view of non-linear should be advocated for the future research. The point of precisely quantifying for machine assembly accuracy design while considered the relevancies between the macro and micro-scale of mechanical system indicates that new directions and methods for studying vibration and friction mechanism in machine <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> should be put forward...|$|R

50|$|As we age the {{characteristics}} of the sacroiliac joint change. The <b>joint's</b> <b>surfaces</b> are flat or planar in early life but as we start walking, the sacroiliac <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> develop distinct angular orientations and lose their planar or flat topography. They also develop an elevated ridge along the ilial surface and a depression along the sacral surface. The ridge and corresponding depression, along with the very strong ligaments, increase the sacroiliac joints' stability and makes dislocations very rare. The fossae lumbales laterales ("dimples of Venus") correspond to the superficial topography of the sacroiliac joints.|$|R

50|$|Before match-casting, pre-cast {{concrete}} bridge segments were connected using cast-in-place mortar joints. Cast-in-place joints {{meant that the}} sections were mortared together at the bridge construction site while cranes or structural supports held up the pre-cast segments. However, if match-cast sections were used, mortared joints were not necessary. Instead, an epoxy was applied to both surfaces of the sections to be joined. The sections fit perfectly together and no fillers were required to patch voids on the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Since there were no voids on the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> the entire cross-sectional area of the joint was in contact providing enough area to produce an extremely strong connection.|$|R
