50|$|The Puerto Rico National Guard, {{like the}} {{national}} guards in all 50 states, is a hybrid organization. national guards are ordinarily {{under the control of}} state (or, in the case of Puerto Rico, commonwealth) officials, but are organized pursuant to federal statute, and in war time or other <b>emergencies,</b> <b>Guard</b> units may be brought under federal control. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard and Reserve units support USARSO's many multilateral exercises and programs. It is through this integration of the Active Army, National Guard, and Reserves that US Army South USARSO can maximize resources to carry its missions.|$|R

Typical of this class of mechanosensitive channel are the large conduction homopentameric bacterial channel, MscL (MW∼ 17 kDa) and the small conduction homoheptameric bacterial channel, MscS (∼ 37 kDa) ...|$|R
50|$|During {{its time}} in Malaya, the 2nd Battalion {{performed}} {{a variety of}} duties, including, in their involvement in the <b>Emergency,</b> <b>guarding</b> duties due to the Malayan Police's manpower problems, but also performed more aggressive tasks, such as patrolling into the dense jungle, hunting for CT. The patrols were difficult for the Commonwealth forces, {{who did not know}} where the CT lurked, and who had to contend with all the many aspects of the jungle, such as the diverse animals and sounds that make the jungle their home (especially leeches), and the claustrophobia of such a place, with the soldiers having probably been accustomed to living in relatively wide-open cities. A very apparent danger was the deadly booby traps laid by the CT. Patrols at times, despite hard slogging in the energy-sapping jungle, gave very little to show for the hard-work, but when contact was made with the CT, it invariably ended in fierce, close-quarters combat, with much valour and professionalism often displayed by the battalion. In 1948, the Scots Guards were involved in the Batang Kali massacre. By the time the battalion departed Malaya in 1951 for home. it had lost thirteen officers and other ranks. The Emergency was declared over on 31 July 1960, the Communists had been defeated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Context: Consumer {{tests for}} {{vehicles}} have long {{a tradition of}} almost two decades in Europe to assess vehicular safety abilities. For active safety systems like an <b>emergency</b> braking <b>guard,</b> different consumer-test-organizations (CTOs) around the world intensify now the challenges for automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in terms of specific test protocols. Objective: This work focuses on the systematic generation of possible vehicle trajectories within the allowed tolerance ranges for a simulation environment. It is {{of great interest to}} which extent the different test parameters will affect the brake time-points in each test case as well as the residual velocity in case of a collision with a target vehicle. Method: A formal model using a graph-based representation of the allowed variances based on relevant time-points allows the selection of relevant trajectories as test cases. These trajec-tories are simulated afterwards to investigate its influence on the system’s performance. Results: The systematic approach unveiled varying action points in time of the software of an <b>emergency</b> braking <b>guard,</b> which could influence the overall result of a consumer test. Conclusion: The use of a structured simulative approach for evaluating an active safety system during the development process enables a more focused feedback and supports extensive tests on real proving grounds by systematic and automated robustness analyses for example.

50|$|During the day, {{the guard}} uses the {{traditional}} green flag {{to signal the}} pilot to depart, and the red flag to stop, assisted by two-way radios. After sunset, the guard uses lamp signals {{in place of the}} flags. A couple of minutes before signalling departure to the pilot, the guard blows a whistle to warn passengers to board the train. After ensuring all passengers are safe to travel, the guard signals the green flag by waving it from the brake van. In an <b>emergency,</b> the <b>guard</b> uses the red flag to indicate a stop, and may directly apply brakes to stop the train. The pilot is not allowed to move the train without a signal from the guard, as the guard {{is in charge of the}} train.|$|R

50|$|The Massachusetts State Defense Force (MSDF) is the State Defense Force of {{the state}} of Massachusetts. The purpose of the Massachusetts State Defense Force is to augment the Massachusetts National <b>Guard</b> during <b>emergencies</b> in the state, {{especially}} when {{some or all of the}} National Guard is deployed. The MSDF is an all-volunteer state military force which reports directly to the State Adjutant General and is under the command of the Governor of Massachusetts. Like the National Guard, members have regular civilian careers and only meet for drills one weekend per month unless activated by the Governor during an <b>emergency.</b> The <b>guard</b> is headquartered at Milford, Massachusetts, in the same building as the National Guard. The director of the guard is appointed by The Adjutant General of Massachusetts (TAGMA). The Massachusetts State Defense Force is authorized by both the Constitution of Massachusetts and chapter 33 § 10 of the Massachusetts General Laws.|$|R

50|$|A further {{purpose for}} these side lamps was that, {{as the red}} {{indication}} was provided by a shade that could be removed by sliding {{out of the top}} of the lamp, a white light could be shown {{to the rear of the}} train. This could be used to indicate to a train on a parallel faster line that the brake van showing the white light was travelling in the same direction but on another line, presenting no danger of a collision. The white lamp would be on the side closest to the faster running line, and would be deployed on relief or slow lines where faster running lines ran parallel with no more than one other line intervening, or on loops or refuge sidings next to running lines. In an <b>emergency,</b> the <b>guard</b> could attract the attention of other railway staff by reversing these side lights, so that red lights shone forward to alert the loco crew, or any other railway staff that saw them.|$|R

50|$|A uniform {{is a type}} of {{clothing}} worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity. Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, <b>emergency</b> services, security <b>guards,</b> in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in prisons. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects. For some public groups, such as police, it is illegal for non members to wear the uniform. Other uniforms are trade dresses (such as the brown uniforms of UPS).|$|R

50|$|A {{quality system}} may guide {{the safety of}} a tram system. A tram system may have a control centre {{following}} the trams, having radio contact with the drivers, and ability to contact and guide <b>guards,</b> <b>emergency</b> dispatch centre, or repair patrols. A tram typically carries first aid kit, a radio and/or a phone, some tools, and a fire extinguisher. Basic first aid, prodromic driving manners, safety courses, and protocols to follow in an accident are taught to tram drivers. Some organizations may test the drivers for alcohol and/or drugs regularly, occasionally, and/or in case of suspicion to avoid driving under the influence. Also the health of the drivers can be assessed regularly or in case of need. Some organizations can also give education to drivers and re-evaluate their skills and manners regularly. Also rescue organizations can be informed on tram structures, electricity, risks, and specific rescue and firefighting tactics concerning trams. Rescue organizations can also train with trams in simulated accident and firefighting situations.|$|R

40|$|In {{overloaded}} or partially broken (i. e., non-operational) cellular networks, it {{is imperative}} to enable communication within the crowd to allow the management of emergency and crisis situations. To this end, a variety of emerging short-range communication technologies available on smartphones, such as, Wi-Fi Direct, 3 G/LTE direct or Bluetooth/BLE, are able to enable users nowadays to shape point-to-point communication among them. These technologies, however, do not support the formation of overlay networks {{that can be used to}} gather and transmit emergency response state (e. g., transfer the location of trapped people to nearby people or the <b>emergency</b> response <b>guard.)</b> In this paper, we develop techniques that generate the k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) overlay graph of an arbitrary crowd that interconnects over some short-range communication technology. Enabling a kNN overlay graph allows the crowd to connect to its geographically closest peers, those that can physically interact with the user and respond to an emergency crowdsourcing task, such as seeing/sensing similar things as the user (e. g., collect videos and photos). It further allows for intelligent synthesis and mining of heterogeneous data based on the computed kNN graph of the crowd to extract valuable real-time information. We particularly present two efficient algorithms, namely Akin+ and Prox+, which are optimized to work on a resource-limited mobile device. We use Rayzit, a real-world crowd messaging framework we develop, as an example that operates on a kNN graph to motivate and evaluate our work. We use mobility traces collected from three sources for evaluation. The results show that Akin+ and Prox+ significantly outperform existing algorithms in efficiency, even under a skewed distribution of users. 1...|$|R
