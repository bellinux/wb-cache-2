40|$|A {{microbiological}} {{screening method}} (three-plate) {{for the detection}} of the antimicrobial growth promoters tylosin, spiramycin, virginiamycin, zinc bacitracin, and avoparcin in animal feed has been developed and validated successfully. A collaborative study involving 18 laboratories receiving 172 samples was carried out to verify the performance characteristics. The detection level for tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin, expressed in microbiological activity, was 1 mg kg- 1 (<b>false-positives,</b> 2 %; false-negatives, 3, 0, and 6 %, respectively). Avoparcin could be detected at 1 mg kg- 1 in feed in general (<b>false-positives,</b> 2 %; false-negatives, 0 %). However, in calf feed the sensitivity was lower. The percentages of false-negatives were found to be 12 %, 7 %, and 0 % at 1, 3, and 5 mg kg- 1, respectively (<b>false-positives,</b> 4 %). The limit of detection for zinc bacitracin was 3 - 5 mg kg- 1 (<b>false-positives,</b> 5 - 10 %; false-negatives, 77 % at 1 mg kg- 1, 45 % at 2 mg kg- 1, 12 % at 3 mg kg- 1, and 4 % at 5 mg kg- 1). The method allowed for a distinction to be made between the groups of antibiotics: avoparcin/zinc bacitracin versus tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin.

Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a <b>false-positive</b> Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E

We hypothesized that an additional counter-selectable marker in Janus would decrease the revertant frequency and reduce <b>false-positives,</b> since simultaneous reversion of both counter-selectable makers is much less likely. Here we report a modified cassette, Sweet Janus (SJ), in which the sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis conferring sucrose sensitivity is added to Janus.

Accordingly, the frequency of <b>false-positives</b> in the SJ-mediated negative selection was about 100 -fold lower than what was seen for Janus. Thus, SJ enhances negative selection stringency and can accelerate allelic replacement in pneumococcus, especially when transformation frequency is low due to strain background or suboptimal transformation conditions.
