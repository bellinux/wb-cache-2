40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of tailings density and settlement {{are critical for}} successful design, operation, and closure of tailings storage facilities (TSFs). Limitations of the computational methods employed to determine these quantities are often overlooked, leading to inaccurate results and potentially inadequate engineering designs. This paper provides a brief discussion of the methods that are commonly used to model tailings consolidation, discusses relative accuracy of these methods, and outlines common pitfalls encountered in their use. Engineering {{estimates of}} the commonly encountered errors are presented for selected methods. Applicability of various methods and specific recommendations are discussed with regard to TSF geometries, tailings properties, filling rates, and the calculation accuracy requirements. The present study compares traditional small strain and large-strain consolidation analyses, and evaluates differences between one-dimensional and three-dimensional calculation approaches. Also, a comparison between <b>estimated</b> (<b>calculated)</b> and actual tailings densities (based on mill production data and bathymetric surveys) is provided for an existing operational tailings facility...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the interpretation of}} uranium (U) ore-mineral equilibrium calculations in groundwater to help understand ore genesis and assist exploration. Groundwater samples collected on two recent field sampling trips in the Frome Embayment region of South Australia have been analysed for major and selected trace elements. These data together with previous published data {{have been used to}} construct geochemical models of the equilibrium state of the groundwaters. Species' activities and mineral saturation states have been <b>estimated.</b> <b>Calculated</b> species' activities are generally in the range reported in the previous modelling by Giblin involving groundwaters from similar local sources. Our models indicate that amorphous UO 2, rather than the ore minerals coffinite and uraninite, is the solid U mineral phase that is the likely control on groundwater U concentration. The UO 2 (am saturation index did not show a systematic variation with ore grade or proximity to mineralization. Its use for exploration at smaller scales, where the groundwater composition is similar between sample sites and U minerals are present at various concentrations, is doubtful. Inherent limitations on the information provided by mineral saturation indices restrict their exploration application, particularly in high salinity palaeochannel groundwater environments, such as those common in Australia. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to quantitatively analyze the {{dispersion}} ability of different methods for the preparation of vapor grown carbon nanofiber - epoxy composites. Four different dispersion methods were used, differing in stress level intensity: blender mixing, capillary rheometry mixing, 3 roll milling and planetary centrifuge mixing. Furthermore, the relationship between dispersion and DC conductivity of the composites was evaluated. For the dispersion analysis, four nanofiber concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 3. 0 wt. % were prepared for each method, while the DC measurements were performed for eight concentrations, ranging from 0. 0 to 4. 0 wt. %. The dispersion was analyzed by transmitted light optical microscopy and greyscale analysis, following a methodology previously established. The results show that as the VGCNF content increases the dispersion level decreases, {{as indicated by the}} increase of the variance of the corresponding greyscale histograms. The 3 roll-mill method produces the samples with the highest dispersion levels, whilst the samples from the remaining methods show large VGCNF agglomerates. The dispersion was also <b>estimated</b> <b>calculated</b> {{along the length of the}} samples, indicating a symmetric variation of dispersion from the center. The dispersion method also strongly influences the overall composite electrical response. No relationship was found between the electrical conductivity and the greyscale analysis achieved by the different methods. Thus, this method for the quantification of dispersion works well for lengthscales around 0. 1 μm, but this is above the relevant scale that determines the electrical response...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: During {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB), systemic coagulation {{is believed}} to become activated by blood contact with the extracorporeal circuit and by retransfusion of pericardial blood. To which extent retransfusion activates systemic coagulation, however, is unknown. We investigated to which extent retransfusion of pericardial blood triggers systemic coagulation during CPB. METHODS: Thirteen patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were included. Pericardial blood was retransfused into nine patients and retained in four patients. Systemic samples were collected before, during and after CPB, and pericardial samples before retransfusion. Levels of prothrombin fragment F(1 + 2) (ELISA), microparticles (flow cytometry) and non-cell bound (soluble) tissue factor (sTF; ELISA) were determined. RESULTS: Compared to systemic blood, pericardial blood contained elevated levels of F(1 + 2), microparticles and sTF. During CPB, systemic levels of F(1 + 2) increased from 0. 28 (0. 25 - 0. 37; median, interquartile range) to 1. 10 (0. 49 - 1. 55) nmol/l (p= 0. 001). This observed increase {{was similar to the}} <b>estimated</b> (<b>calculated)</b> increase (p= 0. 424), and differed significantly between retransfused and non-retransfused patients (1. 12 nmol/l vs 0. 02 nmol/l, p= 0. 001). Also, the observed systemic increases of platelet- and erythrocyte-derived microparticles and sTF were in line with predicted increases (p= 0. 868, p= 0. 778 and p= 0. 205, respectively). Before neutralization of heparin, microparticles and other coagulant phospholipids decreased from 464 microg/ml (287 - 701) to 163 microg/ml (121 - 389) in retransfused patients (p= 0. 001), indicating rapid clearance after retransfusion. CONCLUSION: Retransfusion of pericardial blood does not activate systemic coagulation under heparinization. The observed increases in systemic levels of F(1 + 2), microparticles and sTF during CPB are explained by dilution of retransfused pericardial bloo...|$|E

40|$|Lions have {{recently}} been introduced {{to a number of}} small (120 kg), adult (41 %) and male (39 %) and the five most commonly killed species (kudu, black wildebeest, warthog, bushbuck and Blesbuck) comprised 67. 9 % of all kills and 67. 8 % of total biomass consumed. In an attempt to overcome the problem of gaps in the kill lists, a subset of data, which excluded kills more than five days apart, was analyzed and this gave similar results to analysis of the full kill lists. Mean daily intake rates varied annually between 2. 26 and 5. 23 kg. FEQ⁻¹ for the full data set and 4. 53 and 1 0. 46 kg. FEQ⁻¹ for the subset. The difference between <b>estimated</b> (<b>calculated</b> using daily intake rates of 5 and 7. 12 kg. FEQ⁻¹) and observed offtake for each ungulate species reflected the preference ratings for that species. Analysis of bone marrow indicated that: lions killed ungulates in moderate to good condition; condition of culled animals was lower than that of kills; distal bones could be used in analyses; and that that bones exposed to the environment for at least a week could be used to analyze condition of prey. Home ranges and activity centers ranged from 21. 42 km² to 73. 27 km² and 2. 7 lkm² to 17. 47 km² respectively, which was smaller than expected from previous studies. Although, lions at K wandwe and Shan 1 wari preferred different vegetation types, at both reserves they generally occupied areas that were structurally similar to what has previously been reported. Continuous monitoring and analyses of diet, including condition of the prey, and habitat use will provide reserve managers with some of the necessary information to enable them to effectively manage their lion populations and to predict and minimize potential problems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGaining a {{detailed}} {{understanding of the}} energetics of the proton pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) {{is one of the}} challenges of modern biophysics. Although there are several current mechanistic proposals, most of these ideas have not been subjected to consistent structure–function considerations. In particular most works have not related the activation barriers for different mechanistic proposals to the protein structure. The present work describes a general approach for exploring the energetics of different feasible models of the action of CcO, using the observed protein structure, established simulation methods and a modified Marcus' formulation. We start by reviewing our methods for evaluation of the energy diagrams for different proton translocation paths and then present a systematic analysis of various constraints that should be imposed on any energy diagram for the pumping process. After the general analysis we turn to the actual computational study, where we construct energy diagrams for forward and backward paths, using the <b>estimated</b> <b>calculated</b> reduction potentials and pKa values of all the relevant sites (including internal water molecules). We then explore the relationship between the calculated energy diagrams and key experimental constraints. This comparison allows us to identify some barriers that are not fully consistent with the overall requirement for an efficient pumping. In particular we identify back leakage channels, which are hard to block without stopping the forward channels. This helps to identify open problems that will require further experimental and theoretical studies. We also consider reasonable adjustments of the calculated barriers that may lead to a working pump. Although the present analysis does not establish a unique and workable model for the mechanism of CcO, it presents what is probably the most consistent current analysis of the barriers for different feasible pathways. Perhaps more importantly, the framework developed here should provide a general way for examining any proposal for the action of CcO {{as well as for the}} analysis of further experimental findings about the action of this fascinating system...|$|E
