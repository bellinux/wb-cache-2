5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1986, the accused, {{a career}} {{criminal}} named Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport. He had imported at least seventy grams of heroin, which he concealed within condoms that he <b>had</b> <b>swallowed.</b> He was arrested {{the next morning}} by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen, and some heroin {{in a plastic bag}} under a hirug in another room. He was taken into custody, and passed the remainder of the condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison. Dietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police.|$|E
5|$|Two male {{passengers}} were arrested at North Shore Hospital after a nurse informed police that 46-year-old Antonio Zuluaga <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> containers filled with cocaine. Zuluaga, {{who had a}} fractured spine, broken ribs and a dislocated hip, was the second passenger {{to be found in}} possession of cocaine packages, after doctors operating on Jose Figueroa on the day after the crash to stop internal bleeding had also discovered packets of cocaine.They pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. Figueroa was sentenced to seven years to life in prison, and Zuluaga was sentenced to six years to life.|$|E

5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
25|$|The next day, an {{ambulance}} was called and Peter {{was found in}} his cot, blue and clad only in a nappy. After attempts at resuscitation, {{he was taken to}} North Middlesex Hospital with his mother but was pronounced dead at 12:20 pm. A post-mortem revealed he <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> a tooth after being punched. Other injuries included a broken back, broken ribs, mutilated fingertips and missing fingernails.|$|E
25|$|Isis and {{her sister}} Nephthys went looking for these pieces, but could only find {{thirteen}} of the fourteen. Fish <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> the last piece, his phallus. With Thoth's help she created a golden phallus, and attached it to Osiris’s body. She then transformed into a kite, and {{with the aid of}} Thoth’s magic conceived Horus the Younger. The number of pieces is described on temple walls variously as fourteen and sixteen, one for each nome or district.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack, Piper {{ran into a}} local café, where an {{ambulance}} was called. Crews had to wait an hour before being able to treat Piper, {{because of the risk}} presented by the acid, which was still unidentified at that point, and because Sylvestre could still have been nearby. Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where her treatment was led by Dr. Mohammad Ali Jawad. The acid, some of which Piper <b>had</b> <b>swallowed,</b> blinded her in her left eye, and caused partial thickness and full thickness burns. The surgeons completely removed the skin of Piper's face, and replaced it with a skin substitute, Matriderm, to build the foundations for a skin graft. This procedure was {{the first of its kind}} to be done in a single operation.|$|E
25|$|Lehto {{was back}} for the San Marino Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris would be the second driver at Jordan. However, the weekend {{got off to a}} bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during {{practice}} and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a tyre wall, which almost instantly stopped the car's forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> his tongue and his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would be back at the circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a fractured nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.|$|E
500|$|Small, benthic {{bony fishes}} {{constitute}} over 90% of the marbled electric ray's diet by weight; these include gobies, hake, sea bass, mullets, jack mackerel, sea breams, goatfish, damselfish, wrasses, conger eels, and flatfish. Cephalopods such as European squid (Loligo vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs. Off southern France, {{by far the most}} important prey species is the leaping mullet (Liza saliens). Food items are swallowed whole; there is a record of a ray [...] long that had consumed a three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) [...] long.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1916, Tristan Tzara took {{distance}} from the Italian Futurists, rejecting the militarist and proto-fascist stance of their leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism {{as the leader of}} modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated." [...] Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Alberto Savinio, painters Gino Cantarelli and Aldo Fiozzi, as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists. Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist Julius Evola, who became a personal friend of Tzara.|$|E
500|$|The diet of {{the coffin}} ray {{consists}} mostly of benthic bony fishes, but also includes cephalopods and on occasion crustaceans and polychaete worms. Penguins and rats {{have also been}} recorded from the stomachs of this species. The coffin ray ambushes prey from the substrate, and swallows them whole head-first before re-burying. It often takes extremely large prey relative to its size; one observed individual [...] long <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> a flathead (Platycephalus sp.) [...] long, and {{the tail of the}} prey fish was still protruding from its mouth. Dead specimens have been recovered that had apparently choked trying to swallow too-large prey. The coffin ray is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother. Females give birth to litters of 4–8 pups in summer; the newborns measure approximately [...] long. Males and females both attain sexual maturity around [...] long. This species is known to be parasitized by the tapeworms Acanthobothrium angelae and Lacistorhynchus dollfusi, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E

2500|$|Stein was beatified as {{a martyr}} on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Vatican City. The miracle {{that was the}} basis for her canonization was the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> a large amount of {{paracetamol}} (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl's father, Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for St. Teresa's intercession. Shortly thereafter the nurses {{in the intensive care unit}} saw her sit up completely healthy. Dr. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: [...] "I was willing to say that it was miraculous." [...] McCarthy would later attend St. Teresa's canonization.|$|E

2500|$|An {{essential}} {{contribution of}} his was creating a political avatar of a Junimist cultural metaphor, that of [...] "forms without content"—namely, {{the belief that}} Romanian society <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> up modern ideas without adapting them to its backward realities. Carp welcomed Westernization as a basic requirement, but argued that its import of [...] "forms" [...] had rendered politicians unwilling to address the [...] "content". He once noted: [...] "For some, science is all that which has seen print. They discovered, already black on white, the ideas of some author, picked up his ideas, without ever considering whether the theory agrees with the practice, whether the difficulties of accomplishing it are subject to abstract aspirations". The wholesale modernizers, he stated, were [...] "planting flowers into sandy soil" [...] or building [...] "a castle on sands". In order to elevate the [...] "content", Carp suggested a slow build-up of civic consciousness and a steady increase of the middle class.|$|E

And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all [...] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.|$|E
2500|$|Chatfield is {{also noted}} for being seriously injured on the cricket field, in a Test match against England in the 1974/5 season. England {{were at the}} end of a long and {{difficult}} tour in which they had been defeated in the Ashes by Australia, chiefly by the Australian fast bowlers Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. Chatfield, a number 11 batsman, was holding up England with a last wicket partnership with his future captain, Geoff Howarth. English fast bowler Peter Lever decided to test Chatfield with a bouncer. At the time helmets and other now common protective gear were not in use. The ball struck Chatfield on the temple, rendering him unconscious and not breathing. Watching English physiotherapist Bernard Thomas was the first to realise what had happened: Chatfield <b>had</b> <b>swallowed</b> his tongue. He flicked it back into place (and managed to revive Chatfield with a heart massage. Lever was distraught and Chatfield later joked that when he was visited by Lever in hospital, that [...] "he looked worse than I did". A couple of years later helmets were introduced into cricket and Chatfield wore one thereafter.|$|E
