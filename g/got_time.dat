5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca <b>got</b> <b>time</b> bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E

Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal {{to more than one}} demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but he was chosen after he <b>got</b> <b>time</b> off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The Hit Man and Her. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.|$|E
