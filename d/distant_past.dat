For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the <b>distant</b> <b>past,</b> as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the <b>distant</b> <b>past</b> in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, {{particularly}} Germany and England, memorials used {{a medieval}} style, reaching {{back to a}} more <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> Some of these medieval styled memorials were set in existing medieval buildings, fusing older and newer themes. Memorial church windows, for example, could combine medieval and modern features, including armoured knights on horseback, modern weapons-including-tanks and aircraft-and modern national flags. Other memorials deliberately chose medieval themes and symbols, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster, where {{the language of the}} inscriptions was deliberately archaic, and the tomb itself made from a medieval chest, decorated with a crusader's sword. England's patron saint, Saint George, was a particular popular symbol in British designs, typically shown mounted and wearing armour. The Arthurian Round Table and the medieval crusades proved popular themes in Canadian memorials.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' {{offensive}} woes {{seemed in}} the <b>distant</b> <b>past</b> as the lineup {{broke out in}} a big way during Game 4. Led by Ryan Howard's 3-for-4, 2 home run performance, and home runs by Jayson Werth and starting pitcher Joe Blanton, the Phillies pushed 10 runs across the plate. Blanton became the first World Series pitcher to hit a home run in 34 years, in addition to a strong performance on the mound, pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs on four hits. Roster addition Eric Hinske hit a home run for the Rays, as did left fielder Carl Crawford, his second of the series.|$|E
5|$|There are {{approximately}} 460 globular clusters {{associated with the}} Andromeda Galaxy. The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular One, has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies. It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Globular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which {{is located in the}} south-west arm's eastern half.|$|E

5|$|While {{exploring}} this period, Raziel discovers {{evidence that}} two ancient races waged war in Nosgoth's <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> One race created the Pillars to banish their adversaries, but the enemy race—the Hylden—retaliated with a curse which transformed the Pillars' architects {{into the first}} vampires. Kain explains that, had he sacrificed himself, the vampire race—the rightful inheritors of the Pillars—would have become extinct. Raziel chooses to spare Kain, causing a paradox; history reshuffles itself to accommodate the extension of Kain's life. He, however, refuses to indulge Kain's plans any further, instead opting to explore his own past. Vorador tells Raziel that {{the last of the}} ancient vampires, Janos Audron, held the key to Raziel's destiny, but Janos was murdered by the Sarafan five centuries ago.|$|E
5|$|With a {{fight about}} to break out over Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) body {{following}} his assassination, the Wildlings arrive at Castle Black and force Alliser Thorne (Owen Teale) and his allies to surrender, allowing Melisandre (Carice van Houten) to resurrect Jon. At Winterfell, news of a son being born to Walda Frey (Elizabeth Webster) leads Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) to murder his father Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton), {{as well as his}} step-mother and newborn brother. Across the Narrow Sea, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) unchains the dragons being held in the catacombs of Meereen, and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) proceeds to the next step in her training in Braavos. Meanwhile, beyond the Wall, Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) experiences visions of his home, Winterfell, in the <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1923 J Harlen Bretz {{published}} a paper {{arguing that the}} channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> This view, which was seen as arguing for a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, setting off a forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|E

5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the <b>distant</b> <b>past</b> the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the <b>distant</b> <b>past</b> have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Griffiths {{sought a}} {{historical}} origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, {{to account for}} it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so {{it is possible that}} the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.|$|E
25|$|In the pre-Hispanic past, {{important}} divinatory dates {{relating to}} the prospects of the entire kingdom were sometimes given a mythological pedigree.

40|$|In 1992, American {{linguist}} Johanna Nichols {{introduced a}} new method of detecting typological patterns at great time depths, based on the morphological analysis and cross-linguistic comparisons of several structural types and grammatical categories (Nichols 1992). She claimed that her method reveals patterns that may go {{back as far as}} the initial modern human colonization of the globe, and she set up a preliminary model of early linguistic spread. Has Nichols taken a ground-breaking step towards a greater understanding of our <b>distant</b> linguistic <b>past?</b> And how can we test this? Towards the end of her book, Nichols 1992 : 263 - 65 calls for an analysis of ‘critical’ languages which are {{in a unique position to}} fill the gaps in her study and thus essential to our understanding of global linguistic prehistory. Using Nichols’ method as a testing model, this article highlights one such critical language group – the Andamanese language family, spoken by the indigenous Negrito population on the Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal – in an effort to shed further light on the <b>distant</b> linguistic <b>past</b> of our species...|$|R
5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the <b>distant</b> <b>past.</b> Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the <b>distant</b> <b>past,</b> and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how urban space in Cheju City can be imagined {{as a site}} of experience and identity. The rapid development of Cheju City on Cheju Island, the Republic of Korea’s prime resort and ecological heritage destination, has foregrounded tensions between global tourism and local identity. How people experience cities physically has an intimate connection with how they imagine and represent urban space. Cheju City, which has transformed from being the modest seat of a long-marginalized periphery into a burgeoning tourism hub, is a battleground on which differing visions of urban space as the location of culture are staged. Such debates are {{as much about the}} right to represent identity as about the right to use urban space. While urban redevelopment in Cheju City erases entire city blocks for tourist facilities and elaborate monuments to <b>distant</b> <b>pasts,</b> emergent social movements are rearticulating sites of memory to recover a sense of a Cheju-specific landscape and to redefine local identity. Using ongoing ethnographic and archival research conducted since 2012, this article demonstrates how a new urban heritage paradigm is emerging in Cheju. Heritage is no longer confined to essentialist conclusions drawn from rural folklore but now directly addresses urban experience...|$|R
