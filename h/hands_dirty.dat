Examples are the use of mercenaries to perform the work that the Culture does not want to get their <b>hands</b> <b>dirty</b> with, and even outright threats of invasion (the Culture has issued ultimatums to other civilizations before). Some commentators have also argued that those SC agents tasked with civilising foreign cultures (and thus potentially also changing them into a blander, more Culture-like state) are also those most likely to regret these changes, with parallels drawn to real-world special forces trained to operate within the cultural mindsets of foreign nations.|$|E

Ball was a main (but not the only) financer of the defeat of Claude Pepper's effort to be reelected to the United States Senate in 1950.

5000|$|Though the {{discourse}} on <b>dirty</b> <b>hands</b> goes {{back as far}} as Machiavelli, contemporary philosophical interest in the problem of <b>dirty</b> <b>hands</b> had been revitalized by the works of American political theorist Michael Walzer and other thinkers. The term itself comes from Jean-Paul Sartre's 1948 play <b>Dirty</b> <b>Hands,</b> in which Hoederer speaks of having <b>dirty</b> <b>hands</b> up to his elbows, then asks, [...] "But what do you hope?

The dirty hands [...] represent the shared guilt. No one is completely clean, in the end we are all accomplices". In keeping with her increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and messy and filled it up with little colorful braids, looking like a [...] "modern Medusa" [...] according to biographer Ximena Diego. Following the album's commercial success, girls from several countries were copying Shakira's style, colorfully braiding their hair and wearing friendship bracelets.|$|E

500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and {{sacrifice}} fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute {{their fair share}} to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him {{a great deal of}} money and Cutter's friendship, while providing him with a collection of his own suicide victims; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. [...] Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through class warfare: Borden as The Professor, a working-class magician who gets his <b>hands</b> <b>dirty,</b> versus Angier as The Great Danton, a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American. Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician as good or evil.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its <b>hands</b> <b>dirty.</b> The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your <b>hands</b> <b>dirty.</b> No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E

The first {{synchronized}} speech, uttered by Jack to a cabaret crowd and to the piano player in the band that accompanies him, occurs directly after that performance, beginning at the 17:25 mark of the film. Jack's first spoken words—"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet"—were well-established stage patter of Jolson's. He had even spoken very similar lines in a 1926 short, Al Jolson in [...] "A Plantation Act." [...] The line had developed as something of an in-joke. In November 1918, during a gala concert celebrating the end of World War I, Jolson ran onstage amid the applause for the preceding performer, the great operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, and exclaimed, [...] "Folks, you ain't heard nothin' yet." [...] The following year, he recorded the song [...] "You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet". In a later scene, Jack talks with his mother, played by Eugenie Besserer, in the family parlor; his father enters and pronounces one very conclusive word.|$|E

Yet it has always been difcult to translate the powerful dramatic image of <b>dirty</b> <b>hands</b> into a coherent account of a philosophical problem. Many Anglo-American philosophers have argued that such an account is impossible. In Dawn, however, Elie Wiesel resolves the relevant paradoxes by imaginatively exploiting the religious consciousness of the novel's main protagonist.

[...] The only way, in her mind, to secure the royal family's hold on the Queendom was to prolong the war such that the nobility would be completely and utterly ruined.
