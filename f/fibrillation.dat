5|$|File:Digoxin.svg|Digoxin is used {{to treat}} atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> atrial flutter and {{sometimes}} heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{therapy has}} also been {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of peripheral vasculature stenosis and considered for the treatment of atrial <b>fibrillation.</b>|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Anoaʻi {{was hospitalized}} due to {{congestive}} heart failure (with {{which he had been}} diagnosed years earlier) and atrial <b>fibrillation.</b> He died on April 17, 2017, 10 days after his 47th birthday, in Pensacola, Florida, due to {{congestive heart failure}} related to his weight problem.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2007, Cheney {{was treated}} for deep-vein {{thrombosis}} in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed {{him to return to}} work. CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and underwent treatment that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|While {{giving a}} speech at Lexington Community College on October 10, 2003, Breathitt {{collapsed}} due to ventricular <b>fibrillation.</b> He was resuscitated and admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital but remained comatose and died on October 14. He was buried at the Riverside Cemetery in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. In 2000, the Pennyrile Parkway in western Kentucky was renamed the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, <b>fibrillation</b> of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial <b>fibrillation),</b> immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|LeHand {{was born}} in Potsdam, New York, to DanielJ. and MaryJ. (née Graffin) LeHand, who were the {{children}} of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, {{when they were in}} their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left her delicate and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial <b>fibrillation</b> he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial <b>fibrillation</b> due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
25|$|While loss-of-function {{mutations}} in KCNE1 cause Long QT syndrome, gain-of-function KCNE1 mutations {{are associated with}} early-onset atrial <b>fibrillation.</b> A common KCNE1 polymorphism, S38G, is associated with altered predisposition to lone atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and postoperative atrial <b>fibrillation.</b> Atrial KCNE1 expression was downregulated in a porcine model of post-operative atrial <b>fibrillation</b> following lung lobectomy.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{enlargement}} {{of both the}} left and right atria is associated with long-standing atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and, if noted at the initial presentation of atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> suggests that the atrial <b>fibrillation</b> is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> most {{commonly}} occurs within diseased hearts, and, {{in the vast}} majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. Ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with electrolyte imbalance, overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs, and following near drowning or major trauma. It is also notable that ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic ventricular <b>fibrillation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Limited {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that screening for atrial <b>fibrillation</b> in those 65 years and older increases the number of cases of atrial <b>fibrillation</b> detected.|$|E
25|$|Those with atrial <b>fibrillation</b> have a 5% a year risk of stroke, {{and this}} risk {{is higher in}} those with valvular atrial <b>fibrillation.</b> Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with {{medications}} such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention. Except in people with atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention —any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic {{ventricular}} <b>fibrillation</b> {{occurs with}} a reputed incidence of approximately 1% {{of all cases}} of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3%-9% of the cases of ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> resuscitations in patients {{under the age of}} 40. It follows then that, {{on the basis of the}} fact that ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> itself is common, idiopathic ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the Brugada Syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.|$|E
25|$|People with atrial <b>fibrillation</b> {{and rapid}} {{ventricular}} response are often treated with amiodarone or procainamide to stabilize their heart rate. Procainamide and cardioversion are now accepted treatments for conversion of tachycardia found with WPW. Amiodarone was previously {{thought to be}} safe in atrial <b>fibrillation</b> with WPW, but after several cases of ventricular <b>fibrillation,</b> {{it is no longer}} recommended in this clinical scenario.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> (V-fib or VF) is {{when the}} heart quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized {{electrical}} activity in the ventricles. It {{is a type of}} cardiac arrhythmia. Ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular <b>fibrillation.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} with WPW {{experiences}} episodes of atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|In general, an {{extended}} evaluation {{is not necessary}} for most individuals with atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and is performed only if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the atrial <b>fibrillation</b> is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.|$|E
25|$|Tikosyn (dofetilide) for atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and flutter.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative atrial <b>fibrillation</b> and atrial flutter.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} new cases each year of atrial <b>fibrillation</b> {{increases}} with age. In individuals {{over the age of}} 80 it affects about 8%. In developed countries, the number of patients with atrial <b>fibrillation</b> is likely to increase during the next 50years, owing to the growing proportion of elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> {{to a more}} benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals. Defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.|$|E
25|$|Keeping blood {{pressure}} below 140/90 mmHg is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular atrial <b>fibrillation,</b> anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke. Stroke prevention treatment for atrial <b>fibrillation</b> is determined {{according to the}} CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial <b>fibrillation</b> is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.|$|E
