The scene of the pedant's dinner after the manner of the ancients, does not seem to myself so comic as the adventures of Trunnion, while the bride is at the altar, and the bridegroom is tacking and veering with his convoy about the fields. One sees how the dinner is done: with a knowledge of Athenaeus, Juvenal, Petronius, and Horace, many men could have written this set piece. But Trunnion is quite inimitable: he is a child of humour and of the highest spirits, like Mr. Weller the elder. Till Scott created Mause <b>Headrig,</b> no Caledonian had ever produced anything except [...] "Tam o' Shanter," [...] that could be a pendant to Trunnion. His pathos is possibly just a trifle overdone, though that is not my own opinion. Dear Trunnion! he makes me overlook the gambols of his detestable protege, the hero.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{problems}} of hardwood timber availability have caused many sawmiller, industry analysts, and planners {{to recognize the}} importance of sawmill conversion efficiency. Conversion efficiency not only affects sawmill profits, but is also important on a much broader level. Timber supply issues have caused resource planners and policy makers to consider the effects of conversion efficiency on the utilization and depletion of the timber resource. Improvements in sawmill conversion efficiency would favorably impact sawmill profits, and would be equivalent in effect to extending existing supplies of standing timber. An equation was developed to estimate lumber recovery factor for hardwood sawmills based on the characteristics of sawing machines and log resources. Variables included in the model were <b>headrig</b> type, <b>headrig</b> kerf, average log diameter and length, and the influence of total sawing variation. The estimated coefficients significantly influenced lumber recovery factor. The model should be helpful in assessing conversion efficiency trends and potential benefits from gains in sawmill efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{a typical}} sawmill, logs enter the mill {{and go through}} a de-barking process. Following this {{operation}} {{they go to the}} <b>headrig</b> where a sawyer moves the log repeatedly past a saw to remove boards one at a time. As more of the log interior is exposed with each board removed, the sawyer may re-orient the log periodically to cut from the best side. Sawn boards go through subsequent operations of edging and trimming, where defects near the edges and/or ends of the boards are removed to increase each board’s grade, and therefore its value. The cant (the cubical center section of the log) remaining from initial breakdown enters a resawing operation where additional boards are cut. These are also edged and trimmed...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between annual softwood sawmill production and lumber processing variables was ex-amined {{using data from}} Sawmill Improvement Program (SIP) studies of 650 softwood mills. The variables were lumber recovery factor (LRF); <b>headrig</b> and resaw kerf width; total sawing variation, rough green size, and oversizing-undersizing for 4 / 4 and 8 / 4 lumber; planer allowance; and average log diameter and length. All variables except planer allowance and average log di-ameter were significantly influenced by annual sawmill production. The conversion efficiency of the mills in terms of most of these variables increased as sawmill size increased but decreased at annual production levels approaching or exceeding 100 million board feet. Study sawmills were grouped by geographic region and annual production class. Weighted values of LRF, sawing, and resource variables were calculated for each region by weighting by the percentage of mills of that production class in each category.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 A {{computer}} program, SAW 3 DG, {{was developed}} to optimize log breakdown using 3 -dimensional log and internal defect shapes. The program was based on SAW 3 D, a log breakdown optimization program considering only 3 -dimensional log shape. SAW 3 D was modified to include internal log defects in 3 -dimensional representation and integrated with SLGRADER, an expert system for softwood lumber grading, resulting {{in a system that}} is able to optimize log breakdown based on lumber grade. SAW 3 DG allows live, cant, around, and multi-thickness sawing methods. The system uses a polygonal cross-section model to represent the log and its internal defects. It consists of four basic components: <b>headrig</b> optimization, edging optimization, trimming optimization, and lumber grading. The <b>headrig</b> optimization component begins the log breakdown process by mathematically rotating and skewing the log into a position and then uses a programming (DP) algorithm to find the optimum sawing pattern. The profile of each piece cut from the log along with its defect information is then passed to the edging optimization component where the piece is optimally positioned and then edged using another DP algorithm. Information about the untrimmed lumber and its defects is sent to the trimming optimization component where the sizes of each finished piece of lumber and defects exposed on its four faces are finally determined. This information is then sent to the lumber grading component to determine the lumber grade. Lumber value is determined by its grade and size and used by a third DP algorithm to decide the optimum trimming pattern. Solutions are provided both in text and graphic formats. Twelve computer generated logs of various sizes and in ellipsoid, horn-down, and S-twisted shapes with a number of internal defect types and distributions were used to evaluate SAW 3 DG. Results indicated that SAW 3 DG provided better solutions than those models that consider only the true external log shape or that treat the log as a defect free truncated cone. In addition, effects of log rotation and skewing operations, flitch/cant pitch, and different sawing methods on SAW 3 DG solutions were also studied...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer-based}} {{process information}} system {{was developed to}} gather operational information about the <b>headrig</b> handsaw at the Timber Technology Centre (TiTC) sawmill in the Waiariki Institute of Technology, store the data in a database, and display the information in various forms to the user. The project was {{the first part of}} an encompassing programme to instrument an entire commercial sawmill. This research programme aims to determine which variables are crucial to quantifying the sawing processes and to investigate the best techniques for measuring the variables. The system developed was extremely modular. Both analysis modules and sensor hardware can be added or removed without any need for restarting the system. A client-server architecture using networking communications was used to facilitate this. A central server gathers and stores the data, and individual clients analyse the data and display the information to the user. This enables analysis modules to be added and removed without even restarting the system. An experiment to determine the effect of wood density on the variables measured was used to test the viability of the completed system. The system successfully gathered all of the information required for the experiment and performed 70 % of the data collation and analysis automatically. The remainder was performed using spreadsheets as this was deemed to be the most suitable method. The loosely coupled design of the system allows it to be up-scaled to a mill-wide program easily. Experiments performed to gather information about pivotal process variables are currently being planned, and should be underway as the expansion into other machine stations is being designed...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{in the area of}} optical scanning have made sophisticated equipment such as three-dimensional (3 D) log scanners available to the sawmill industry. In a typical Swedish sawmill, the measurements obtained from the 3 D log scanner placed at the log sorting station is used exclusively for scaling and sorting the sawlogs. In the same way, the information obtained from the 3 D log scanner placed at the saw intake is used exclusively for optimal positioning of the sawlog into the <b>headrig.</b> Meanwhile, large knowledge gaps regarding the flow and the origin of the sawlogs persist in the sawmill's daily routine. For the Swedish sawmills performing presorting of sawlogs, the most critical information gap exists between the log sorting station and the saw intake, where the forest log batch identity disappears, and the logs are mixed according to various sorting criteria. This study attempts to use the data generated by 3 D log scanners together with advanced recognition algorithms to develop a traceability system, marking/reading free, between the log sorting station and the saw intake when working with debarked logs. The originality of the fingerprint approach rests on the hypothesis that logs are separate entities with individual features. Measuring these features with the same type of measuring device at both the log sorting station and at the saw intake and then connecting the data to a common database will permit each individual sawlog to be tracked within the sawmill and will thus make it possible to develop an advanced raw material flow control.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Expert {{systems is}} an area of {{artificial}} intelligence that shows promise {{for a wide variety of}} applications, particularly in solving problems that have always been considered too large and complex for solution by conventional approaches. However, the process of eliciting expertise from an expert, knowledge acquisition, is recognized as the principal bottleneck in expert system development. This research explores the use of simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems. With its capability for allowing experimentation on a model of a real system, computer simulation can be used to search for the best knowledge (strategies, constraints, scenarios, etc.), from among a set of alternatives, that optimizes system performance. Although developing high-level abstractions for decision schema that would be applicable to a large set of problem domains is desirable, it is extremely difficult. The focus of this study is the sawmill industry. A moderately complex and typical sawmill simulation system is modeled and used as a basis for developing a knowledge base to improve the material flow for the sawmill. The system components included in the system model are the bucksaw, debarker, <b>headrig,</b> gangsaw, flitch edger, and resaw. The inputs to the system are raw material mix, order file, product price, and operating times. The expert system's knowledge base is a set of operating policies which relate the constraints and actions in the form of production rules. Factors considered in the knowledge base involve material flow, machine breakdowns, queue capacities, and alternative routings. The methodology of using simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted and rules are generated based on the simulation system performance. The rules are recorded in an initial knowledge base and tested for interaction effects. Every combination of rules in the initial knowledge base is checked for its ability to improve the system performance using analysis of variance. A combination of rules that improves the system performance the best is selected as the final knowledge base...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Sawmills {{are very}} complex systems that involve many {{manufacturing}} processes. The variability of their raw material adds further to this complexity as each log has characteristics that determine its processing path. Therefore, computer simulation {{is a very}} useful technique for analyzing sawmill performance. This thesis describes a simulation computer model of the Warm Springs Forest Products Industries sawmill. This model was implemented to improve general sawmill manufacturing processes {{as well as to}} quantify the effect of adding more small diameter timber into the mill's raw material log mix. The WSFPI sawmill includes two primary process centers, the <b>headrig</b> for processing large logs and the end-dogging log feeding system, or EDLF, for processing smaller logs (less than 17 "). The focus of this study is mainly on the small-log side of the sawmill. For an analysis of the sawmill's large log processing system, see "Using discrete-event simulation to study the influence of log yard sorting on sawmill processing efficiency of small diameter timber" (Pinon 2005). The model was implemented using the Arena discrete-event simulation software package. The influence of log characteristics such as diameter and length was included in the model. The model also included simplifications of the real system to facilitate the mill's simulation. Data was collected for different sawmill Results showed that downtimes had a significant influence on sawmill production. Removing downtimes for the trimmer or the EDLF proved to significantly increase production while the other machines' downtimes had no significant influence on production. Investigations into the effect of increasing the EDLF ' s processing speed were also conducted and showed that for the current log distribution, increasing its speed produced no significant increase in production. However, if more smalldiameter material were processed, a significant increase in production was observed. Increasing the gang edger's speed along with the EDLF's speed was also investigated. A significant increase in production was observed but was limited by the other machine centers that could not process the higher material flow (unscrambler, trimmer, board-edger, and horizontal resaw). Higher percentages of small diameter timber are expected as part of the sawmill's future log supply. Simulation runs were conducted to estimate the production loss due to this change, and they showed a significant decrease in production. Those results suggest that machine center changes would be required to offset the production lost from processing greater amounts of small diameter timber...|$|E
