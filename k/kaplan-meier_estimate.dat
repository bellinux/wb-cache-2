40|$|AbstractObjectivesInverse {{probability}} of treatment weighted <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimates</b> {{have been developed}} to compare two treatments in the presence of confounders in observational studies. Recently, stabilized weights were developed to reduce the influence of extreme inverse {{probability of}} treatment-weighted weights in estimating treatment effects. The objective of this research was to use adjusted <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimates</b> and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests to examine the effect of a treatment that varies over time in an observational study. MethodsWe proposed stabilized weight adjusted <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimates</b> and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests when the treatment was time-varying over the follow-up period. We applied these new methods in examining the effect of an anti-platelet agent, clopidogrel, on subsequent events, including bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death after a drug-eluting stent was implanted into a coronary artery. In this population, clopidogrel use may change over time based on a patient's behavior (e. g., nonadherence) and physicians' recommendations (e. g., end of duration of therapy). Consequently, clopidogrel use was treated as a time-varying variable. ResultsWe demonstrate that 1) the sample sizes at three chosen time points are almost identical in the original and weighted datasets; and 2) the covariates between patients on and off clopidogrel were well balanced after stabilized weights were applied to the original samples. ConclusionsThe stabilized weight-adjusted <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>estimates</b> and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests are useful in presenting and comparing survival functions for time-varying treatments in observational studies while adjusting for known confounders...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reviewed}} and compared the various methods {{available for the}} estimation of survival curves. The experience of the EORTC Data Center is that most trials are designed with {{a small number of}} patients on each arm and that actuarial methods are therefore appropriate. Since in clinical trials one will have available either the date of death or the date the patient was last known te be alive, approximations based on Life Table Methods are unnecessary. Thus the <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>Estimate</b> is routinely used in all survival analyses. The number of patients entered on most studies is usually small enough to permit the calculation of the <b>Kaplan-Meier</b> <b>Estimate</b> at each time of death using a pocket calculator.

When investigating drug persistence, the results from the database were split into two distinct time periods from 1997 to 2001 and from 2002 to 2009 to reflect the available treatment options used. Results: The number of patients with each diagnosis was as follows: POAG 608; OHT 246; NTG 152.
