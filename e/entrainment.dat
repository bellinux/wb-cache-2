5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and <b>entrainment</b> of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further {{over the next few}} days due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry air <b>entrainment.</b> PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the <b>entrainment</b> of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air <b>entrainment,</b> and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast on September1. Due to <b>entrainment</b> of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated {{area of low pressure}} developed about 350mi (560km) east of the Leeward Islands on September8. The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and <b>entrainment</b> of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} as a {{tropical}} storm, the thunderstorm activity around Kristy {{appeared to be}} organizing into hooking bands, and further intensification was considered likely, potentially as strong as 60mph (95km/h). However, the thunderstorm activity decreased markedly on September6, primarily from dry air <b>entrainment,</b> and it weakened to tropical depression status for the last time. In one forecast, Kristy was predicted {{to move into the}} area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, or west of 140°W. However, the depression was unable to maintain organized convection around its center for a few days, and Kristy degenerated into a remnant low on September8. The low turned to the southwest, degenerating into a tropical wave on September9 about 1500miles (2400km) southeast of the island of Hawaii, or about 1600miles (2600km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The remnant disturbance continued westward, and initially Kristy was believed to have developed into Tropical Depression Two-C in the central Pacific Ocean; however, post-season analysis concluded the systems were separate.|$|E
5|$|By September 23, Jeanne {{had begun}} a slow westward motion, with its {{previously}} well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed {{just four days}} prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry air <b>entrainment.</b> However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to become better defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west-northwestward, Karen {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on November 13 {{with a central}} pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). Between November 13 and 14, Karen gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. During this time, Karen finally weakened below Category 5 status as its winds dropped below 251 km/h (156 mph). This {{marked the end of}} its near-record 4.25-day span as a storm of such intensity, second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained Category 5 status for 5.5 days. Over the following days, the typhoon's structure gradually became disorganized, with its eye no longer well-defined by November 15. By this time, Karen began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean. The combination of its rapid movement and <b>entrainment</b> of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17. The remnants of Karen continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air <b>entrainment,</b> limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, the {{previously}} detrimental wind shear began easing, allowing the structure {{to become more}} symmetric. On that day, an eye feature began developing {{in the center of}} Fantala, indicative of strengthening. At 12:00UTC on 12 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to severe tropical storm status, and six hours later, the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, with 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph); rapid strengthening was prevented by the <b>entrainment</b> of nearby dry air, although the core of convection continued to contract. At 06:00UTC on 13 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 130km/h (80mph). By that time, the eye feature persisted, consisting of a warm area within the deepest convection, although the dry air in the region prevented quicker strengthening.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, a weak {{low-pressure}} {{area was}} detected south of Hispaniola. Moving northward, the low became sufficiently organized {{to be classified}} as a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on May 19, southeast of Turks Island. At the time, ship observations indicated that the disturbance had a well-defined cyclonic circulation, with the strongest winds situated in the northern semicircle of the cyclone. Continuing northward, the tropical storm gradually intensified and attained maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) by 0000 UTC on May 22. The Belgian ship M.S. Lubrafol recorded a peripheral barometric pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg); this was the lowest pressure measured {{in connection with the}} storm. The following day, the tropical storm temporarily curved towards the east-southeast before recurving back towards a northeast direction. At the same time, the storm expanded in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. By 1200 UTC, the cyclone completed its extratropical transition, due to the <b>entrainment</b> of colder air. The remnant system persisted until 0600 UTC on May 27.|$|E
5|$|Upon first forming, {{the system}} contended with the <b>entrainment</b> of dry {{air to the}} {{northwest}} of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification. The storm steadily intensified, and early on June 2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760km (470mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned {{to the north and}} northeast, though it resumed a westward track after ridging built {{to the north of the}} storm. With a solid area of intense convection, it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3, and with good outflow the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. A well-defined eye developed in the center of convection, and after moving over a local increase in ocean heat content, Gonu rapidly deepened.|$|E
5|$|While at {{its peak}} strength, Cimaron {{displayed}} two small concentric eyewalls, separated by a few kilometres. The storm later made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200UTC on October29; it {{became one of the}} strongest storms to ever hit the region. Interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening, though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12‑hour crossing. After emerging over the South China Sea on October30, the system initially maintained its west-northwest course. However, the following day, a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon, and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling. During this time, the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) on November2. While executing a tight clockwise loop, increased wind shear and <b>entrainment</b> of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken. With a new ridge becoming established over China, the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track. Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November4 and ultimately dissipated three days later just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{interaction}} with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October11. As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485km (300mi) in diameter. Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west {{in response to a}} dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between the two systems, a strong northeasterly flow developed between them. This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400km (250mi) from Bess's center. During the evening of October12, the combined effects of a winter monsoon and <b>entrainment</b> of cool, dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305km (190mi) south of Hong Kong. The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85km/h (50mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, the <b>entrainment</b> of drier air {{weakened}} Florence to {{tropical storm}} status. At the same time, its motion became nearly stationary as a ridge to its southeast weakened steering currents. An eye {{developed in the}} center of the cyclone, and Florence again attained hurricane status late on September 12. Cooler water temperatures caused the hurricane to again weaken to tropical storm status on September 13. The next day, increased vertical wind shear accelerated the weakening, leaving its cloud pattern disorganized. An approaching short-wave trough turned Florence to the east-southeast and later to the east-northeast as its forward motion increased. Convection increased near the center as the overall structure improved. Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Florence was upgraded to hurricane status on September 16 about 200mi(320km) southwest of Bermuda. Later that day, the hurricane passed about 75mi (120km) northwest of Bermuda, its closest approach. Late on September 16, Florence reached peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) as an eyewall became apparent. Cooler waters weakened the hurricane to tropical storm status by September 17 as its motion accelerated further due to the approaching trough. Later that day, Florence was absorbed by the extratropical storm associated with the trough about 80mi (130km) south of Cape Race on the island of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2010 season developed from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on October24. The wave pushed west, organizing into a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on October29 and into Tropical Storm Tomas six hours later while located {{a few hundred}} miles east of Barbados. The cyclone turned northwest after formation while continuing to intensify, moving over Barbados by 09:00UTC on October30 with winds of 70mph (110km/h); as such, Tomas became the latest storm in a calendar year to strike the Windward Islands. The system reached hurricane intensity three hours later, and by 20:00UTC, attained its peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) while moving across St. Lucia. After moving into the Caribbean, a sharp increase in wind shear and dry air <b>entrainment</b> caused Tomas to dramatically weaken, and the storm fell to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on November3. Fluctuating atmospheric conditions allowed Tomas to strengthen and oscillate between a tropical storm and hurricane as it curved through the Windward Passage and into the Atlantic. By 00:00UTC on November8, the cyclone succumbed to an increasingly unfavorable regime and became an extra{{tropical cyclone}}. The storm rotated around a broader low in the western Atlantic before being absorbed by a larger extratropical low south of Newfoundland early on November11.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} of a tropical wave and another elongated trough {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September14 about 375mi (605km) east of Chetumal, Mexico. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Karl six hours later and continued to strengthen until moving ashore near Rio Huach, Mexico, with winds of 65mph (100km/h) at 12:45UTC on September15. Although the storm's winds diminished over land, the structure of the storm actually improved, allowing Karl to quickly become a hurricane by 18:00UTC on September16 once emerging over the Bay of Campeche. A period of rapid deepening brought the cyclone to its peak of 125mph (205km/h) early on September17, the only major hurricane on record in the Bay of Campeche. Increasing shear and dry air <b>entrainment</b> caused Karl to weaken slightly, but it retained winds of 115mph (185km/h) while making landfall just north of Veracruz, Mexico by 16:45UTC on September17. The system weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, falling to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18, weakening to a tropical depression six hours later, and dissipating about 85mi (140km) southeast of Veracruz by 12:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} {{of the season}} began as a tropical wave that organized into a tropical depression southeast of Cabo Verde early on September8. Initial organization was fast-paced, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Igor six hours after formation. Igor moved west to west-northwest for several days while embedded within the monsoon trough. Increased vertical shear caused the cyclone to temporarily weaken to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September9, but it re-attained tropical storm intensity {{the next day and}} further strengthened to a hurricane by 00:00UTC on September12. After rapid intensification and a subsequent eyewall replacement cycle, Igor attained its peak with maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) by 00:00UTC on September15. Inner core changes continued after peak, and Igor continued as a Category4 hurricane for several days until increased shear and dry air <b>entrainment</b> forced a consistent weakening trend early on September17. The system recurved north-northeast while passing within 60mi (95km) of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane. It eventually made landfall near Cape Race, Newfoundland with winds of 85mph (140km/h) by 15:00UTC on September21 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone three hours later. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger such system between Greenland and Labrador on September23.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression {{traveled to the}} northwest across the southwest Gulf of Mexico. It strengthened rapidly, and there was evidence of deep convection as it passed over warm waters. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on reconnaissance aircraft observation. Six hours later, the storm accelerated to near 9mph (15km/h), meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected, preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane. However, Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast, as it maintained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h). The lack of intensification {{could be due to}} moderate wind shear and <b>entrainment</b> over the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track to the northwest toward the Rio Grande Valley area in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Texas. The storm made landfall early on August 15 along the Mexican coast about 105mi (165km) south of Brownsville, Texas, 35mi (55km) north La Pesca, Tamaulipas and about 115mi (185km) north of Tampico. Beryl was downgraded to a {{tropical depression}} about five hours after landfall. The Brownsville radar showed that the circulation center of the storm became elongated parallel to the mountain ranges of northeastern Mexico, so the system was no longer declared a tropical depression late on August 15, while located near Monterrey.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression had a broad circulation and organized deep convection. It was located over very warm water temperatures, although the upper-level environment was not conducive for significant intensification. Easterly wind shear was forecast, but the NHC anticipated the depression strengthening to 45mph (75km/h) before making landfall in Louisiana. Under {{the influence of a}} mid-level ridge to its north, the depression was forecast to track generally northwestward. Early on August11, the convection diminished significantly due to the <b>entrainment</b> of dry air and vertical wind shear from a nearby upper-level low. The circulation became difficult to locate; however, conditions favored the redevelopment of the thunderstorm activity. One tropical cyclone prediction model forecast significant intensification to a minimum pressure of 968mbar, and other models forecast the depression would reach hurricane status upon making landfall. As it continued to the northwest, the circulation remained broad and disorganized, and convection remained minimal. Late on August11, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the depression was no longer a tropical cyclone, and in post-analysis, the NHC determined that the depression was only a tropical cyclone for 12hours. Redevelopment was not anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapist}} lightly palpates the patient's body, {{and focuses}} intently on the communicated movements. A practitioner's {{feeling of being}} in tune with a patient is described as <b>entrainment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{admixtures}} {{are added}} to achieve varied properties. These ingredients may accelerate or slow down {{the rate at which}} the concrete hardens, and impart many other useful properties including increased tensile strength, <b>entrainment</b> of air and water resistance.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{melatonin}} {{is involved}} in the <b>entrainment</b> (synchronization) of the circadian rhythms including sleep-wake timing, blood pressure regulation, seasonal reproduction, and many others. Many of its biological effects in animals are produced through activation of melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as an antioxidant, with a particular role in the protection of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commonly}} found practices include developmental work (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs, songwriting and listening in reminiscence/orientation {{work with the}} elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic <b>entrainment</b> for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims. Music therapy is also used in some medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, and correctional facilities.|$|E
25|$|The earlier {{models of}} the Jameson Cell used orifice plates to {{generate}} the downcomer jet. The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life. The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air <b>entrainment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Racemic menthol {{can also}} be formed by {{hydrogenation}} of pulegone. In both cases with further processing (crystallizative <b>entrainment</b> resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) {{it is possible to}} concentrate the L enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that d-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual l-antipode.|$|E
25|$|Planktivores {{selectively}} prey upon individual zooplankton, such as copepods, mysids and gammarids. This {{group includes}} most fish larvae, delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), tule perch (Hysterocarpus traski), and salmon smolts. The delta smelt {{is of particular}} interest due to its endangered status. It may be food-limited, but the evidence is somewhat contradictory. Other factors, such as <b>entrainment</b> of eggs and larvae in the export pumping of fresh water from the Delta may also explain the decline.|$|E
25|$|The air <b>entrainment</b> {{occurs in}} the form of air bubbles and air packets {{entrapped}} at the impingement of the upstream jet flow with the roller. The air packets are broken up in very small air bubbles as they are entrained in the shear region, characterised by large air contents and maximum bubble count rates. Once the entrained bubbles are advected into regions of lesser shear, bubble collisions and coalescence lead to larger air entities that are driven towards the free-surface by a combination of buoyancy and turbulent advection.|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{in the study of}} the genetic basis of phototropism, chloroplast alignment, and stomatal aperture and other blue light-influenced processes. These traits respond to blue light, which is perceived by the phototropin light receptors. Arabidopsis has also been important in understanding the functions of another blue light receptor, cryptochrome, which is especially important for light <b>entrainment</b> to control the plants' circadian rhythms. When the onset of darkness is unusually early, A. thaliana reduces its metabolism of starch by an amount that effectively requires division.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is dependent upon}} the initial fluid speed. If the initial speed of the fluid is below the critical speed, then no jump is possible. For initial flow speeds which are not significantly above the critical speed, the transition appears as an undulating wave. As the initial flow speed increases further, the transition becomes more abrupt, until at high enough speeds, the transition front will break and curl back upon itself. When this happens, the jump can be accompanied by violent turbulence, eddying, air <b>entrainment,</b> and surface undulations, or waves.|$|E
25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen <b>entrainment,</b> or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillar}} outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so, with the precise interval varying somewhat {{in time and}} space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's distributional range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization {{is thought to be}} due to the process of <b>entrainment,</b> that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.|$|E
25|$|When Guinness is poured, the gas bubbles {{appear to}} travel {{downwards}} in the glass. The effect {{is attributed to}} drag; bubbles that touch {{the walls of a}} glass are slowed in their travel upwards. Bubbles in the centre of the glass are, however, free to rise to the surface, and thus form a rising column of bubbles. The rising bubbles create a current by the <b>entrainment</b> of the surrounding fluid. As beer rises in the centre, the beer near the outside of the glass falls. This downward flow pushes the bubbles near the glass towards the bottom. Although the effect occurs in any liquid, it is particularly noticeable in any dark nitrogen stout, as the drink combines dark-coloured liquid and light-coloured bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, diatom {{cells in}} these resting populations {{re-enter}} the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients {{in the upper}} mixed layer, setting the scene for {{the next round of}} diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous upwelling), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer. In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the <b>entrainment</b> of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an <b>entrainment</b> defect.|$|E
