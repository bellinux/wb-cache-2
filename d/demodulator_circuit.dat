The resultant single beta signal from both droplets contained an interference structure with a well-defined periodicity which was accurately measured and compared with cw lidar theory. The agreement between measurements and theory is excellent, indicating that the interference arises because the droplets are moving at different speeds and, therefore, the relative droplet separation is not constant.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Displacement sensors are key {{components}} in the closed loop control of nanopositioning systems, producing repeatable motions with nanometer resolution. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) offer a miniaturised solution for implementing low cost and high speed nanopositioners with integrated sensors. Among the MEMS displacement sensing techniques, only the electrothermal and piezoresistive sensors can be implemented for this purpose within a reasonable footprint. The performance of the aforementioned sensors is severely influenced by their inherent high noise levels, which limits the displacement resolution of the MEMS nanopositioner. As such, this thesis presents several displacement sensing techniques to improve {{the performance of the}} MEMS nanopositioners. In the first approach, a readout circuit is presented to increase the sensitivity of the electrothermal sensors. The sensor is coupled to a ring oscillator power supply by a ratiometric interface in order to convert the small resistive changes (390 ~ 400 Ω) to the wide frequency variation (350 ~ 550 kHz). Subsequently, the frequency <b>demodulator</b> <b>circuits</b> are designed to produce a voltage output. The experiments are carried out on a 1 -Degree of Freedom (1 -DoF) nanopositioner with a thermal actuator. In addition to the high sensitivity achievement, the ring oscillator nonlinearity is designed to cancel the actuator nonlinearity to produce a linear input-output transfer function, which otherwise needs a lookup table for calibration and closed loop control. The MEMS sensors are fabricated in doped silicon that inherently generates the flicker and thermal noise. The second approach in this thesis consists of two distinct solutions to mitigate the noise contribution. The flicker noise is inversely proportional to the applied heating signal frequency. Hence, a new excitation and readout technique is presented to drive the sensor with a high frequency voltage. The experiments are successfully conducted on a 1 -DoF MEMS nanopositioner, which demonstrate an 8 dB flicker noise reduction, when compared to the conventional dc (direct current) excitation. In order to alleviate the thermal noise, a multiple sensor system is developed based on the averaging theory, according to which a combination of multiple independent signals contaminated with the uncorrelated noise results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The sensors are implemented around a 1 -DoF nanopositioner in order to produce independent measurements of the displacement in real time. The experimental results on three sensors demonstrate a 4 dB SNR enhancement, which is in close agreement with the theory. Electrothermal sensors can be operated in constant current (CC) or in constant voltage (CV) excitation modes. In the third approach, an analytic comparison of the two methods is presented. It is shown that from the SNR point of view, the benefits of operating a sensor in CC mode are only marginal. The analytical investigation is supported by experiments performed on sensors integrated into a silicon on insulator (SOI) MEMS nanopositioner with low noise read out circuits, which leads to a 0. 04 nm/√Hz displacement resolution for both excitation modes. A new 2 -Degree of Freedom (2 -DoF) MEMS nanopositioner with electrothermal sensors is also presented in this dissertation for the scanning stage of the atomic force microscope (AFM), which is a significant achievement towards the miniaturisation of low cost AFMs for high speed operation. The electrothermal sensors are integrated to the stage in order to provide displacement information for a feedback control loop, which should be otherwise provided by an external sensor, such as an interferometer. The images obtained by the controlled nanopositioner demonstrate a great quality enhancement compared to the open loop nanopositioner. Finally, a piezoresistive sensing technique is presented in this thesis as an alternative integrated small area solution. Compared to the existing piezoresistive sensors, it is fabricated in the standard SOI process without any customised fabrication step. The embedded sensor is designed and characterised for a 1 -DoF nanopositioner and exploits the differential architecture to achieve higher sensitivity, linearity and common mode interference rejection...|$|R

One application is in high-speed wireless back-haul networks for mobile communication. The operators {{are interested in}} replacing optical fiber with the more flexible and easy to deploy wireless link. This substitute should provide the high capacity which is inevitable for the next generations of mobile standards and also be lightweight and low power to be practical. These requirements together with the expected high market volume of the point-to-point links mandates implementation of the radio front-end on a single semiconductor chipset. This thesis discusses how the direct carrier conversion greatly simplifies the radio front-end and therefore is an attractive alternative for single-chip integrated radio implementation at millimeter-wave. For demonstration, design and characterization of two monolithic direct carrier quadrature modulator and demodulator circuits operating at 110 GHz to 170 GHz will be presented. The circuits are fabricated in 250 nm InP Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (DHBT) technology with ft/fmax of 350 / 600 GHz and have all the active and passive components integrated into them in a compact size.

40|$|Radar can be {{utilized}} {{to detect the}} mechanical heart activity and is a potential alternative to today’s heartbeat monitoring techniques in medicine. It can detect details of the heart activity, such as filling and ejection of heart chambers and opening and closing of heart valves. This {{is due to the}} radars ability to detect movements and direction of motion. Compared to electrocardiogram and ultrasound it has the advantage that it is a contactless measurement. The objective of this thesis is the development of a proof-of-concept prototype of a novel microwave on-body sensor for heartbeat detection, which can be used inside an MRI system and which could provide prospective triggering information. The main idea is to use a microwave sensor (reflectometer) with an on-body antenna illuminating the heart and detecting the reflected signal. The measurement is based on the evaluation of the heart-related time-dependent reflection coefficient of the antenna, by minimizing the static and respiration-related components of the reflection coefficient. In a first step, this is done by minimizing the antenna mismatch with an automatic impedance matching circuit after the placement of the antenna on the chest of an individual; the antenna mismatch is dependent on the position and the individual body properties. In a second step the residual static and slow variation signal from respiration is suppressed by a canceller circuit (well-known from CW radar technology as reflected power canceller). With the reflectometer sensor system consisting of a CW signal generator (transmitter, Tx), on-body antenna, adaptive impedance matching circuit and <b>demodulator</b> <b>circuit</b> as part of the reflected signal canceller, the performance of each component influences the performance of the sensor system.

This is used in order to assess the obtained signal and relate the signal states to certain heart states.

Especially, we measured a residual phase noise of a typical free-running oscillator and used its value for the SNR analysis. Based on these analysis and the measurement results, a compact, low-cost 2. 4 GHz direct conversion bio-radar sensor was designed and implemented in a printed circuit board. The demonstrated sensor consists of two printed antennas, a 150 Jang et al. voltage-controlled oscillator, an I/Q <b>demodulator,</b> and analog <b>circuits.</b> The heartbeat and respiration signals acquired from the I/Q channel of the sensor are applied to the digital signal processing circuit using MATLAB.

The Advanced Communications Receiver consists of four units: (1) CMC processor, (2) single sideband modulator, (3) demodulator, and (4) chirp waveform generator and individual channel processors. The input signal is composed of multiple user transmission frequencies operating independently from remotely located ground terminals. This signal is Fourier transformed by the CMC Processor into a unique time slot for each user frequency. The CMC processor is driven by a waveform generator through a single sideband (SSB) modulator. The output of the coherent demodulator is composed of positive and negative pulses, which are the envelopes of the chirp transform processor output. These pulses correspond to the data symbols.
