All end-December and end-March targets were observed, inflation declined, {{the exchange rate}} stabilized, and net international reserves were increased. However, following expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during May–June, most end-June targets were missed. Also, while many structural measures were implemented as envisaged, progress on key structural measures, including the census of public employment and domestic arrears, was delayed.

From the controlling theory point of view, bank was presented as an object, that can be controlled by pricing and which is affected by random lags in loans returning. Pricing influences money flows from bank?s <b>loan</b> and <b>deposit</b> activity via function of demand on loans and function of supply of deposits, and these flows influence bank profit and capital. Volumes of <b>loan</b> and <b>deposit</b> activities depend on bank capital, therefore there is a dynamics in the model. By synthesizing these approaches, the conceptual pricing model under the conditions of random lag in <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> returning was proposed for the first time. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????. ??? ???????????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????. ? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????????, ???? ???? ??????????? ??? ??????, ??????? ????? ????????? ????? ??????????????? ? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ? ???? ????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ????????. ??????????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?????, ? ???, ? ???? ???????, ?? ??????? ? ??????? ?????. ?????? ????????-?????????? ???????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?????, ??????? ? ?????? ???????????? ????????. ? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????? ??????? ???? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> and <b>loans</b> to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits,</b> we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits,</b> such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> (4.48 trillion euros), <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), and <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R
