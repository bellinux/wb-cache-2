50|$|The {{attribution}} of this weakening of terrestrial near-surface wind speed is not conclusive, {{probably because of}} several factors which interact simultaneously, and may change in space in time. Scientists have pointed out various major causes influencing this slowdown in wind speed: (i) The increase in land-surface roughness (e.g. forest growth, land use changes and urbanization) near meteorological station where anemometer instruments measure wind lead to a reinforcement of friction force that weaken low-level winds.(ii) The variability of large-scale atmospheric circulation, associated with the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell and the shifting of centers of action (i.e. anticyclones and cyclones) controlling changes in near-surface wind speed. (iii) The changes in how wind speed is measured, including the deterioration or <b>instrumental</b> <b>drift</b> of anemometer devices; the technological improvement of anemometers; anemometer height changes; shifts in measurements sites; changes in the environment around the monitoring station; calibration issues; and measuring time intervals. (iv) The “global dimming”, i.e., the decrease in the amounts of solar radiation reaching the Earth´s surface due to increased aerosol and greenhouse gas concentrations, forces a stabilization of the atmosphere resulting in weak winds.(v) Other causes, such as increasing trends in available soil moisture, and astronomical changes., have been put forward.However, the exact causes of the “global terrestrial stilling” are still unresolved because the uncertainties behind this phenomenon across the world.|$|E

The observing efficiency can be increased by combining several source-point integrations with a common reference measurement. This is implemented at many telescopes, but a thorough investigation of the optimum calibration of the modes and the best way of performing these observations is still lacking. We use knowledge of the instrumental stability obtained by an Allan variance measurement to derive a mathematical formalism for optimizing the setup of mapping observations. Special attention has to be paid to minimizing of the impact of correlated noise introduced by the common OFF integrations and to the correction of <b>instrumental</b> <b>drifts.</b> Both aspects can be covered using a calibration scheme that interpolates between two OFF measurements and an appropriate OFF integration time. The total uncertainty of the calibrated data consisting of radiometric noise and drift noise can be minimized by adjusting the source integration time and the number of data points observed between two OFF measurements. It turns out that OTF observations are very robust. They provide a low relative noise, even if their setup deviates considerably from the optimum. Fast data readouts are often essential to minimize the drift contributions. In particular, continuum measurements may be easily spoiled by <b>instrumental</b> <b>drifts.</b> The main drawback of the described mapping modes is the limited use of the measured data at different spatial or spectroscopic resolutions obtained by additional rebinning.

On {{the basis of the}} 20 year data series, an average strain rate of - 5. 36 μstr/y was determined. Because the <b>instrumental</b> <b>drift</b> can also cause a slow change in the output signal of the sensor similar to the tectonic movements, a lot of efforts were made to determine the drift of the extensometer. The instrument has no detectable drift according to the instrumental calibrations (regular calibration, parallel recording by more displacement sensors, etc.). Since autumn of 2008, the radon concentration has been continuously monitored by an AlfaGuard instrument in the SGO. The investigation of the relationship between strain and radon concentration also showed the absence of <b>instrumental</b> <b>drift,</b> so the instrument measures real tectonic movements.

The experience of 15 years in continuous gravity monitoring on Mt. Vesuvius is discussed. Several geodynamic phenomena can produce temporal gravity changes. An eruption, for instance, {{is associated with the}} ascent of magma producing changes in the density distribution at depth, and leading to ground deformation and gravity changes The amplitude of such gravity variations is often quite small, in the order of 10 - 102 nms- 2, so their detection requires high quality data and a rigorous procedure to isolate from the records those weak gravity signals coming from different sources. Ideally we need gravity signals free of all effects which are not of volcanic origin. Therefore solid Earth tide, ocean and atmospheric loading, <b>instrumental</b> <b>drift</b> or any kind of disturbances other than due to the volcano dynamics have to be removed. The state of the art on the modelling of the solid Earth tide is reviewed. The atmospheric dynamics {{is one of the main}} sources precluding the detection of small gravity signals. The most advanced methods to reduce the atmospheric effects on gravity are presented. As the variations of the calibration factors can prevent the repeatability of high-precision measurements, new approaches to model the instrumental response of mechanical gravimeters are proposed too.

By analysing instrument theory of operation, and using numerical simulations and field data, we show {{that this is not the}} case for instruments with curvilinear calibrations; we further show that if not appropriately accounted for, concentration biases can lead to roughly proportional systematic flux errors, where the fractional errors in fluxes are about 30 – 40 % the fractional errors in concentrations. We quantify these errors and characterize their dependency on main determinants. We then propose a correction procedure that largely – potentially completely – eliminates these errors. The correction, to be applied during flux computation, is based on knowledge of instrument calibration curves and on field or laboratory calibration data.

Their on-line applicability and high measurement frequency create an interesting opportunity for process control and optimization tasks. However, building and maintaining a robust calibration model for the on-line estimation of key variables of interest (e. g., concentrations of selected metabolites) is time-consuming and costly. One of the main drawbacks of using IR spectrometers on-line is that IR spectra are compromised by both long-term drifts and short-term sudden shifts due to instrumental effects or process shifts which might be unseen during calibration. The effect of <b>instrumental</b> <b>drifts</b> can normally be reduced by referencing the measurements against a background solution, but this option is difficult to implement for single-beam instruments due to sterility issues.
