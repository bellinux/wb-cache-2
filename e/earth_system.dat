They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> science.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the <b>Earth</b> <b>system.</b> The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the <b>Earth</b> <b>system.</b> However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the correlation among science gifted students’ self-reported knowledge and self-perceived importance about <b>Earth</b> <b>systems,</b> and their science motivation. Ninety three seventh graders participated in this study who enrolled at Science Gifted Institute of K university. The correlation was measured by a validated <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> survey and Science Motivation Questionnaire (SMQ). The data were analyzed at the margin of error probability 0. 05 using correlation and regression analysis. The result of reliability for items turned out high because the Cronbach’s alphas were. 896 ~. 937. Results indicated that the correlation between self-reported knowledge on <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> and science motivation showed a correlation coefficient. 656, whereas the correlation between importance on <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> and science motivation was. 387, which was regarded as low. On the other hands, the result of regression analysis depicted that non-std. coefficients between students’ self-reported knowledge about <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> and science motivation were. 548 (. 077), which lead to the conclusion that students’ knowledge on <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> explained 43 % of science motive-variation. It implied that <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> education program could impact the increased motivation of science gifted-students. Therefore, this study suggests that the various <b>Earth</b> <b>systems</b> education programs could be developed and implemented in order to increase students’ motivation on studying science in general and Earth science in specific. ? ??? ????? ?????????? ?????(HY- 2013 ??) ...|$|R

In substation, <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> is essential not only to provide the protection of people working or walking {{in the vicinity of}} earthed facilities and equipments against the danger of electric shock but also to maintain the proper function of the electrical system.

This paper is to provide information pertinent to safe earthing practices in AC substation design and to establish the safe limits of potential differences under normal and fault conditions. Standard equations are used in the design of <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> to get desired parameters such as touch and step voltage criteria for safety, earth resistance, grid resistance, maximum grid current, minimum conductor size and electrode size, maximum fault current level and resistivity of soil.

Continuing pressure on the Earth's biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing, and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment. It is difficult to address the issue, because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans.
