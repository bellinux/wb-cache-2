We propose intercultural learning as a strategic response for dealing with different perceptions and hence for moderating the heterogeneity of information interpretation.

40|$|Islam, {{geographically}} {{located between}} the industrial Christian societies {{and the great}} religions of the Far East, {{has given rise to}} many juridical, theological, or mystical studies, but few that can be qualified strictly speaking as religions sociology studies. The effective initiation of such studies calls for certain epistemological clarifications. At the outset the sociographical collecting of data must be modelled on the ontological constructions of Islam. There follows from this the necessity of providing for explanatory systems in an intermediary position between the way in which Islam presents itself intellectually and the underlying structures which vary according to the milieu and the moment and which orient the experienced religions phenomena. Another purpose of these intermediary systems is to check, as far as is possible, the conceptual <b>ethnocentrisms</b> which tend to interpret reality in terms of a predetermined ideology. All research into this subject then must first go through a criticism and at times a new formulation of the methods of religions sociology in terms of the interrogation possibilities offered by the Moslem societies. Moreover, it is highly probable that similar ways of stating the problems are imperative {{in the study of the}} other religions.

The final version is available from [URL] Doi: 10. 1080 / 01411920600635403 Ethnocentric concepts, theories and practices in education, predominantly embedded in western philosophy and values, tend to ignore the growing multicultural nature of educational institutions. This article {{draws attention to the}} knowledge gap in mainstream literature regarding diverse perspectives of educational leadership—an issue which is foreseen as gaining higher significance with the fast-changing societal structures in Britain. Having worked as a Muslim woman educational leader/manager in higher education in an Islamic state for more than two decades, and now working at a British university, positioned as a non-White woman Muslim, the author endorses the need to move beyond <b>ethnocentrisms</b> and to work towards developing complex theoretical constructs to reconceptualise educational leadership, drawing from perspectives held by diverse ethnic groups—students and communities. How learners from diverse philosophical and ethnic backgrounds conceive and perceive educational leadership, and how they receive it, is bound to interact with their learning experience and performance. This article briefly introduces leadership as a concept formulated in context. It presents philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of these conceptualisations from an Islamic perspective, and highlights the interplay between knowledge and leadership. The article deliberates how these discourses interact to formulate 'educational leadership' in Muslim societies, and explores the implications of these constructions with a focus on the British context, where Muslims are in a minority, pointing to the significance of understanding philosophical diversity for embracing population diversity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (English Literature)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Thinking through {{notions of}} {{homelessness}} and exile, {{this study aims}} to explore how V. S. Naipaul engages with questions {{of the construction of}} self and the world after empire, as represented in four key texts: The Mimic Men, A Bend in the River, The Enigma of Arrival and A Way in the World. These texts not only map the mobility of the writer traversing vast geographical and cultural terrains as a testament to his nomadic existence, but also follow the writer’s experimentation with the novel genre. Drawing on postcolonial theory, modernist literary poetics, and aspects of critical and postmodern theory, this study illuminates the position of the migrant figure in a liminal space, a space that unsettles the authorising claims of Enlightenment thought and disrupts teleological narrative structures and coherent, homogenous constructions of the self. What emerges is the contiguity of the postcolonial, the modern and the modernist subject. This study engages with the concepts of “double consciousness” and “entanglements” to foreground the complex web and often conflicting temporalities, discourses and cultural assemblages affecting postcolonial subjectivities and unsettling narratives of origin and authenticity. While Naipaul seeks to address questions of postcolonial identity, his oeuvre is simultaneously entangled within the Anglophone literary tradition. The texts in this study foreground the convergence of the politics of writing and the politics of subjectivity. Through continuous re-writing of the self, the past and history, Naipaul focuses on the fragmentary, the partiality of knowledge and the obscurity of the present to evince the continuous renewal of subjectivities. His narratives enact deep feelings of despair and melancholy that attend the migrant position in the current age of mass migrations, technological advancement, militarism, and essentialised <b>ethnocentrisms</b> and cultural constructions. In his poetics of exile, he endorses the particular over the universal. His commitment to a “politics of difference” underscores the texts in this study and serves to foreground Naipaul’s position of otherness...|$|R

Using the term Jewish <b>ethnocentrism,</b> he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does not argue that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while MacDonald also points out that American Jews generally favor the Democratic Party, not Republicans or conservatives and he also points out that in the 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to United States Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W.

Dieser Beitrag untersucht einige dieser Annahmen mittels sozialwissenschaftlicher Modelle. Von Befunden aus der Bildungssoziologie und Sozialpsychologie bereits hinlänglich widerlegte Naivitäten wie die Annahme, Zugang zu Informationen wirke per se nivellierend, bleiben außen vor. Im Zentrum stehen die Erkenntnisse aus Pierre Bourdieus Kapitaltheorie für die Akzeptanz von Open Access und die Erkenntnisse aus Michel Foucaults Diskursanalyse für die Wirkung von Open Access innerhalb des Digital-Divide-Konzepts. Bourdieus Kapitaltheorie deutet darauf hin, dass für die Akzeptanz von Open Access bei Wissenschaftlern nicht hagiographische, wissenschaftslogische Argumente wie die Beschleunigung der Kommunikation ausschlaggebend sein dürften, sondern machtlogische Argumente: Entscheidend für die Akzeptanz von Open Access (und konzeptionell verbundener Modelle wie etwa {{alternative}} metrische Verfahren) ist, wie Wissenschaftler dessen mögliche Auswirkungen auf bestehende Akkumulationsprozesse wissenschaftlichen Kapitals wahrnehmen. Hinsichtlich der Wirkung von Open Access im Digital-Divide-Modell legt Foucaults Diskursanalyse nahe, dass Open Access Abhängigkeiten, Szientozentrismen und Ethnozentrismen verstärken kann.

40|$|Background Violence in the {{emergency}} department (ED) is a significant problem and it is increasing. Several {{studies have shown that}} violence in the ED is more likely to occur within the first hour of a patient’s presentation. Therefore, it is possible that there are some indicators of violence observable during the initial nurse-patient/relative interaction at triage. Nevertheless the problem remains inadequately investigated as many incidents are not reported and most studies that have investigated this issue are descriptive in nature. Although these studies have provided important preliminary information, they fail to reveal the complexities of the problem, in particular the cultural aspects of violence which are crucial for the ED. Aims The main aims of this study were to explore the cultural aspects of violence in the ED and to determine the possible indicators of violence at triage. Methodology Contemporary ethnography based on interpretive and post-positive paradigms was adopted to frame the methodology of this study. Methods This study was carried out at a major metropolitan ED over three months. The data collection techniques included field observations, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The data analysis framework adopted for this study incorporated Spradley's (1980) and LeCompte and Schensul's (1999) approaches. Findings The study indicated that the cultural meanings of violence were complex and highly subjective with variations among nurses which in turn influenced their responses to violence (e. g. reporting or not reporting an incident). The cultural meanings were sometimes contradictory and confusing as violence could be seen as both a challenge and a threat or predictable and unpredictable. The same type of behaviour from one individual could be perceived as violent but not for another. Many nurses perceived that violence was unpredictable and inevitable but the study demonstrated that there were indicators of violence which could be used to predict and prevent the problem. Factors such as environment, conflicting messages regarding waiting time, and patients' expectations and needs played an important part in violence. Besides, there were immediate warning signs of violence such as the overt verbal (e. g. mumbling or shouting) and covert nonverbal signs (e. g. staring or agitation). This study showed that patients' behaviours for instance being unfriendly, not appreciative, inattentive and uncooperative were better predictors of violence in the ED than their traits or problems alone. However, nurse-patient/relative behaviours and the resulting reciprocal relationship were considered central in determining if violence would occur or be avoided. Nurses' efforts to establish rapport with patients was crucial in minimising violence and needed to occur early. There was usually a ‘turning point’ that provided an opportunity for the nurse to avoid violence. Nurses’ behaviours at the ‘turning point’ strongly influence the outcome. Nurses' awareness of their personal expectations, prejudices and <b>ethnocentrisms</b> were the pivotal points in preventing escalation of violence. Conclusion This study has provided a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of the cultural aspects of violence in the ED. While violence is a complex issue with many paradoxes, there are lessons to be learned. The study indicates that effective interpersonal empathetic communication has a significant role in reducing violence in the ED. Thesis (Ph. D.)
