40|$|In Practical Financial Optimization: A Library of GAMS Models, {{the authors}} provide a diverse set of models for {{portfolio}} optimization, {{based on the}} General Algebraic Modelling System. 'GAMS' consists of a language which allows a high-level, algebraic representation of mathematical models {{and a set of}} solvers [...] - numerical algorithms [...] - to solve them. The system was developed in response to the need for powerful and flexible front-end tools to manage large, real-life models. The work begins with an overview {{of the structure of the}} GAMS language, and discusses issues relating to the management of data in GAMS models. The authors provide models for mean-variance portfolio optimization which address the question of trading off the portfolio expected return against its risk. Fixed income portfolio optimization models perform standard calculations and allow the user to bootstrap a yield curve from bond prices. Dedication models allow for standard portfolio dedication with borrowing and re-investment decisions, and are extended to deal with maximisation of horizon return and to incorporate various practical considerations on the portfolio tradeability. Immunization models provide for the factor immunization of portfolios of treasury and corporate bonds. The scenario-based portfolio optimization problem is addressed with mean absolute deviation models, tracking models, regret models, conditional VaR models, expected utility maximization models and put/call efficient frontier models. The authors employ stochastic programming for dynamic portfolio optimization, developing stochastic dedication models as stochastic extensions of the fixed income models discussed in chapter 4. Two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programs extend the scenario models analysed in Chapter 5 to allow dynamic rebalancing of portfolios as time evolves and new information becomes known. Models for structuring index funds and hedging interest rate risk on international portfolios are also provided. The final chapter provides a set of 'case studies': models for large-scale applications of portfolio optimization, which can be used as the basis for the development of business support systems to suit any special requirements, including models for the management of participating insurance policies and personal asset allocation.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) process of financial integration for international risk sharing and asset pricing in East Asia. East Asia faces significant macroeconomic challenges posed by the rebalancing of the global economy and through its continued reliance on the US dollar to underpin trade and finance within the region. These challenges have made East Asian economies susceptible to exchange-rate related balance sheet effects arising through volatility in exchange and interest rates (or simply exchange and interest rate risk). Regional financial market integration provides a means with which to reduce {{the implications of}} the region's exposure to exchange rate and interest rate risk. However, this will necessitate the improvement of international risk sharing through greater financial regionalism, a political economic process, which in East Asia has been observed to be driven by ASEAN processes. As exchange rate and interest rates are elemental sources of aggregate/macroeconomic risk in region, their dynamics and any means designed to diminish them are expected to drive asset prices across East Asia. On this basis, the thesis analyses how the ASEAN process of financial integration is driving asset returns in East Asia's financial markets. To this end, the thesis utilises new political economic frameworks and asset pricing methods to provide three empirical studies. Each of the empirical study analyses one of three interrelated aspects of regional financial integration: financial integration as an end-state; financial integration as a process, and; financial integration as unification of macroeconomic policies. Accordingly, the thesis tests the following central hypothesis: in the period 1995 - 2008, the ASEAN process of financial market integration has significantly influenced intraregional risk sharing in the East Asia region. However, the findings made through the analysis of these three interrelated aspects of financial integration indicate that, ASEAN-led regional financial integration remains a viable means with which to improve international risk sharing within East Asia. Yet, this viability is in decline as it is being usurped by the gains offered though global-based integration. Understanding and measuring the dynamics of the process of financial integration, and its implications for East Asian risk sharing, have direct implications for Asian firms. Thus, the findings made in the thesis are of importance to investors, corporate and <b>investment</b> <b>strategists</b> and for public policy makers. Based on its findings, the thesis identifies the markets in which competitive firms are anticipated to create value by raising capital on the US or Singapore financial markets. Concomitantly, the thesis indicates the markets in which competitive firms are well positioned to exploit the opportunities provided by regional financial integration to create value and to increase their profits over time...|$|R
40|$|A {{cultural}} {{political economy}} (CPE) approach is adopted {{to examine the}} rise of discourses about the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies and about their implications for power shifts in the world system. Forces such as international <b>investment</b> banks, economic <b>strategists,</b> international organizations, national governments, business media, etc. contributed in constructing and circulating ‘BRIC’ as a new economic imaginary and investment form. These involved constructions of ‘hope’ and ‘strength’ over three overlapping stages: an investor story, an investor-consumer story, and now an investor-consumer-lender story. This amalgam of discourses and practices (which are subject to continuing renegotiation in response to changing circumstances and further shifts {{in the balance of}} forces) has facilitated the gradual sedimentation and naturalization of BRIC as a potential ‘group’ and has mediated particular power shifts in the global political economy. Specifically, this (trans-) national privileging and popularization of ‘BRIC’ is contributing to the (re-) making of investment patterns and neoliberal social relations...|$|R

40|$|This article explores discourses and {{practices}} of crisis recovery from a cultural political economy (hereafter CPE) perspective. It examines the imaginaries used by (trans-) national and/or intergovernmental forces in identifying and promoting alternative road to recovery. Specifically, it focuses on how entities such as international <b>investment</b> banks, economic <b>strategists,</b> international organizations, think tanks, intergovernmental agencies, and business media, have (re-) imagined {{the role of the}} ‘BRIC’ (Brazil, Russia, India, China) economies as drivers of recovery in the context of financial crises in the USA and Europe. The article has five parts. Part one briefly addresses the rapidly developing literature on ‘cultural economy’ {{and the ways in which}} the proposed CPE approach can add to a micro-macro understanding of (financial) (dis-) orders. Part two applies this approach to the roles of nodal (trans-) national forces in making, negotiating and circulating ‘BRIC’ as an economic imaginary. Part three addresses the structural/material contexts in which the BRIC discourses were popularized by private and public sector actors in response to the continuing financial crisis that became visible in 2007. In this conjuncture, the BRIC economies were identified as sites that could facilitate ‘economic recovery’. This imagined recovery was made more credible when the BRIC countries developed their own stimulus packages. China was seen as leader of the pack here and its large national package was described by one international economist (Lardy) as ‘gold standard’ (see below). Part four examines how this package intensified some deep-rooted tensions in central-local relations such as the commodification of land and intensification of the ‘property bubble. This harms China’s subaltern groups in various ways, illustrated below by the cases of ‘house slaves’ and the plight of migrant workers’ children. Part five comments on CPE’s contribution to understanding the micro-power relations involved in constructing hope as well as on some macro-structural issues involved in attempts to stimulate recovery...|$|R
