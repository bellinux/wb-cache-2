500|$|The {{book also}} found early success with book buyers {{and the general}} public. It sold 6,000 copies {{in its first year}} and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the {{juvenile}} buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, [...] "I've been sitting alone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week." [...] Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, [...] "Just Dance" [...] debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} UK Singles Chart, on January 4, 2009. It rose to number one the next week with total sales of 65,764 copies, and {{remained}} at the top for three weeks. In an interview with Daily Mail, Gaga explained her feelings on reaching number-one in the United Kingdom saying, [...] "It's been a long running dream {{to have a big}} hit in the UK– my fans there are so sexy and the people are so innovative and free in how they think about pop culture and music. I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> in Los Angeles {{getting ready to go to}} dance rehearsal when they called and told me, and I just cried." [...] According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) the song was certified platinum, and in July 2016 it became Gaga's third song to pass one million combined sales in the United Kingdom based on streaming. By January 2017, it had been streamed 6.3 million times in the nation according to the Official Charts Company, and has sold 961,000 copies as of September 2017. In Ireland, the song debuted at number eleven, and after one week it peaked the chart. The song also peaked the Dutch Top 40 on February 28, 2009. Across Europe, [...] "Just Dance" [...] reached the top ten in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the top twenty of Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia) and France. Worldwide the song has sold over 10 million digital copies.|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E

60|$|After that I {{remember}} nothing till I {{found myself}} once more <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> <b>in</b> Montezuma's palace, which I never hoped to see again. Otomie was by me, and she brought me water {{to wash the}} paint from my body and the blood from my wound, which, leaving her own untended, she dressed skilfully, for the cut of the priest's knife was deep and I had bled much. Also she clothed herself afresh in a white robe and brought me raiment to wear, with food and drink, and I partook of them. Then I bade her eat something herself, and when she had done so I gathered my wits together and spoke to her.|$|R
60|$|That same evening, {{soon after}} dinner, a servant {{brought me a}} small packet; it was {{directed}} in a hand I knew, but had not hoped so soon to see again; being <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>apartment</b> and alone, {{there was nothing to}} prevent my immediately opening it; it contained four five-franc pieces, and a note in English.|$|R

6000|$|This novel finished, I {{replaced}} it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sisters' <b>apartment,</b> {{and looked for}} others. Their stock was ample, for they had brought home all that were current in the city; but my appetite demanded an immense supply. All this course of reading was carried on clandestinely, for I was a little ashamed of it, and fearful that my wisdom might be called in question; but this very privacy gave it additional zest.

60|$|It {{was a rough}} night. The winds {{seemed as}} if singing my uncle's requiem about the mansion; and the bloodhounds howled without as if they knew {{of the death of}} their old master.

60|$|Noah could endure no more; but, seizing {{me by the}} throat, on the retaliating principle, I {{soon had}} some such sensations as one would be apt to feel if his gullet were in a vice.

Hanging ought to be an effectual remedy for many delusions; for, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> case, the bowstring I was under certainly did wonders {{in a very short}} time. Gradually the whole scene changed.

60|$|Accordingly, in {{the evening}} the gentlemen began to come, where I let them see that I {{understood}} very well what such things meant.

In three of these I had tables placed, covered with wine and sweetmeats, the fourth had a green table for play, and the fifth was my own room, where I sat, and where I received all the company that came to pay their compliments to me. I was dressed, you may be sure, to all the advantage possible, and had all the jewels on that I was mistress of. My Lord ----, to whom I had made the invitation, sent me a set of fine music from the playhouse, and the ladies danced, and we began to be very merry, when about eleven o'clock I had notice given me {{that there were some}} gentlemen coming in masquerade. I seemed a little surprised, and began to apprehend some disturbance, when my Lord ---- perceiving it, spoke to me to be easy, for that there was a party of the guards at the door which should be ready to prevent any rudeness; and another gentleman gave me a hint as if the king was among the masks. I coloured as red as blood itself could make a face look, and expressed a great surprise; however, there was no going back, so I kept <b>my</b> station <b>in</b> <b>my</b> drawing-room, but with the folding-doors wide open.|$|R
