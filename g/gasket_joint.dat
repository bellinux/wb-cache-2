These glazing practices are {{popular in the}} major cities of the world. There are four basic types of systems that are compared.) Glazing systems that use Insulating glass which are mechanically fixed in gaskets, 2) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with wet weatherseals, 3) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with dry gasket weatherseal, and 4) Hybrid glazing system (structurally clamped). The thermal modeling is performed based upon WinIso 2 D using three different IG unit designs {{for the first three}} systems noted above. The IG unit designs evaluated are:) aluminium spacer 2) stainless steel spacer, and 3) warm edge spacer technology. The hybrid glazing system is modeled only with an aluminum spacer. After calculating the U Value for a system, the results can be used to demonstrate how to evaluate the energy consumption for a specific system in a specific location, and compare these results relative to different configurations. This paper details that mechanically fixed systems demonstrate good initial performance, but the aging of gaskets results in shrinkage. Furthermore, compression set of the gaskets allows additional air and water infiltration, rendering the system even less effective. <b>Gasket</b> <b>joint</b> systems also allow additional exposure to the elements of the middle of the aluminum system which further decreases the energy efficiency. Structural glazed systems using the warm edge technology provides an excellent U value and results in the most energy efficient system modeled...|$|E

40|$|Loss of {{pre-load}} with time, {{commonly known}} as ‘Relaxation’ is an established phenomena. Behaviour of a bolted joint depends upon the pre-load in the bolts in use, not the pre-load introduced by the mechanic. Loss of pre-load is expected due to the many factors such as embedment relaxation, gasket creep, elastic interactions, and vibration loosening or stress relaxation. In a <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint,</b> due to the gasket flexibility, relaxation is always substantial during preliminary passes, as 80 to 100 % loss is not uncommon in almost all the bolts, resulting in a dynamic behaviour. Pre-load in a <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint</b> is stabilized and retained to certain extent in the final passes only. In a non-gasketed joint, due to no gasket and no rotation its static behaviour is concluded. This paper highlights the factors affecting the amount of relaxation with time and presents important considerations that can reduce this. Both the {{short and long term}} relaxations are recorded and a ‘best fit’ model for relaxation behaviour is derived. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of industrial installation requires minimum leakage of pressurized sealed joints during operation. At the design stage, the leakage {{behavior of the}} gasket {{must be one of}} the most important parameter in the gasket selection. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop an analytical leak rate prediction methodology used in <b>gasketed</b> <b>joints.</b> A pseudo analytical-experimental innovative approach was used to estimate the characteristics of the porous structure for the purpose of predicting accurate leak rate through gaskets with different fluids under conditions similar to those of operation. The analytical model assumes the flow to be continuum but employs a slip boundary con dition on the leak path wall to determine the porosity parameters of the gasket. The analytical model results are vali dated and confronted against experimental data which were conducted under various conditions of fluid media, pressure, gasket stress and temperature.

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted flange joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional <b>gasketed</b> <b>joints</b> and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional <b>gasketed</b> flange <b>joints.</b> Recommendations are made for a best-fit flange model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a flange joint...|$|R
50|$|In many applications, {{elasticity}} in a bolt significantly {{helps to}} keep a joint held together. Tests have shown turbine-type MJTs increase the elasticity of the average bolting system by the equivalent of four stud diameters, and nut-type MJTs increase the elasticity by 4 to 12 diameter equivalents, which would triple or quadruple the elasticity of the bolting system. In other words, MJTs increase elasticity by adding up to 2 to 4 equivalent bolt effective lengths. This is particularly advantageous in high-temperature bolting applications where bolts are subject to creep, because elastic bolting systems will take longer to reach a given relaxation stress than in a rigid system. Elastic bolting systems can also improve the integrity of <b>gasketed</b> <b>joints</b> by compensating for temperature changes, joint movement and changes in internal pressure.|$|R
40|$|Gasketless {{flanged joints}} with metal to metal contact offer some {{advantages}} over <b>gasketed</b> <b>joints</b> such as lower weight and better fatigue life.

Engineering intuition suggests that the role of geometrical nonlinearities might be small for such problems. However, many engineers continue to use the fully nonlinear analyses. Our aim in this paper is simply to put on record that significant savings in time can be obtained by turning off geometric nonlinearities in such analyses, with negligible loss of accuracy.

50|$|The early {{prototype}} Twin Cam engines {{had considerable}} {{trouble with the}} oiling system. These problems delayed release of the engine as scheduled for the 1997 model year. When the engines were run, oil came out any <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint</b> {{as well as the}} breather. Harley sought the help of Paul Troxler, a young engineer from Southwest Research Institute and eventually the problem was traced to a design which drained the cam case into the crankcase, and used a single scavenge pump. Due to airflow through ports in the crankcase wall, the cam case was not draining properly. After much testing, the solution was to seal the cam case from the crankcase and use a dual scavenge system, which was incorporated into the engine, rather than as an outboard pump as used on older Big Twins since the original Knucklehead. However, oil was still not scavenging properly from the crankcase, and this was traced to an acoustic phenomenon due to the caliber of the scavenge inlet. Restricting the diameter of the inlet, a counter-intuitive solution, solved that problem.|$|R
5000|$|During normal operation, a {{small amount}} of {{unburned}} fuel and exhaust gases escape around the piston rings and enter the crankcase, referred to as [...] "blow-by". [...] If these gases had no controlled escape mechanism, the <b>gasketed</b> <b>joints</b> would leak (as they [...] "found their own way out"); also, if the gases remained in the crankcase and condensed, the oil would become diluted and chemically degraded over time, decreasing its ability to lubricate. Condensed water would also cause parts of the engine to rust. [...] To counter this, a crankcase ventilation system exists. In all modern vehicles, this consists of a channel to expel the gases out of the crankcase, through an oil-separating baffle, to the PCV valve, into the intake manifold. In a non-turbo engine, the intake manifold is at a lower pressure than the crankcase, providing the suction to keep the ventilation system going. A turbo engine usually has a check valve somewhere in the tubing to avoid pressurizing the crankcase when the turbo produces boost.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: From {{analytical}} {{contact pressure}} studies of gasketed and non-gasketed flanged pipe joints, {{it is known}} that good contact maintained over consistently large areas occurs in a no-gasketed flange joint compared with a <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint,</b> where contact is only on the seal ring portion of the gasket. However, the presence of contact pressure and a good flange surface finish does not in itself eliminate the problem of leakage. Rather, it is the surface flatness in combination with contact pressure and surface finish that is necessary to generate effective contact at the inside diameter of the flange. This occurs providing there are no gaps due to deformation arising from the welding process to the mating pipe as flow is proportional to gap height. However, the question remains as how to ensure adequate surface flatness as non-gasketed flange surfaces are sensitive to damage, which may be present in the form of surface deformation, scratches and dents or bulges. A detailed experimental study is therefore carried out to measure the surface finish and surface flatness post manufacture and welding of such flanges. Results of actual flanges were compared with solid circular plates of the same dimension with inserted shims to provide gaps in order that flow rate/gap height ratio be studied. Manufacturing issues with respect to monitoring and controlling deformations are discussed and recommendations are suggested for flange redesign, appropriate welding approaches and manual handling of non-gasketed flanges...|$|R

The proximity (deflection) gage holes for the first test (Test No. 1) were incorrectly located; therefore, the test was declared a non-test. Prior to Test No. 2, test article configuration was modified with the correct proximity gage locations. Deflection data were successfully acquired during Test No. 2. However, the proximity gage deflection measurements were adversely affected by temperature increases. Deflections measured after the temperature rise at the proximity gages were considered unreliable. An analysis {{was performed}} to predict the maximum deflections based on the reliable data measured before the detectable temperature rise. Deflections to the primary seal crown location were adjusted to correspond {{to the time of}} maximum expected operating pressure (2, 159 psi) to account for proximity gage bias, and to account for maximum attach and special bolt relaxation.

40|$|Immersed tunnels are {{particularly}} sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations {{such as those}} imposed by a normal seismogenic fault rupturing underneath, and those generated by the dynamic response due to seismic waves. The paper investigates the response of a future 70 m deep immersed tunnel to the consecutive action of a major normal fault rupturing in an earthquake occurring in the basement rock underneath the tunnel, and a subsequent strong excitation from a different large-magnitude seismic event that may occur years later. Non-linear finite elements model the quasi-static fault rupture propagation through the thick soil deposit overlying the bedrock and the ensuing interaction of the rupture with the immersed tunnel. It is shown that despite imposed bedrock offset of 2 m, net tension or excessive compression between tunnel segments could be avoided with a suitable design of the <b>joint</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Then, the already deformed (""injured"") structure is subjected to strong asynchronous seismic shaking. The thick-walled tunnel is modelled as a 3 -D massive flexural beam connected to the soil through properly-calibrated nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, the supports of which are subjected to the free-field acceleration time histories. The latter, obtained with 1 -D wave propagation analysis, are then modified to account for wave passage effects. The joints between tunnel segments are modeled with special non-linear hyper-elastic elements, properly accounting for their 7 -bar longitudinal hydrostatic pre-stressing. Sliding is captured with special gap elements. The effect of segment length and joint properties is explored parametrically. A fascinating conclusion emerges in all analysed cases for the joints between segments that were differentially deformed after the quasi-static fault rupture: upon subsequent very strong seismic shaking, overstressed joints de-compress and understressed joints re-compress-a ""healing"" process {{that leads to a}} more uniform deformation profile along the tunnel.

40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of <b>gasketed</b> flanged <b>joint</b> design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium.
