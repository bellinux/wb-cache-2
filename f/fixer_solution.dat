50|$|The silver stain {{does not}} require fog centres on crystals, {{although}} they tend to occur in or near exposed areas. The silver stain can take a range of appearances, but one example is dichroic fog. Silver stains form on various hosts, such as tiny silver sulfide particles that may {{be present in the}} emulsion coating. They are very tiny and not visible, unless they are grown to larger sizes. Usual developers (that require silver ions supplied from within the silver halide crystal) do not grow these particles, but physical developers (that use silver ions from the solution to grow the development site) do. All modern practical developers function primarily as non-physical developers, but this type of fog may be seen when developed film is brought directly into exhausted <b>fixer</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E

In view of escalating cost of silver metal and the compelling need for pollution abatement, {{it is essential to}} recover silver from the <b>fixer</b> <b>solution.</b> During the processing of films, 20 - 25 % of silver is left in the black and white films. Whereas in the case of colour films essentially all silver is dissolved into the solution. Since, the silver concentration in these solution are very low (2 - 5 g/l) it is important to analyse the silver in the solution before and after recovery. Experiments were carried to analyse the silver contents of photographic solutions using cyclic voltammetric technique. Effect of silver concentrations as well as effect of sweep rates were found out in the quick estimation of silver in the photographic solutions. Compared with other methods, this voltammetric technique seems to give silver concentration of photographic solutions in short duration without affecting the nature of the solution...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to measure glutaraldehyde, acetic acid and sulfur dioxide and levels inside wet x-ray {{processing}} areas in a developing country and comparing data with those in developed countries. Forty-five radiographers from 10 educational hospitals affiliated to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) in Tehran, Iran participated in this descriptive-analytical study. Exposure to glutaraldehyde (a constituent of developer chemistry), acetic acid (a constituent of fixer chemistry) and sulfur dioxide (a byproduct of sulfites present in both developer and <b>fixer</b> <b>solutions)</b> was measured in all participants as well as area exposure. Average full-shift exposure to glutaraldehyde, acetic acid and sulfur dioxide were 0. 0018, 2. 65 and 1. 64 mg m - 3, respectively. The results showed that the TUMS radiographers full-shift exposures are generally lower than the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommended levels. The concentration of glutaraldehyde collected by area sampling (darkroom) was almost five times (0. 0104 mg m - 3) greater than taken by personal sampling. Exposure to the chemical pollutants in the currents study were generally higher than in developed countries. Identification of these key exposure determinants is useful in targeting exposure evaluation and controls to reduce developer and fixer chemicals exposures in the radiology departments.

40|$|In colour photography, {{the film}} is first treated with bleach {{solution}} so that the reduced silver is oxidized to soluble silver ion which is subsequently dissolved in sodium thiosulphate bringing all silver into the solution. During bleaching, the ferricyanide bleach is reduced to ferrous state affecting its efficacy leading to its disposal. Similarly the build up of silver concentration in the thiosulfate complex also leads to its rejection. The disposal of large quantities of chemicals not only poses environmental hazard but also loss of valuable chemicals. This necessitates the recovery of silver from thiosulfate complex and regeneration of bleach solution which facilitate the recycling of the regenerated bleach and <b>fixer</b> <b>solution</b> in the system, thereby avoiding the pollution problem. Eventhough various methods are available for the recovery of silver and regeneration of bleach, electrolytic method offers the advantage of not altering the composition of solution and totally avoiding the use of unwanted chemicals, thereby making the solution suitable for efficient reuse.

40|$|Industries such as {{mining and}} {{industrial}} minerals, metallurgical, photographic, textile, leather and chemical produce wastewater containing heavy metals that are hazardous to {{man and the}} environment. Indiscriminate discharge of these effluents pollutes natural resources and disturbs vital eco systems.

Therefore a sustainable pollution control option for these industries should aim at resource recovery. Successful isolation of heavy metals from wastewaters will not only render such effluents non hazardous but also make waste management an attractive proposition, thus leading to multiple benefits in terms of resource conservation, pollution control and treatment cost savings.

Materials and methods: MSSA, MRSA, and MLRSA strains obtained from clinical samples of an outbreak that occurred in 2010 at the Intensive Care Unit of our Hospital were thawed and sown at 37 °C in blood agar overnight. After that, they were washed, pelleted, and treated with a <b>fixer</b> <b>solution.</b> Pellets were dehydrated and finally embedded in resin. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize cell wall and septum thickening in all isolates. The comparison between the measurements obtained for each group was performed by a Kruskal–Wallis test and a post hoc Dunn–Bonferroni’s pairwise comparison method. Results: Differences in cell wall and septum thickness were statistically significant (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 001, respectively) between the three groups. Moreover, significant differences were detected in wall and septum thickness between the MSSA and MRSA strains (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 001, respectively) and between the MSSA and MLRSA strains (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 001, respectively) but not between the MRSA and MLRSA strains (P= 0. 386 and P= 0. 117).

40|$|Background and Aim: Dental Amalgam is {{a common}} {{restorative}} material for posterior teeth. Because of Hg content {{in the composition of}} amalgam, during the handling of material, mercury may release as vapor in the environment. Excess amount of mercury vapor can cause serious health problems in dental personnel. The aim of this investigation was to determine mercury vapor concentration in working environment of dentists in Tehran. Materials and Methods: 211 dental clinics were participated in this cross-sectional study. The clinics were randomly selected from different regions of Tehran (north, center, south, east and west). The dentists were asked to complete a questionnaire including items on demographic characteristics such as age, sex and work history, method of handling of amalgam, environmental characteristics and general health conditions. Environmental measurements of mercury vapor in dentists’ offices were done by mercury absorption tubes (Hydrar) and personal pumps (SKC, 222 - 3, England) as suggested in NIOSH method. Analysis of air samples was done by atomic absorption spectrophotometery (cold vapor). The data were analyzed by non-parametric tests (Kruskall Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Kendall). P< 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: The mean mercury vapor concentration in dentists’ offices was 8. 39 (± 9. 68) µg/m³. There was no significant relationship between the urine mercury of dentists (3. 107 ± 3. 95) and the air Hg vapor concentration of their offices. Using precapsulated amalgam showed significantly less Hg vapor than bulk amalgam (P= 0. 034). Also the surface area of working room and air Hg vapor (P= 0. 009) had a significant relationship (P= 0. 009 r= 0. 81). There was not any significant correlation between mercury vapor and other factors such as working hours per day and working days per week, squeezing of triturated amalgam or not, storage medium of set amalgam (water or <b>fixer</b> <b>solution),</b> mercury storage method and type of ventilation. Conclusion: The concentration of mercury vapor in dental offices' environment was lower than threshold limit value.

The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the application of electro-winning technique for selective removal of Ag metals from photo processing effluent. The laboratory scale electro-winning cell was a beaker of 12. 7 cm in diameter and having a capacity of 250 ml. The anode was of stainless steel of size 7. 5 x 4. 5 cm 2. A carbon plate of 1 cm thick (7. 5 x 4. 5 cm 2 ") of 99. 5 % carbon was used as the cathode. The circuit consisted of an electrolyte bath a precision type milli-ammeter and an adjustable resistant in series, and a voltmeter connected across the electrodes in the bath. During the electrolysis, samples were taken after 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 & 180 minutes intervals respectively at each of the current density values corresponding to 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100 & 110 From each solution three aliquots were pipeted out & analyzed In the electro-chemical method the electrowinned solution was filtered and the residue was treated with. Ammonium Nitrate reagent In the third approach the photo processing effluent was subjected to electro-winning process using a current: voltage ratio of 2. 2 to 2. 8. In the first approach, industrial photo processing effluent having 2400 -Pfm of Ag was subjected to electro-winning technique at current density of 82 mA/cm 2. However in three hours, only 14 % of Ag was deposited on the cathode and considerable amount of precipitate was visible {{at the bottom of the}} cell. This black precipitate resembled typical AgS precipitate and is thought to be formed due to oxidation of S 203 to elemental sulfur that preferentially binds with Ag". The interference from S drastically reduced the recovery potential of Ag at the investigated process condition thus rendering the process technically aid economically non viable. In the second approach, the same effluent was subjected to an electro chemical method giving 14 % of Ag deposition on cathode and 72 % of Ag was extracted from chemical methods. However the use of number of expensive chemicals and heating make this method economically less attractive. The use of very low voltage with a current: voltage ratio of 2. 2 - 2. 8 does not provide sufficient energy for oxidation of S 203 thus avoiding S interference on Ag" reduction. Under this process condition, a remarkable Ag recovery of 86 % was achieved at the current density of 82 mA/cm 2.
