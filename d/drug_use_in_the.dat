5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} the dose of the drug is an {{important}} determinant of outcome, in addition to how much is used, for how long, {{and what kind of}} care is rendered after birth. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome. The effects of PCE later in a child's life are poorly understood; there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five. Some studies have found PCE-related differences in height and weight while others have not; these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are school age. Much is still not known about what factors may exist to aid children who were exposed to cocaine in utero. It is unknown if the effects of PCE are increased once children reach adolescence, or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects. A review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in PCE adolescents, but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms.|$|E
500|$|Dr. William Boone, {{political}} science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said drug influence should not have been cause for prosecutors to dismiss the threat, and that drugs have historically caused criminals to follow through with such crimes and schemes. Boone said, [...] "The whole idea of just dismissing it as not credible is incredible. ... It’s surprising given the whole history of crime and <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Around the holidays, {{he was so}} broke he had {{to borrow}} money for groceries. Bissell {{was found dead in}} his {{apartment}} in Hoboken, New Jersey on December 29, 1987. At the time of his death, he was engaged to fellow dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, soloist Amy Rose, and had planned to rejoin the company in January of the following year. The results of an autopsy showed that he died from an overdose of cocaine, codeine, methadone and other drugs. It never was determined whether Bissell's death was a deliberate suicide. His death prompted charges of extensive <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dance world by Bissell's parents and fellow-dancer Gelsey Kirkland. Kirkland's autobiography Dancing on My Grave mentions Bissell's frequent use of cocaine and, when discussing her own addiction, she alleged that he had introduced her to the drug. Attention was also drawn to the drug therapy program offered by the American Ballet Theatre. According to the company's executive director, Charles Dillingham, Bissell had been participating in the therapy program instituted by the company and had [...] "appeared to have been making progress" [...] prior to his death. Gelsey Kirkland alleged that Bissell's death was [...] "an unavoidable tragedy caused at least in part by the failure of the ballet world and American Ballet Theater in particular to acknowledge and deal openly with the drug problem", which contrasted with [...] Dillingham's statement that [...] "his death came as an utterly horrible surprise". The 1988 production of La Bayadère by the American Ballet Theatre was dedicated to Bissell who had been notable in the rôle of Solor.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the legal}} system of the U.S. based on common law, motivations for {{lawsuits}} can range from legitimate legal grounds to cases filed {{with the intent of}} shaping case law to favor the socio-political aims of special interest groups. [...] Clubs around the country have personnel and clientele that are purported to engage in not only sex acts on the premises, but also drug use and other criminalized activities. Incidents of such activity vary widely. Their prevalence is dependent on regional differences in the attitudes of management, entertainers, customers, and law enforcement. Strip clubs are obligated to enforce age limits for entry to the clubs and consumption of alcohol. If a club is found to have served a person under the age of 21 alcohol it can have its liquor license suspended or rescinded for repeated violations. Licenses can also be lost due to evidence of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club. Club owners have closed their businesses as a result of losing a liquor license.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, The Comics Journal #174 {{featured}} a Bill Willingham caricature of Sim {{on one of}} the covers, bearing the title [...] "Dave Sim: Misogynist Guru of Self-Publishers". Inside was a lengthy article written by Jonathan Hagey and Kim Thompson that published responses from comics creators such as Alan Moore, Seth, Rick Veitch, Steve Bissette, and Sim's friend and fellow Canadian Chester Brown. The responses ranged from anger to a belief that Sim was joking. Others would later speculate that Sim was suffering from a mental illness related to his heavy <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. The article also included a short interview with Sim's ex-wife, wherein she described the essay as evidence of Sim being [...] "very scared". Accompanying the article was an illustration of Sim as a Nazi German concentration camp warden, standing before a gate with the name of his publishing company, with emaciated camp prisoners behind the fence. In the essay in Cerebus #186, Sim characterized fellow self-publishing cartoonist Jeff Smith {{as an example of a}} man dominated by his wife. When Smith contested this, Sim accused Smith of lying and challenged Smith to a boxing match, which Smith declined.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte has {{justified}} {{the drug war}} by claiming that the Philippines was becoming a [...] "narco-state". According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the prevalence of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country {{is lower than the}} global average. Duterte has dismissed human rights concerns by dehumanizing drug users, stating in August 2016: [...] "Crime against humanity? In the first place, I'd like to be frank with you. Are they humans? What is your definition of a human being?" [...] In {{the first three months of}} Duterte's term in office, according to police figures, over 3,000 killings were attributed to his nationwide anti-drug campaign. More than half were attributed to vigilantes. At the beginning of October, a senior police officer told The Guardian that 10 [...] "special ops" [...] official police death squads had been operating, and that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects. He described how the corpses were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" [...] victims), or had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender, so that the killing would not be investigated. The chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, Chito Gascon, was quoted in the report: [...] "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." [...] The Philippine National Police declined to comment. The report stated: [...] "although the Guardian can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder." ...|$|E
