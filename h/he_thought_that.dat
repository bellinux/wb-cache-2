5|$|Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy, {{commander}} of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.|$|E
5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{she saw in}} {{him what}} {{no one else could}} see. <b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> in the whole world there were no other eyes that looked upon him with the same light and {{strength}} as hers.|$|R
6000|$|... --She too {{wants me}} to catch hold of her, <b>he</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>That's</b> why she came {{with me to the}} tram. I could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her.|$|R
60|$|Somerset heedfully remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{recognized}} <b>that</b> name Power, as one he {{had seen}} lately, somewhere or other.|$|R
5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{predicted}} {{in a famous}} letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate Independence Day on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} A. McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he might be planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason.|$|E
60|$|Martin {{said what}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>that</b> {{part of the}} country, in pretty strong terms.|$|R
60|$|George said <b>he</b> little <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{afternoon}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should ever}} come to really like boating.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. <b>He</b> <b>thought,</b> even, <b>that</b> she {{had gone}} away. Then her reply came back.|$|R
5|$|The Hollywood Reporter critic Jay A. Fernandez {{said that}} Never Let Me Go was an {{engaging}} film, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> its overall impact {{was not as}} emotionally devastating as the book. Cleveland Magazines Clint O'Connor strongly approved the acting performance of Garfield, and Eric Kohn from IndieWire praised the script and the photography of Kimmel and Garland.|$|E
5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E

6000|$|FENWICK. What do I care? I {{loved you}} too. Little <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>that,</b> little {{either of you}} <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> His blood--I'll have his blood! ...|$|R
5|$|Belgrano {{met with}} the Congress of Tucuman on 6 July 1816 to explain {{the results of his}} {{diplomatic}} mission in Europe. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> enacting a local monarchy would help to prevent anarchy, which would not end simply with independence from Spain. He felt a declaration of independence would be more easily accepted by the European powers if it created a monarchic system. To this end he formulated the Inca Plan: a monarchy ruled by a noble of the Inca civilisation. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this would generate support from the indigenous populations as well, and repair the actions taken against the Inca by the Spanish colonisation. This proposal was supported by San Martín, Güemes, the deputies from the Upper Peru, and other provinces, but it found a strong rejection from Buenos Aires; they would not accept Cuzco as the capital city. On 9 July the Congress finally signed the Declaration of Independence from Spain. The flag created by Belgrano, which was being used without a law regulating it, was accepted as the national flag. The Inca Plan was still under discussion, but the Congress delayed it due to several states of emergency in the provinces caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He also argued that public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> rapidly <b>that</b> if {{she cared}} {{for him at}} all she would say she {{preferred}} to stay there.|$|R
60|$|She {{had shown}} herself, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> in <b>that</b> moment of {{reviving}} anger, too ready {{to believe what}} told against him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought,</b> however, <b>that</b> the {{greatest}} trouble would be {{had at the}} lane, and he believed he was fully prepared for it.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his {{best course of action}} would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E
5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Renshaw's eyes showed so plainly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> otherwise, <b>that</b> {{she drew}} a little austerely towards {{the door of her}} state-room.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>that</b> {{last night}} and saw now with clearer eyes the sacrifices and the trials silently borne for love of Bess.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
