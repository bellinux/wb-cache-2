6000|$|... "Gee!"

60|$|The Bravo {{ceased to}} adjust the {{disguise}} of <b>his</b> <b>companion,</b> and the profound stillness which succeeded his remark proved so painful to Antonio, that he felt like one reprieved from suffocation, {{when he heard the}} deep respiration that announced the relief of <b>his</b> <b>companion.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ulf {{found no}} {{difficulty}} in mounting to the top, {{although he was}} much longer than <b>his</b> <b>companion</b> in getting up.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} <b>his</b> <b>companions.</b> The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of <b>his</b> <b>companions,</b> unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on January 16, 1967.

Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E

He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E
