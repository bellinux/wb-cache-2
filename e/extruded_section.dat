The upstream solution {{is characterized by a}} two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer with a thickness approximately half of the maximum hump thickness measured at a location about two chord lengths upstream of the leading edge. The Reynolds number based on the hump chord length is 9. 75 × 10 5.

Four different conditions were examined, these being ambient (23 °C, 50 % humidity), hot-dry (60 °C, low humidity), room-wet (23 °C, high humidity) and hot-wet(60 °C, high humidity). Three different matrix polymers were used, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC). The composites were reinforced with 44 - 59 wt% wood flour. Extruded composites manufactured using both the Washington State University (WSU) and Strandex processes were examined for all three matrix polymers. Extruded HDPE composites manufactured by the ModWood process were also examined. The addition of wood flour increased the elastic modulus but decreased the strength and strain to failure for all three matrix polymers. The strength and modulus were highest for the PVC composites, intermediate for the PP composites and lowest for the HDPE composites. Testing in the hot-wet condition produced substantial changes in strength (45 %), modulus (54 %) and strain to failure (275 %). The changes were greatest for the HDPE composites, but less for the PP composites than for the PVC composites. The individual effects of temperature and moisture appeared to be additive for the HDPE and PVC composites but not for the PP composites. As for the quasi-static behavior, the creep and stress relaxation behavior was best for the PVC composites, intermediate for the PP composites and poorest for the HDPE composites. The stress relaxation was increased on average by 18 % in the hot-dry condition, by 43 % in the room-wet condition and by 59 % in the hot-wet condition. The individual effects of temperature and moisture appeared to be additive for the HDPE but not for the PP composites. The results for the PVC composites were unclear. The quasi-static mechanical properties were highest {{at the edge of the}} <b>extruded</b> <b>section,</b> decreasing progressively to the centre where they were reduced by a factor of two.

50|$|Many {{standard}} magnesium alloys {{are easily}} welded by gas or resistance-welding equipment, but cannot be cut with an oxygen torch. Magnesium alloys are not welded to other metals, because brittle inter-metallic compounds may form, {{or because the}} combination of metals may promote corrosion.

The solders are even more corrosive than with aluminium, and the parts should never be required to withstand stress. Riveted joints in magnesium alloy structures usually employ aluminium or aluminium-magnesium alloy rivets. Magnesium rivets are not often used because they must be driven when hot. The rivet holes should be drilled, especially in heavy sheet and <b>extruded</b> <b>sections,</b> since punching tends to give a rough edge to the hole and to cause stress concentrations.|$|R

50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and <b>extruded</b> <b>sections</b> were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding.
