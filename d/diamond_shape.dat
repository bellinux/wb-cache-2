The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over green, in a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape,</b> although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E

She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and {{had never had a}} chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> formation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{investigation}} of performance of heat sink with variable pin attached along with uniform fin. The present work {{deals with the}} computational analysis of flow (CFD analysis) and heat transfer with pin fin. In the present work a <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> pin fin are used and is investigated under constant heat flux condition at the place of plane fin or elliptical pin fin. Here compare the results of different parameters i. e. major diagonal and minor diagonal. The <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> pin fin heat sink with three different length and three different widths are accomplished {{to examine the effects}} of the pin fin shape of the heat sink on the thermal performance. Effects of different geometrical configurations parameters of the <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> pin fin heat sink and heat flux on the heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop are considered. This study gives good co relation with width and length of the <b>Diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> pin fin and also with width the thermal performance varies. The investigation is to reduce the thermal resistance also with considerable pressure drop for different profiles. The purposes of this study reduce the thermal resistance and increase the pressure drop at various wind velocity. 6 mm major & 3 mm minor axis <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> pin fin is shown in below figure 1...|$|R

5|$|Upon formation, the 2/15th {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Robert Marlan, an Australian Staff Corps officer of the Permanent Military Forces who arrived on {{promotion}} from major, having previously served in World War I with the 20th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 15th Battalion, a unit that had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were initially purple and red in a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape,</b> but after representations from World War I veterans the colour patch was changed to brown over dark blue, in a rectangle shape. The patch was placed inside a grey diamond border added to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this would change following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP consisting of blue and green.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{fast moving}} window algorithms for calculating local statistics in a diamond, hexagon, and general polygonal shaped windows {{of an image}} which is important for real-time applications. The algorithms for a <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> window requires only seven or eight additions and subtractions per pixel. A fast sparse algorithm only needs four additions and subtractions for a sparse <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped</b> window. A number of other <b>shapes</b> of <b>diamond</b> windows such as skewed or parallelogram <b>shaped</b> <b>diamond,</b> long diamond, and lozenged <b>diamond</b> <b>shaped,</b> are also investigated. Similar algorithms are also developed for hexagon shaped windows. The computation for a hexagon window only needs eight additions and subtractions for each pixel. Fast algorithms for general polygonal shaped windows are also developed. The computation cost of all these algorithms is independent of the window size. A variety of synthetic and real images have been tested...|$|R

25|$|There {{were several}} {{variants}} of the violin bow fibula. The bow could bend, or zig-zag {{from side to}} side while still remaining flat and parallel to the pin. These variants, such as the Grunwald type and the Hanua type, were found in the 12th and 11th centuries BC. In another variant, the bow, while still flat, widened out into an oval or <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> (blattbugel in German). These variants, such as the Kreuznach type and Reisen type, were found in the 12th to 10th centuries BC.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the war, the 2/13th had six {{different}} Unit Colour Patches (UCPs). The colours initially {{chosen for the}} battalion's UCP {{were the same as}} those of the 13th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were light blue over dark blue, in a horizontal rectangle shape, with a border of gray in a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> was later added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart. Later, as the 7th Division was formed, it was decided that the division's colour patches would utilise a <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> to set them apart from the battalions of the 6th Division, so the battalion's colour patch was changed to a light blue over dark blue diamond. This was later changed to a black and red diamond inside a gray diamond border to conform with regulations that stipulated that the 20th Brigade's defining colour was to be red, although this did not last long, with the light blue over dark blue rectangle being restored shortly afterwards, being presented inside a gray diamond. A further change occurred when the battalion was transferred to the 9th Division, at which point it adopted a light blue over dark blue rectangle inside a gray circle. This remained the battalion's UCP until after the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP.|$|E

25|$|Formed from volunteers {{drawn from}} the state of Victoria, the {{battalion}} consisted of four companies, under a headquarters company. The battalion subsequently served on the Western Front from mid-1916 {{until the end of the}} war. To identify the battalion's personnel, they were issued with a purple and white Unit Colour Patch. The colours were in common with other Australian pioneer battalions, while the <b>diamond</b> <b>shape</b> denoted that the unit was part of the 2nd Division. The battalion's first major action was fought around the Pozieres heights in late July 1916, during which it suffered over 200 casualties during a two-week period.|$|E
25|$|The {{general design}} of the Ghirlandaio Type, as in the 1486 painting, is related to Holbein Type 1. It is defined by one or two central medallions of <b>diamond</b> <b>shape,</b> {{consisting}} of an octagon within a square, from whose sides triangular, curvilinear patterns arise. Carpets with this medallion have been woven in the Western Anatolian region of Çanakkale since the 16th century. A carpet fragment with a Ghirlandaio medallion {{was found in the}} Divriği Great Mosque, and dated to the 16th century.
