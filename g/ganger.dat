5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by <b>Ganger</b> Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As <b>Ganger</b> Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer <b>Ganger</b> struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves <b>Ganger</b> works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a <b>Ganger</b> version of the Doctor.|$|E

One other casualty was a police constable who was hit by a train while guarding Randalstown viaduct.|$|E
25|$|Álaborg or Áluborg is {{the name}} of a Varangian fort {{mentioned}} in the Norse sagas about Halfdan Eysteinsson and Hrolf <b>Ganger.</b> The first saga indicates {{that it was possible to}} sail from Aldeigjuborg (Ladoga) to Alaborg northward by sea, but a more rapid and practicable way was by land eastward. The text implies that Alaborg and Aldeigjuborg were two rivals, situated at a short distance from each other.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing {{were killed}} when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead.

5000|$|The players must {{stack the}} falling Jammers from the {{original}} game (or {{a new type of}} Cosmo <b>Gangers</b> called [...] "Pipopapo-Tai") and Containers into groups by using their joysticks to move pieces left, right and down and pressing their buttons to rotate them; when a player fills a line of Containers, they will disappear. When a ball appears, note which direction the arrow on it is facing, as it will move in that direction when it drops - and it shall eliminate any Cosmo <b>Gangers</b> it hits on its way {{down to the bottom of}} the screen. If a player has chosen to start the game on [...] "Normal", [...] "Hard" [...] or [...] "Expert" [...] difficulty level, their [...] "Star Meter" [...] will fill up every time a ball eliminates a Cosmo Ganger; once it's completely filled, a Star will fall down from the top of the screen and eliminate seven rows of Cosmo <b>Gangers</b> when it lands. The two-player mode can, like The Return of Ishtar, all six of the World Stadium games, its predecessor, and F/A, be played with one credit - and in that mode, not only will eliminating a lot of the Cosmo <b>Gangers</b> at once result in a higher score but it can also cause a group of the eliminating player's Cosmo <b>Gangers</b> to fall down on his opponent's side of the screen. As with other falling puzzle games, the game will be over once the pieces reach the top of the screen; this is also the first game from Namco to not have an ending since Dig Dug II in 1985, which means that the closest a player can get to winning it is by getting 9,999,999 points, eliminating 9,999 Cosmo <b>Gangers,</b> clearing 9,999 lines, reaching level 999, or (for two-player mode) winning 99 times.|$|R
25|$|During the war the Norwegian Aviation Board {{had been}} {{established}} {{with a combination of}} public and private representatives. Following liberation in May 1945, negotiations started concerning the re-establishment of civilian aviation, where Thomas Olsen participated. These lasted until early 1946 and concluded with that Norway should establish a national airline. This airline took over the DNL brand and had Balchen as its CEO. Rudolf Olsen retained of the legal successor of DNL, which was named Fre. Olsen Air Transport. The company was formerly incorporated on 16 October 1945, and was the entirety of its existence owned as joint venture between <b>Ganger</b> Rolf and Bonheur.|$|E
25|$|Kjeller Airport was {{the first}} airport {{established}} in Norway. The need for an airport for the Norwegian Army Air Service arose in September 1912, after the first four pilots had been trained and the two first aircraft, Maurice Farman Longhorns, were obtained. Two of the pilots went scouting around Lillestrøm on 8 September to find a suitable location for an air field, and settled on Kjeller {{after two days of}} reconnaissance. The area was selected because of its vicinity to the capital and its flat geography. The first aircraft, <b>Ganger</b> Rolf, was hauled by Kjeller by horse on 14 September, where it was assembled and flew {{for the first time on}} 21 September. Construction of a hangar was subcontracted to Strømmens Trævarefabrik on 13 September, and the structure was completed on 27 September. The first flight to another airport took place on 3 October, when a plan flew to Trondheim, piloted by Einar Sem-Jacobsen, the commander at Kjeller.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1933, the Oslo-based {{shipping}} company Fred.

The foundation of the company was made on 16 October 1933, with Thomas Olsen, Rudolf Olsen, Johan L. Müller, <b>Ganger</b> Rolf and Bonheur—all within the Fred. Olsen sphere—as owners. The airline was established with a share capital of NOK750,000 and took over the former DNL. The new company was named Det Norske Luftfartselskap Fred. Olsen A/S and hired Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen—since 1921 director of the Civil Aviation Council—as managing director. The Olsen brothers and Müller were all elected to the board. The company's initial plans were to gain the operating rights for the airports which were under construction, including Fornebu; Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik; and Stavanger Airport, Sola. The other was receive a state grant to start a service from Oslo, via Kristiansand, to Amsterdam in cooperation with KLM. Domestically, the airline wanted to operate the route from Oslo to Kristiansand and from Kristiansand to Stavanger, Bergen and Ålesund.|$|E

25|$|Fred. Olsen & Co., {{owned by}} the {{brothers}} Thomas Fredrik Olsen and Rudolf Olsen, announced their plans to establish a national airline for Norway in 1933. Founded on 16 October, Norwegian Air Lines was owned by Thomas Olsen, Rudolf Olsen, Johan L. Müller, <b>Ganger</b> Rolf and Bonheur—all within the Fred. Olsen sphere. Named Det Norske Luftfartselskap Fred. Olsen A/S, it hired Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen—since 1921 director of the Civil Aviation Council—as managing director. The company lay plans for both domestic and international routes, which required government concessions with which it had to compete with Widerøe to receive. Fred. Olsen wanted a partner for DNL, in part to strengthen its geographic spread, and meetings were held between Olsen family and Falck to introduce the Bergen-based company {{as a partner in}} DNL. On 7 November 1934, Bergenske Dampskibsselskab (BDS) became a partner in DNL, and the company renamed Det Norske Luftfartselskap Fred. Olsen og Bergenske A/S. The dispute with Widerøe was resolved by DNL buying the former, leaving Fred. Olsen with a forty-percent stake in the new company.|$|E
500|$|Later, the <b>Ganger</b> Doctor has {{met with}} the other Gangers, and discovers their unwillingness to proceed. The <b>Ganger</b> Doctor uses the opportune call of Jimmy's son on his {{birthday}} to convince the <b>Ganger</b> Jimmy and the other Gangers they are just as real as their human counterparts. <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer becomes furious at this display and rages off; the other Gangers agree {{to work with the}} humans to escape the facility. They free the humans trapped in the acid storage room, and race off through the crypts below the monastery, chased by a savage <b>Ganger</b> Jennifer who has transformed herself into a monster. Both <b>Ganger</b> and human sacrifice themselves to stall the monster while letting {{the rest of the group}} escape. They eventually come onto a room where the TARDIS, having been trapped in a pool of acid outside, has fallen into the crypt. <b>Ganger</b> Cleaves offers to hold the door to allow the rest to escape, and the Doctor soon joins her, stunning Amy. To Amy's surprise, the Doctor reveals that he and his <b>Ganger</b> had switched shoes long ago; Amy's distrust of the <b>Ganger</b> was completely misplaced. Amy apologizes to the <b>Ganger</b> Doctor, who accepts but warns her to [...] "push, Amy, but only when she tells you to". As the surviving humans and Gangers escape to the TARDIS, the Cleaves and Doctor Gangers together face the monster, triggering a sonic screwdriver at the right moment to cause them and the monster to dissolve back into liquid.|$|E
500|$|Following from [...] "The Rebel Flesh", the Doctor, Amy, Rory and Foreman Cleaves and {{her staff}} of a {{hazardous}} acid factory housed in an old island monastery have discovered that several [...] "Gangers" [...] of the plant crew exist, created from a living organic liquid called the Flesh {{as a result of}} a recent solar tsunami. The Gangers have turned against their human counterparts, forcing the humans to take shelter in a secured commons area. There, they discover that a <b>Ganger</b> of the Doctor exists, differing only from the real Doctor by his shoes. Though the <b>Ganger</b> Doctor appears ready to help the crew to contact the mainland to request rescue, Amy is distrustful of the being, particularly after it advances on her after she asks about the Doctor's death she witnessed ("The Impossible Astronaut"). Eventually, Cleaves orders the two Doctors separated; the <b>Ganger</b> Doctor and another crewman go looking for Rory, who had gone off alone to find the emotionally distraught Jennifer, another of Cleaves' crew.|$|E

500|$|The actors each {{played their}} {{respective}} Gangers, with prosthetics applied to their faces {{for when the}} duplicates' faces reverted to the original material of the Flesh. Moffat wanted the Gangers to appear like [...] "eyeball matter": white with small capillaries running through them. For the scenes in which both the character and their respective <b>Ganger</b> {{was in the same}} shot, a double for each of the actors was used. Most of the shots showed either the character or their <b>Ganger</b> speaking over their counterpart's shoulder, as only the backs of the doubles' head were made to look similar to the actors.|$|E
500|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor indefinitely stabilizes the Gangers' {{forms to}} ensure that they remain human permanently, while {{providing}} Cleaves with a cure to her terminal condition. He takes the <b>Ganger</b> Jimmy to meet the real Jimmy's son and drops the factory crew at their headquarters where they plan to reveal the truth of the Flesh to humanity. As the TARDIS crew turns to leave, Amy starts feeling contractions. Back aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor admits his trip to the factory was planned: he wanted to investigate the Flesh in its raw form, as he has known for some time that Amy is a <b>Ganger</b> herself. He promises her that he will find her and then disrupts her form, turning her back to raw Flesh. Amy wakes in a pristine white tube; a slot opens on a wall revealing the [...] "Eye Patch Lady", who informs Amy she is [...] "ready to pop, aren't you". Amy looks down at herself, finding herself fully pregnant, and starts entering labour.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{specifically}} asked Graham {{to write}} the episodes about [...] "avatars that rebel", although the Flesh and the monastery were Graham's original ideas. The episode was filmed in the late months of 2010 with some location filming at Caerphilly Castle to represent the monastery. Prosthetics were used to create the Gangers' facial features, while doubles of the actors were used for scenes in which a character {{and his or her}} <b>Ganger</b> were both in a scene, but did not both show their face.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rebel Flesh" [...] and [...] "The Almost People" [...] {{took place}} on 12 November 2010. It was then filmed through November and January 2011. The cold temperatures {{at the time were}} a challenge and caused discomfort. The crew were concerned that the cast, particularly the three lead actors, would fall ill as their costumes were not designed for such weather conditions. Even so, the cast remained healthy. Scenes outside and inside the monastery were filmed at Caerphilly Castle. Other production problems included the director hurting himself and being snowed in. The crypt where the acid container was held was filmed in the same set that had been previously used as the Oval Office in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut"/"Day of the Moon. The actors each played their respective Gangers, with prosthetics applied to their faces for when the duplicates' faces reverted to the original material of the Flesh. For the scenes in which both the character and their respective <b>Ganger</b> was in the same shot, a double for each of the actors was used. Most of the shots showed either the character or their <b>Ganger</b> speaking over their counterpart's shoulder, as only the backs of the doubles' head were made to look similar to the actors. Smith had a voice double and a body double; the former would read the other Doctor's lines on set. The episode also marked the first time Smith wore prosthetic make-up.|$|E
500|$|While {{struggling}} with his past regenerations, the Doctor's <b>Ganger</b> alludes to several previous Doctors' words. He misquotes the First Doctor's line [...] "one day we shall get back... yes, one day" [...] from An Unearthly Child as [...] "one day {{we will get}} back"; quotes the Third Doctor's catchphrase [...] "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow"; and speaks with {{the voices of the}} Fourth and Tenth Doctors (Tom Baker and David Tennant, respectively), the former expressing that Doctor's fondness for jelly babies. Growing frustrated by the humans' distrust of him, the Doctor asks both Amy and Cleaves' Gangers to refer to him as [...] "John Smith". This is an alias the Doctor has used on several occasions, beginning with The Wheel in Space (1968).|$|E
500|$|The cliffhanger {{resolves}} several plot threads {{that had}} been seeded throughout the previous episodes of the series. According to executive producer Beth Willis, the Amy Pond <b>Ganger</b> has been acting {{in place of the}} original Amy Pond {{since the beginning of the}} series. [...] Amy claimed she was pregnant in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", but denied this in the following episode. Since then, the Doctor has performed several inconclusive pregnancy tests on Amy. The Eye Patch Lady, who was later revealed to be named Madame Kovarian in the episode [...] "A Good Man Goes To War", previously made brief appearances in [...] "Day of the Moon", [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", and [...] "The Rebel Flesh".
