5000|$|The Nazi {{movement}} was overtly anti-rationalist, favoring appeals to emotion and cultural myths.

In Mein Kampf, Hitler complained of biased over-education, brainwashing, {{and a lack}} of instinct and will and in many other passages made his anti-intellectual bent clear. Intellectuals were frequently the butts of Hitler's jokes. Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls were overtly instructed to aim for character-building rather than education.

25|$|The {{movement}} {{to commemorate the}} dead only took off when political differences between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans deepened {{in the last years}} of the eighteenth century and the latter took up the question of a memorial in response to the Federalist erection of a statue of George Washington in 1803. The Tammany Society, headed by Benjamin Romaine was created and grew into a Republican organization. On February 10, 1803 Republican Congressman Samuel L. Mitchill asked the federal government to erect a monument to the fallen, but had no success They then turned their efforts to a grand ceremonial re-interment of the prisoners' remains, emphasizing less the construction of a monument than something more suited to the common man. Tammany formed the Wallabout Committee in January 1808. Their efforts took strength <b>from</b> renewed anti-British <b>feeling</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> British incidents in 1806 & 1807. Finally, when President Thomas Jefferson enacted the Embargo Act of 1808, Tammany and the Republicans used their plans for a re-interment as part of their campaign to bolster anti-British sentiment.|$|R

30|$|This universalistic {{tendency}} that enlightenment held in {{its view}} of reason as the source determining one’s self was though questioned yet incorporated by Romanticism. Reason alone cannot be a motive to the will, but rather is the “slave of the passions”. (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy n.d. 2010) What differentiates Romantics from Enlightenment thought is their giving priority to passion over reason. Nonetheless both considered reason essential viable in its instrumental use. On treating the conceptualization of self, Ansari explains the Kantian construction of self as all knowing and based on essential goodness of self “The self, says Kant, does not derive its laws from but prescribe them to nature for it possesses an order which is fixed and immutable in all of us” (Ansari 2004 : 5). This is because in enlightenment thought {{the world is not}} “out there” but “in us” and the individual knows the world because the self determines the structure of his experiences (Ansari 2004 : 5). The world for this self is an object to be defined and to be given form. This self determines structures upon the world in view of whatever way it understands by categorizing sensations to develop relations between and among objects and thus developing concepts through this reasoning. Human experiences and <b>feelings</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> this self which rests upon transcendence of reason as its basic source. Moreover this “transcendental” self is not just the source of knowledge it is the will determining all action and all-knowing and in this sense the transcendental self is consciousness in general (Ansari 2004 : 5). It cannot be known for it is the source and not the object of experience and the recognition of the self requires not knowledge but faith (Ansari 2004 : 5). It is the faith in freedom that encapsulates the essence of the self.|$|R

It appears as a [...] "Power of awfulness" [...] associated with awe or wonder. The objects that possess it impress the observer with [...] "respect, veneration, propitiation, service". These <b>feelings,</b> though subjective, <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the power of the mana. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: [...] "startling manifestations of nature", [...] "curious stones", animals, [...] "human remains", blood, thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and especially the sound of the bullroarer.|$|R
5000|$|Note 3 of the {{standard}} hints that usability addresses aspects of user experience, e.g. [...] "usability criteria {{can be used to}} assess aspects of user experience". The standard does not go further in clarifying the relation between user experience and usability. Clearly, the two are overlapping concepts, with usability including pragmatic aspects (getting a task done) and user experience focusing on users’ <b>feelings</b> <b>stemming</b> both <b>from</b> pragmatic and hedonic aspects of the system. Many practitioners use the terms interchangeably. The term usability pre-dates the term user experience. Part of the reason the terms are often used interchangeably is that, as a practical matter, a user will at minimum require sufficient usability to accomplish a task, while the feelings of the user may be less important, even to the user herself. Since usability is about getting a task done, aspects of user experience like information architecture and user interface can help or hinder a user's experience. If a website has [...] "bad" [...] information architecture and a user has a difficult time finding what they are looking for, then a user will not have an effective, efficient and satisfying search.|$|R
50|$|Hawker and Boulton (2001) {{have used}} the rank theory of {{depression}} to explain the relationship between forms of victimization and types of maladjustment. According to the rank theory, internalizing problems such as depression are linked {{to a sense of}} powerlessness and of not belonging. Those who are physically victimized suffer from low resource-holding potential, which works in part to delineate social power in peer groups, while relational victimization directly affects children’s sense of belonging instead. In addition, according so Social Rank Theory, jeopardization of one’s <b>feeling</b> of belonging <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> relational victimization should play a greater part in perpetuating depression than that of resource-holding potential as in physical victimization. Therefore, depression should correlate more strongly with relational victimization as opposed to physical victimization.|$|R
50|$|Viktor Frankl {{believed}} depression {{occurred at}} the psychological, physiological, and spiritual levels. At the psychological level, he believed that <b>feelings</b> of inadequacy <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> undertaking tasks beyond our abilities. At the physiological level, he recognized a “vital low”, which he defined as a “diminishment of physical energy”. Finally, Frankl believed that at the spiritual level, the depressed man faces tension between who he actually is in relation to what he should be. Frankl refers to this as the gaping abyss. Finally Frankl suggests that if goals seem unreachable, an individual loses a sense of future and thus meaning resulting in depression. Thus logotherapy aims “to change the patient’s attitude toward their disease as well as toward their life as a task”.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the function of emotion in the social formation of the believers in the Pauline churches. In his letters, Paul speaks often of his own emotions, and also promotes certain emotions while banishing others; all this surely indicates that emotion has an important role to play within the believing community. However, in New Testament studies, the study of emotion is still at an embryonic stage. This thesis, which represents the first thesis-length treatment of emotion in the Pauline letter corpus, attempts to take the discussion forward. It argues that for Paul, emotions are integral to the proper formation and stabilizing of Christian identity and community, because they encode structures of belief and influence patterns of sociality. Chapter 1 reviews the nascent scholarship on emotion in Paul’s letters and the wider New Testament, and also surveys the state of play of emotions research in the sciences and social sciences. In chapter 2, we examine emotion in Stoicism, the dominant philosophical influence of the day, focusing particularly on joy and grief—the two emotions that we take up and investigate exegetically in chapters 3 and 4, which concern, respectively, joy in Philippians, and grief in 1 Thessalonians. Finally, in chapter 5, we enlist the sociological notion of the “emotional regime” to explore how authorized emotions are constructed and reinforced in the Pauline communities. I conclude by offering an account of emotion in Paul, contrasting it with Stoic thinking. Taking its cue from current emotions research, which highlights the cognitive and social dimensions of emotion, this thesis proposes that as Paul sees it, right patterns of <b>feeling</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from,</b> and indeed embody, right patterns of belief, and that the social display of sanctioned emotions upbuilds the communal life of the believers. Furthermore, such right emotions, by squaring felt experience with held beliefs, and demarcating social boundaries between Christians and others, have powerful integrating and differentiating functions that profoundly influence identity and belonging. These conclusions have potentially far-reaching implications for our overall understanding of the social formation of the early believers, not least in terms of how a hitherto neglected aspect of that socialization—Paul’s emphasis on the affective dimensions of personal and communal life—is brought into active conversation with the theological realities that were believed to shape all of human existence and the practices that undergirded and sustained these beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of emotion in an ethical {{consumption}} context. It responds to a call by many researchers for greater knowledge of ethical issues {{in the field of}} marketing and consumer behaviour. This interest has emerged from a growth in ethical consumption practices despite hard economic times. The limitations of the renowned intention-behaviour gap highlight that such practices cannot be wholly explained by rational processes alone. However, little attention has been afforded to the impact of non-rational factors such as emotion. By examining the concept of emotion, this study addresses previously ignored consumption phenomena identified in the experiential perspective of consumer behaviour. More specifically, this thesis concentrates on tourism as an experiential consumption encounter and as a prototypical moral platform on which ethical practices has resulted in a plethora of alternative tourism offerings. This study employs semi-structured interviews with self-defined ethical tourists using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach. This approach helped uncover participants' subjective experiences, their meaning and how they make sense of these encounters. The findings of this thesis demonstrate the difficulties experienced by the participants in communicating emotional experiences. As a result, they tended to use the senses to describe these encounters, thereby reflecting deeply engaging and emotional consumption experiences. The pivotal role emotion plays in the participants' ethical decision making is evident as it helps reaffirm an ethical sense of self, thereby influencing future ethical behaviours. Within the consumption experience, emotion appeared as a source of hedonic value often expressed through escape experiences and its concomitant feelings of freedom, through a sense of mutual benefit and in the challenge and achievement bestowed in the experience itself. Furthermore, the relationship between positive and negative emotions is evident highlighting the transformational effect of positive emotions and the influential impact of negative emotions on ethical consumption choices. The main contributions of this study are threefold. First, it contributes to the ethical literature by demonstrating ethical consumption to be a hedonic experience. It highlights emotion's key function in motivating, influencing, evaluating and engaging the participants with their consumption experiences. In particular, it contributes to the literature on ethical tourism as it highlights that the participants' desire to engage in ethical tourism is not only motivated by self-reflection based on their ethical beliefs and values, but also because of how these experiences make them feel. These <b>feelings</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> an intrinsic enjoyment bestowed in choosing an ethical alternative and in the experience itself. Consequently, ethical tourism is regarded as a superior quality experience and a more meaningful consumption encounter. Second, this thesis contributes to the experiential perspective of consumer behaviour, by providing a greater understanding of the concept of emotion in an ethical consumption context. It identifies the central role of emotion prior to, during, and after decision-making in an ethical context. In addition, it demonstrates the motivational and influential role positive emotion has in promoting ethical behaviour, and the reinforcing role negative emotion has in discouraging unethical behaviour. Third, the thesis highlights the significance of pride as a consumption emotion, due to its impact on both a personal and an emotional level, and its ability to influence the individual's ethical decision-making processes. Finally, as a research context, the practical implications of this thesis are evident in their ability to influence marketing strategies employed in the tourism industry and their role in inform policy-makers is illustrated. Implications for future research are also considered...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Occupational {{therapists}} have {{an important}} role to play in working with people with high cervical spinal cord injury who have severe activity and participation limitations. Although the benefits of environmental control systems (ECS) have been identified (Rigby et al., 2005) there is little understanding of {{what it is like to}} live with an ECS. This study seeks to provide an insider’s perspective on living with ECS and to enhance a clientcentred approach amongst occupational therapists. Methods: Following ethics approval, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with six purposefully selected people at the end of an 8 -week trial using an ECS starter pack. Interviews were video recorded following informed participant consent. Anonymised verbatim transcripts were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis IPA (Smith et al., 2009). Results: The experience of living with an ECS starter pack was described by participants as “taking back a little of what is lost”. Themes of “reclaiming some doing” as well as “feeling enabled” were also identified and supported by verbatim quotations. Impact for service users: The ECS provided experiences of doing and feeling things that had been lost as a result of disability. The “little” that was reclaimed was highly significant given the extent of occupational deprivation and <b>feelings</b> of dependence <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> injury. Implications for occupational therapy: This insider’s perspective highlights the role that ECS can play in achieving occupational therapy goals by facilitating a person’s ability to do and thereby improving participation in occupations and feelings of enablement...|$|R

The experiences and personal accounts presented in this study provide insights into {{what it was like to}} be a first-generation college student from a blue collar background in the 1960 's and 1970 's in the United States. Three key themes emerged. The first theme that emerged provided insights into the roots of the belief that all of the participants experienced alienation. The sources of these <b>feelings</b> of alienation <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> family opposition, institutional indifference, limited choice for college majors, gender stereotypes, and cultural/class differences. The result was that the participants believed that they needed to balance two cultures, and alienation resulted. The second theme that emerged provided crucial insight into the precarious nature of the perception of self that was expressed by the participants. The participants indicated that although their self-perception changed and became stronger, at times their self-image was very low. These beliefs <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> two sources. The first source was that all of the participants believed that they were inferior to what many labeled as "the real college students. " The second source was the fact that all of the participants had to pay for their college education and very often did not have enough money to pay for the high costs of college and the necessities of life. Once again, because money was not in abundance, the participants believed that they were less than those of perceived privilege. The third theme that emerged was an evolution toward personal empowerment. Factors that contributed to this empowerment were crucial turning points in the participants' lives, self-sought mentors and support groups, and personal, self-directed action plans. An examination of these themes revealed an inter-relation among them, and a process emerged. The process included five clearly recognizable stages. The stages were: (1) risk-taking; (2) rejection; (3) reticence; (4) reflection; and (5) resolve.

Content and discourse analysis were the research tools used for looking at the stories. Content {{analysis was used to}} seek out the learning environments and focuses, and established what were typical and untypical accounts in each environment and focus. Discourse analysis was used to establish how difficulties in different school subjects were expressed, how the learning society was structured in the stories, and how the learner conceived of her/himself in relation to the teacher, the school subject and other pupils. It was also used to see how different discourse was actualised and modified within individual accounts of different school subjects and different learning environments. School did not emerge as a particularly memorable environment in the learning experiences. Only 44 % of the memoirs concentrated on learning in school, despite the fact that in five out of the seven rounds of collecting material people were specifically asked to write in the first instance about learning in school. There were differences in the discourse of the memoirs according to the school subject being described, but the central messages that rose above the specific subjects were showing, the instrument value of learning, hierarchy, competition, lack of time, and external definitions of time. These messages were repeated in memoirs written by both men and women, although the stories otherwise did differ according to gender. Many memorable learning experiences were not particularly meaningful from the learning perspective. Meaningful learning required confidence in one's own abilities, boldness to step into an uncertain world, and a desire to learn. It was also characterised by a sense of challenge, testing one's independence in relation to the experts in the actual teaching process, a sense of security in relation to external threats, a lack of hurry yet accompanied by time limits, and rather than a need to show, a need to use what was being learned. The research material contain many such stories that left a negative feeling. However, along with the negative memoirs, there were some descriptions of extremely positive learning experiences. One group of positive accounts was formed from those who spoke of an excellent teacher. Positive <b>feelings</b> also <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> exceptional circumstances allowing one to make an effort, or from succeeding in showing just what one can do.

SMI is described as a worrisome and invasive cultural construct, because of its unfathomable. These emotional factors are further deteriorated by the cultural representation of mental disorders in a disadvantaged district, which magnifies experiences of loneliness, stigma and shame. We highlight the importance that services could be enhanced by shared specific care practices, in a multidisciplinary team, for caregivers and their relative living in disadvantaged communities. It is paramount to promote processes of elaboration and comprehension of SMI and reshape the dynamics of mutual control present in the caregiverrelative relationship, and also to support their feelings of loneliness related to high levels of social stigma typical of suburbs, in both the therapeutic setting and the integration with the local community...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the Workplace Challenge, a County Sport Partnership led physical activity programme which utilises a website designed to engage people from workplaces in physical activity. The Workplace Challenge operated within the geographical boundary of Lincolnshire and thus targeted workplaces within this region. The overarching aim of the Workplace Challenge was to enact culture change within organisations in terms of employees’ physical activity habits. Methods A methods-driven, Programme Evaluation model was adopted which utilised qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Qualitative data was obtained from three case studies of different groups engaged in the Workplace Challenge: A workplace from the private sector, a workplace from the public sector, and individual participants {{who took part in the}} programme but were either not associated to a workplace or were the sole representative from their workplace. Purposive samples of participants were selected from each case study who completed a semi structured interview regarding the programme, with results analysed via thematic analysis to highlight common themes. Quantitative analysis was conducted utilising the information stored on the Workplace Challenge website and using a computer script developed with MATLAB®, (MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA). Key Findings Key qualitative findings related to the social networks and relationships which operated during the programme and how these influenced programme delivery and uptake. The presence of a key programme driver within a workplace appeared crucial to the successful delivery of the programme; ensuring employees were informed, motivated and connected throughout the programme. Team bonding and intra-workplace competition were prominent outcomes of the programme, with competition motivating increases in physical activity levels amongst many individuals. Feelings of isolation were also apparent from individuals engaged in the programme who felt unconnected to a wider team, as well as negative <b>feelings</b> which <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> an individual comparing their physical captivity levels to a more active peer. With reference to the Workplace Challenge programme, responses indicated that the active transport element of the programme was unknown by many individuals, as well as the fact the programme website was staying live after the completion of the challenge. There also existed ambiguity over how to classify exercise intensity on the Workplace Challenge website. Key quantitative findings indicated the varied level of engagement which was apparent from individuals involved in the programme, with a large range of website activity entries being recorded and significant variations in durations of activity completed. The average number of modes of activity completed per participant was low indicating that individuals preferred to undertake a few chosen activities as opposed to the programme encouraging new activity forms...|$|R
