5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire. Various {{estimates}} have put its age at between 2,000 and 5,000 years; recent research into yew tree ages suggests that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be nearer the lower limit of 2,000 years. This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The white, porous {{hymenium}} has a {{thickness of}} 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per millimeter, {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the mycorrhiza {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be ectomycorrhizal.|$|E

5|$|Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it {{occurring}} under larch (Larix), oak, pine, birch {{and other}} introduced trees in South Australia in 1934, {{and it has}} subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under introduced birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in Chile. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to its mass <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E

The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|The African species' {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting {{grounds of the}} white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed {{is assumed to be}} in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed-beds for the night-time roost.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower {{than that of a}} typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E

5|$|The estuary stingray's diminished {{population}} and susceptibility to multiple threats {{have led the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Vulnerable. Demographic modelling has shown that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become Endangered without intervention. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are located within its range, but at present they lack adequate protection from fishing. As this ray remains locally abundant in Hervey Bay and parts of Moreton Bay, these areas may become important centers for preserving the species. The Queensland government has listed the estuary stingray on the Back on Track species prioritisation framework, to facilitate the development of conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation from the Neolithic period in Cheddar. Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. There is some evidence of a Bronze Age field system at the Batts Combe quarry site. There is also evidence of Bronze Age barrows at the mound in the Longwood valley, which if man-made <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be a field system. The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in {{the grounds of the}} current vicarage.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have}} been introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman conquest, William the Conqueror {{granted the}} Earldom of Lancaster to Roger de Poictou {{who in turn}} granted the barony of Widnes to Yorfrid. Yorfrid had no sons and his elder {{daughter}} married William FitzNigel, the second Baron of Halton. On Yorfrid's death the barony of Widnes passed to that of Halton. The current St. Luke's, a Norman church, was built in Farnworth. Its date of origin is uncertain but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be around 1180. In 1500 the South Chapel {{was added to the}} church and in 1507 a grammar school was established in Farnworth; both were endowments from Bishop William Smyth. Until the middle of the 19th century the area consisted of the scattered hamlets of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton, Upton and Woodend. Nearby were the villages of Cronton and Cuerdley.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there {{does not seem to}} be any authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E
