In this paper, three testing approaches based on the properties of semiparametric estimators of the fractional differencing parameter, d, are described and applied to the (log) <b>Ireland-United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> and Ireland-Germany real exchange rates. The two exchange rates behave quite differently over time and the new tests give different results for each; but overall the results provide fairly {{strong support for the}} possibility of nonlinearity rather than long memory...|$|E
