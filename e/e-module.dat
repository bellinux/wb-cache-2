Let M be a right R module and give M the natural left <b>E-module</b> structure, where E is End(M), {{the ring of}} endomorphisms of the abelian group M. Every map mr given by mr(x) = xr creates an {{additive}} endomorphism of M, that is, an element of E. The map r → mr is a ring homomorphism of R into the ring E, and we denote the image of R inside of E by RM. It can be checked that the kernel of this canonical map is the annihilator Ann(MR). Therefore, by an isomorphism theorem for rings, RM is isomorphic to the quotient ring R/Ann(MR). Clearly when M is a faithful module, R and RM are isomorphic rings.|$|E

Participants completed questionnaires on cognitive load and motivation. After a 4 -week study period, blinded assessors rated students’ cognitive emergency care skills in two mannequin-based scenarios. In total 61 students participated and were assessed; 16 control group students, 20 cases students and 25 game students. Learning time was 2 h longer for the cases and game groups than for the control group. Acquired cognitive skills did not differ between groups. The game group experienced higher intrinsic and germane cognitive load than the cases group (p = 0. 03 and 0. 01) and felt more engaged (p < 0. 001).

40|$|It’s {{first part}} {{describes}} the noise performances of an inexpensive instrument for seismic data collection; the geophone-based seismograph {{used in the}} SEIS-SCHOOL network and now called Cossac Ranger. The analysis of its properties such as the transfer function and the thermal stability is given. A theoretical model for the instrumental noise calculation is proposed and then the instrumental noise RMS spectral density curves are calculated. Based on the obtained noise level it is concluded that {{the performance of the}} geophone-based seismograph is comparable to that of a standard short period seismometer. Further, {{it was found that the}} instrumental noise at frequencies below 10 Hz is mainly generated by the operational amplifier circuits. According to the above analysis three alternative preamplifier design solutions were proposed and analyzed. One of them showed better noise performances then those of the original design. The new design also forwards a simplification of the assembling process of the preamplifier. In Appendix A a set of equations for a geophone transfer function and impedance is developed. Appendix B presents theory of operation of the over-damping preamplifier. A theoretical model for calculation of the instrumental noise of the preamplifier is highlighted in Appendix C. The second part of the thesis is devoted to electronic learning technologies. It highlights the conceptual design of the SEIS-SCHOOL project e-learning modules and gives a brief description of its practical application. It starts with an overview of available Web-technologies for creation of advanced electronic learning modules.

The current paper outlines and examines a personalized prompting approach aimed at eliminating performance differences {{on the basis of}} a number of learner characteristics (capturing learning strategies and traits). The learner characteristics of interest were the need for cognition, work effort, computer self-efficacy, the use of surface learning, and the learner’s confidence in their learning. The approach was tested in two <b>e-modules,</b> using similar assessment forms (experimental n = 413; control group n = 243). Several prompts which corresponded to the learner characteristics were implemented, including an explanation prompt, a motivation prompt, a strategy prompt, and an assessment prompt.

30|$|The medical {{students}} we questioned were not impressed by freely available e-learning modules {{and over a}} third of third year students had no exposure to online modules. This shows that either students have difficulties in finding appropriate web-based training resources themselves or the existing <b>e-modules</b> do not match the training needs of students. Many radiology resources are aimed at radiologists or postgraduate trainees. Furthermore, many of the existing teaching websites are somewhat dated, do not contain interactive elements and the quality of x-rays is not always comparable to digital PACS images that students are used to seeing on the wards. It is of some concern that students are relying on generic search engines such as Google and open access websites like Wikipedia to identify learning resources. This suggests that guidance should be offered to students to help them find suitable teaching websites. Alternatively dedicated e-learning modules have to be developed at the university hospitals where students receive training, an undertaking that we have not yet successfully completed ourselves.|$|R

He shows that one may realize an injective resolution and construct a spectral sequence for E∗ (∏ i Xi) with E 2 -term given by the derived functors of the E∗E-comodule product of the E∗(Xi). When E = E(n) and the Xi are E-local, the spectral sequence has a horizontal vanishing line at some stage and converges strongly. Furthermore, the derived functors can be calculated by relative injectives, and hence if the Xi are <b>E-modules,</b> the spectral sequence collapses, which shows that E∗ (∏ i Xi) is the E∗E-comodule product of the E∗(Xi) ...|$|R
