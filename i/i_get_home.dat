500|$|All of {{the songs}} on A Lesson in Romantics were written while touring after Warped Tour. The songs are about: [...] "being in a {{relationship}} while you're on the road, and the different hardships that come with that." [...] Unlike the band's EP, the album was [...] "more put together" [...] and [...] "more organized", according to Garcia. Sanders thought it stood up [...] "pretty well" [...] to the EP, noting that it was [...] "just as catchy [...] ", but [...] "more powerful." [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was originally recorded by Kid Named Chicago, Lancaster's previous band. Sanders claimed the song was [...] "kind of a tough one to choose" [...] because the band {{had a lot of}} new material to choose from, but felt [...] "pretty happy" [...] with its inclusion. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Home,</b> You're So Dead" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs the band wrote. According to Garcia, the final track was called [...] "You Be the Anchor That Keeps My Feet on the Ground, I'll Be the Wings That Keep Your Heart in the Clouds" [...] because the band was [...] "trying to be poetic".|$|E

500|$|Lancaster {{left the}} band in March 2007 citing {{a lack of}} writing credit on the band's releases. Lenzo and Bundrick filled in for Lancaster's vocals, while Garcia and Betts {{performed}} Lancaster's guitar parts. Garcia said this change made the guitars [...] "sound more clear" [...] and not [...] "clutter"; on the other hand, the group found it hard working out who should sing Lancaster's parts. Lancaster's departure hurt Sanders personally as [...] "he was a good friend". Later that month, the band supported Plain White T's on their U.S. tour. On April 4, [...] "Black Cat" [...] was made available for streaming via Hot Topic's Myspace profile. On April 13, the release of A Lesson in Romantics was announced.

500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

2500|$|Glenn Danzig {{has served}} as the sole {{songwriter}} for every band he has fronted, and described his writing process: [...] "Sometimes I get the guitar lines, sometimes I write on the piano, sometimes I’ll write the lyrics first and then figure out the chord patterns on guitar, and sometimes I write the drum pattern first. It's all different". Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: [...] "I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> and work it out on guitar or piano".|$|E
