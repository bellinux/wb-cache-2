The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper.

5000|$|A hoard of {{gold and}} silver objects was found in 1812, {{supposedly}} near Backworth and, according to Haverfield, was sold to a Newcastle silversmith. He resold [...] "all, or nearly all" [...] to Mr. J. Brumell, a Newcastle collector, from whom most of the objects passed in 1850 to the British Museum. The hoard consisted of: a silver skillet in which were a pair of silver-gilt trumpet brooches, one silver and five gold rings, one gold bracelet, two gold chains with wheel-shaped pendant, and a crescent attached, three silver spoons, another silver skillet, 280+ Roman denarii, and two first brass coins of Antoninus Pius. A white bronze mirror {{had served as a}} cover. The date of deposition is thought likely to be A.D. 140. The <b>larger</b> <b>skillet</b> and one of the gold rings each have an inscription, a dedication to the mother-goddesses. This list does not wholly accord with Haverfield's: in particular he suggests that an oval silver dish 18 inches long and 2 pieces of a silver bridle bit never reached the British Museum.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of {{syndicated}} loan markets in financial market development in 24 European countries. We find credit spreads to be negatively related to market size in small markets and positively related <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets. Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> <b>large</b> versus small financial systems. In small markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. In small markets, they transfer external finance across borders and <b>in</b> <b>large</b> markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks <b>in</b> small versus <b>large</b> markets differ considerably...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of stone collection and stone theft by breeding Chinstrap penguins was measured, and estimations {{made of the}} number of stones per nest <b>in</b> <b>large</b> (> 400 nests) and small subcolonies (< 50 nests) <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> Vapour Col colony on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. Stone availability was significantly higher both inside and outside small subcolonies. Penguins carried stones to the nest at the same rate <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, but stole more intensively <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies. Stones obtained by theft were significantly larger than those collected elsewhere. When stone availability was increased experimentally, individuals of large subcolonies collected more intensively than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, and stole significantly less than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies, and as much as individuals in small subcolonies. The greater theft pressure <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies was accompanied by more aggressive defence by nest owners and by reduced succession stealing. However, the reduced availability of stones on the ground near large subcolonies led to a significantly lower number of stones per nest than in small subcolonies. These results are interpreted {{in the light of the}} geometric effects of breeding group size (perimeter to surface ratio) on stone accessibility. © 1995 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

30|$|The {{location}} also positively moderates {{the relation}} between EO and venture performance. Firms located <b>in</b> the <b>larger</b> city are more innovative, proactive, competitive and autonomous than firms established in regional towns. These are because of high competition <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> city, which encourage firms to innovate {{a new way of}} doing things and technology that helps to produce new products, and to search for new markets. A risk is associated with activities that have good promise to return. As a result, firms <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities are more autonomous and risk takers. In general, firms involved with the manufacturing sector and adopting strong EO tend to perform more than their relatives. Besides, firms located <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities that adopt EO grow much better than enterprises established in regional towns. More specifically, the performance of ventures <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities is better than the ventures in regional towns because of the better practice of EO <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities.|$|R
