25|$|Oddly enough, this Baldrick {{seems to}} have a bit of the idiot savant in him; Baldrick's explanation, {{although}} heard from someone else, of why George and Blackadder will be able to trade places is surprisingly smart and articulate, suggesting he might have an amazing memory with words, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand what they mean.|$|E

25|$|The bishop or eparch of a see, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not also}} hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is {{the centre of}} unity for his diocese or eparchy, and, {{as a member of}} the College of Bishops, shares in {{responsibility}} for governance of the whole Church (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.|$|E
500|$|Late in July, he {{attached}} {{himself to}} [...] "the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles 'Buck' Lanham, as it drove toward Paris", and Hemingway became de facto leader {{to a small}} band of village militia in Rambouillet outside of Paris. Of Hemingway's exploits, World WarII historian Paul Fussell remarks: [...] "Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it well". This was in fact in contravention of the Geneva Convention, [...] and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said that he [...] "beat the rap" [...] by claiming that he only offered advice.|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg {{called the}} use of Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] in the episode [...] "completely out of place", and Sullivan {{characterized}} its inclusion as [...] "barely justified". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal pointed out that both Criss and McHale had major roles in Perry's video of the song, and the Glee performance [...] "winks at [...] fact". West was annoyed by Finn's recent tendency to [...] "succumb" [...] to his less nice and less responsible side as exemplified in the episode by his failure to [...] "stand up for Rory" [...] and for blasting [...] "Brittany's simple, goofy belief system", <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> eventually do the right thing.|$|E

500|$|Timicin's {{analysis}} of the failed test turns up some promising options, but if he follows through with the Resolution, no one will have his experience and knowledge to carry on his work to save his world. [...] Concerned, Timicin requests asylum on the Enterprise {{so that he can}} renounce the Resolution and continue his research. [...] B'Tardat (Terrence E. McNally), the Science Minister on Kaelon II, is outraged after learning of Timicin's request for asylum, and he sends up two warships to ensure that the Enterprise does not leave the system with Timicin on board. As Picard orders the bridge crew to analyze the offensive capabilities of the Kaelonian ships, Timicin realizes that his situation is not as simple as he had hoped, for his home planet will not accept any further reports from him, and he is told that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> find a solution, they will not accept it.|$|E

While packing their luggage for the trip home, Noriko asks her father why they cannot simply stay as they are now, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> remarry – she cannot imagine herself any happier than living with {{and taking care of}} him. Shukichi admonishes her, saying that she must embrace the new life she will build with Satake, one in which he, Shukichi, will have no part, because [...] "that’s the order of human life and history." [...] Noriko asks her father’s forgiveness for her [...] "selfishness" [...] and agrees {{to go ahead with the}} marriage.|$|E

During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it. Three Jewish officials – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue. As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: [...] "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.

2500|$|A {{person who}} waters and cares for the Tulsi daily is {{believed}} to gain moksha (salvation) and the divine grace of Vishnu, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not worship it. Traditionally, the daily worship and care of the plant {{is the responsibility of}} the women of the household. The plant is regarded as a [...] "women's deity" [...] and a [...] "symbol of ideal wifehood and motherhood". Though daily worship is prescribed, Tuesdays and Fridays are considered especially sacred for Tulsi worship. Rituals involve watering the plant, cleaning the area near the plant with water and cow dung (considered sacred) and making offerings of food, flowers, incense, Ganges water etc. Rangoli (decorative designs) of deities and saints are drawn near its foot. Devotees pray to Tulsi and circumbulate it,chanting mantras. The Tulsi plant is often worshipped twice in a day: in the morning and in the evening, when a lamp or candle is lit near the plant.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{currently}} in the Western Church the title [...] "abbot" [...] is given only abbots of monasteries, the title archimandrite is given to [...] "monastics" [...] (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of monsignor in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the Orthodox Church, only monastics are permitted to be elevated {{to the rank of}} archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of Archpriest or Protopresbyter. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been widowed. Since the time of Catherine II the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.|$|E

[...] In the later reign of Darius, Daniel’s refusal to give up private prayer to God and pray to the king instead results in him receiving a death sentence: being thrown into the lions’ den. [...] According to the Book of Daniel, an angel comes and shuts the mouths of the lions so that Daniel is spared and rescued by the king himself the following morning.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{his move}} to Atlético Madrid, Sky Sports analyst Adam Bate {{wrote that he}} was the perfect fit for manager Diego Simeone's style as Mandžukić is 'often the {{instigator}} of the press with his energetic running, Mandzukic battles defences, driving them back to create space for teammates as well as preventing opponents building patiently without pressure on the ball.' Bate further added that the Croatian 'is both a physical and mobile striker who does so much of his best work without the ball, seemingly doing the work of two players and thus allowing an extra man in midfield.' ESPN FC contributor Michael Cox has also praised Mandžukić for his excellent team-work, highlighting that while he presses his opponents energetically when they attempt to play the ball out from the back, he is also extremely diligent and disciplined {{in the manner in which}} he drops back into his own half to defend behind the ball if his opponents manage to bypass his team's pressing. In 2014, Aleksandar Holiga commented on Mandžukić's playing, stating that [...] "e stretches the defences with constant movement and seemingly endless stamina, opening space for others to come from behind or cut inside from the wing; his pressing on the ball has proven decisive on a number of previous occasions and he is, of course, one of the best strikers in the world when it comes to aerial power. So <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not score himself, his presence could be key for the team’s chances.|$|E
