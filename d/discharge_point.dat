5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment <b>discharge</b> <b>point.</b> Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E

25|$|Agricultural {{pollution}} {{refers to}} biotic and abiotic byproducts of farming practices {{that result in}} contamination or {{degradation of the environment}} and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests. The pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from point source pollution (from a single <b>discharge</b> <b>point)</b> to more diffuse, landscape-level causes, also known as non-point source pollution.

Management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of pesticides and fertilizers in global agricultural practices.|$|E

5000|$|The As River {{is one of}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>points</b> for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. [...] As of 2004, 18 {{cubic meters}} of water was {{released}} per second, and the river's flow is consequently not seasonally variable.|$|R
25|$|As the Long Prairie River {{watershed}} was settled, {{roads and}} railroads {{took over the}} job of transportation and shipping. Landowners used the river {{as a source of}} water for themselves, their livestock, and more recently, for irrigation. Industry located along the riverbanks and used the river as a source of water and as a <b>discharge</b> <b>point</b> for the waste materials generated by their companies. Few cities and villages used the river for drinking water, because the shallow sand aquifer along the river provided easy access to well water. Wastewater, however, was and still is discharged to the river and to Eagle Creek, one of the larger tributaries.|$|E
2500|$|In {{comment on}} the Komatsu analysis, Atwater’s team {{observed}} that there is substantial evidence for multiple large floods, including evidence of mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers which were filled by sediment from later floods. Further, evidence for multiple flood flows up side arms of Glacial Lake Columbia spread over many centuries have been found. [...] They {{also pointed out that}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>point</b> from Lake Columbia varied with time, originally flowing across the Waterville Plateau into Moses Coulee but later, when the Okanagon lobe blocked that route, eroding the Grand Coulee to discharge there as a substantially lower outlet. The Komatsu analysis does not evaluate the impact of the considerable erosion observed in this basin during the flood (or floods) – hence the assumption that the flood hydraulics can be modeled using modern-day topography is an area which warrants further consideration – earlier narrower constrictions at places such as Wallula Gap and through the Columbia Gorge could be expected to produce higher flow resistance and correspondingly higher floods.|$|E
2500|$|Vegetation {{was turned}} yellow {{as far back}} as [...] from the front line.

A potentially lethal concentration for an unmasked person extended for [...] from the <b>discharge</b> <b>point</b> and about [...] donned gas helmets during the attack, including many {{on the outskirts of the}} cloud, who wore helmets as a precaution. Troops in the front line received little warning before the gas arrived. In places the cloud was seen to rise from the German trenches as a white mist and hissing was audible at some points but was drowned by rifle and machine-gun fire elsewhere. In the north, the opposing trenches were [...] apart and the gas cloud arrived in seconds, highly concentrated. The standard anti-gas equipment of PH helmets and [...] "box respirators" [...] for machine-gunners, signallers and some artillery personnel had been issued. The box respirator was a great success, because the face piece could be fitted quicker than the PH helmet.|$|E

40|$|The INEEL {{contractors}} and their associated facilities {{are required to}} identify all liquid effluent discharges that may impact the environment at the INEEL. This liquid effluent information is then placed in the Liquid Effluent Inventory (LEI) database, which is maintained by the INEEL prime contractor. The purpose of the LEI is to identify and maintain a current listing of all liquid effluent <b>discharge</b> <b>points</b> and to identify which discharges are subject to federal, state, or local permitting or reporting requirements and DOE order requirements. Initial characterization, which represents most of the INEEL liquid effluents, has been performed, and additional characterization may be required {{in the future to}} meet regulations. LEI information is made available to persons responsible for or concerned with INEEL compliance with liquid effluent permitting or reporting requirements, such as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, Wastewater Land Application, Storm Water Pollution Prevention, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures, and Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment. The State of Idaho Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Program also needs the information for tracking liquid effluent discharges at the INEEL. The information provides a baseline from which future liquid discharges can be identified, characterized, and regulated, if appropriate.

40|$|Previous {{methods for}} {{estimating}} the charge transferred to earth by <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> are reviewed. It is concluded that <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> on trees may well make a large {{contribution to this}} transfer of charge but that no reliable method of measurement has previously been duvised. A laboratory study of the pulsed nature of the <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> currents produced at metal points and natural points has been made. It is concluded from these measurements that the amplitude and repetition frequency of these current pulses {{can be used to}} give the total discharge current. A new method for measuring <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> currents in trees has now been developed and the apparatus successfully calibrated. This {{takes the form of a}} capacitative electrode, attached to a branch at the top of a tree, which detects pulses of <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> current in the tree. The electrode is connected to an electronic pulse detector which gives a measure of the <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> current in the tree. Measurements of <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> currents have been made in two trees over a period of three months in a plantation of conifers in Weardale. The potential gradient and the <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> current through a metal point were measured outside the plantation over a period of eleven months. The charge transferred to earth by <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> on one tree in three months was found to be 4. 3 x 10 (^- 4) C whereas for the metal point in the same period the charge transferred was 72 x 10 (^- 4) C. It is concluded that this difference is a result of the higher potential gradients necessary to initiate <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> on the tree compared with those for the metal <b>point.</b> The <b>point</b> <b>discharge</b> measurements for two trees, one on the edge and one inside the plantation, are compared and found to be of similar magnitudes.
