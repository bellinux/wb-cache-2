5|$|A legend <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> England {{would not}} fall {{to a foreign}} invader {{as long as there}} were ravens at the Tower of London; {{although}} this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E
5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> is significantly less computationally intensive. The strategy begins {{by analyzing the}} permutations of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence class for the partial solutions are identified, the completions of the lower two bands are constructed and counted for each equivalence class.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{development}} of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons {{were found to be}} hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} video games have been <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> tie to the Yu Yu Hakusho series, {{most of which}} have been {{produced}} for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only saw three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, Yū Yū Hakusho: Makyō Tōitsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters. When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: , an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; , a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and , a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28.

5|$|A {{technique}} was <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|From the Early Preclassic, Maya {{society was}} sharply {{divided between the}} elite and commoners. As {{population}} increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex. By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied. A middle class may have <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> included artisans, low ranking priests and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves. According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or clans. Such clans held that the land was {{the property of the}} clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Harries left Granada {{and moved}} into {{freelance}} producing and directing. He directed the documentary series Africa in 1984 before beginning a collaboration with Paul Yule, with whom he made four films in Peru between 1985 and 1989—Martin Chambi and the Heirs of the Incas, Our God the Condor, Iquitos, and Mario Vargas Llosa: The Novelist Who Would Be President—and working on editions of The South Bank Show and Arena. While directing a corporate video for BT he met Jonathan Ross, who was his assistant for the day. Ross invited Harries to direct a pilot for a chat show he and Alan Marke had <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> was based on Late Night with David Letterman. The pilot was a success and Ross found a television audience with The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross, which first aired in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, heat-seeking {{missiles}} were <b>developed</b> <b>that</b> had a range {{greater than the}} visual acuity of pilots. Aircraft camouflage now had two major threats {{that it was not}} able to fully defeat—radar and infrared detection. Camouflage accordingly became less important. However, by the 1980s, aircraft such as the ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) were painted in camouflage schemes that included both disruptive ground coloration and automimicry (deceptive self-imitation), {{in the form of a}} false canopy on the underside.|$|E
