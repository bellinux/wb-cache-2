2500|$|After the war, {{two studies}} of the {{repatriation}} of American prisoners of war by Robert Lifton and by Edgar Schein concluded that brainwashing (called [...] "thought reform" [...] by Lifton and [...] "coercive persuasion" [...] by Schein) had a transient effect. Both researchers found that the Chinese mainly used coercive persuasion to disrupt {{the ability of the}} prisoners to organize and maintain morale and hence to escape. By placing the prisoners under conditions of physical and social deprivation and disruption, and then by offering them more comfortable situations such as better sleeping quarters, better <b>food,</b> <b>warmer</b> clothes or blankets, the Chinese did succeed in getting some of the prisoners to make anti-American statements. Nevertheless, the majority of prisoners did not actually adopt Communist beliefs, instead behaving as though they did {{in order to avoid the}} plausible threat of extreme physical abuse. Both researchers also concluded that such coercive persuasion succeeded only on a minority of POWs, and that the end-result of such coercion remained very unstable, as most of the individuals reverted to their previous condition soon after they left the coercive environment. In 1961 they both published books expanding on these findings. Schein published Coercive Persuasion and Lifton published Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism. More recent writers including Mikhail Heller have suggested that Lifton's model of brainwashing may throw light on the use of mass propaganda in other communist states such as the former Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|As {{the rising}} number and {{popularity}} of food trucks push {{them into the}} food mainstream, region by region, problems with local legislators and police reacting to new situations, and brick-and-mortar restaurants fearing competition, have to be worked through, in some cases creating significant business uncertainty. Chicago long held {{the distinction of being}} the only city in the United States that did not allow food trucks to cook on board, which required trucks to prepare food in a commercial condition, then wrap and label the food and load it into a <b>food</b> <b>warmer.</b> In 2012, under pressure from food truck owners and supporters, including the University of Chicago Law School, regulations were changed to allow on-board cooking, however, controversially, food trucks are required to park 200 feet away from any restaurant, which virtually eliminates busy downtown locations.|$|E

25|$|Woks are wide, roughly bowl-shaped vessels {{with one}} or two handles at or near the rim. This shape allows a small pool of cooking oil in the centre of the wok to be heated to a high {{temperature}} using relatively little fuel, while the outer areas of the wok are used to keep <b>food</b> <b>warm</b> after it has been fried in the oil. In the Western world, woks are typically used only for stir-frying, but they can actually be used for anything from steaming to deep frying.|$|R
