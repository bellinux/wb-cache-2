40|$|The {{source of}} strong and broad {{emission}} of the Balmer-α line in mixed plasmas of hydrogen (or deuterium) and noble gases {{in front of}} metallic surfaces is a subject of controversial discussion of many plasma types. In this work the excitation source of the Balmer lines is investigated by means of optical emission spectroscopy in the plasma device PSI- 2. Neutral <b>fast</b> non-Maxwellian hydrogen <b>atoms</b> are produced by acceleration of hydrogen ions towards an electrode immersed into the plasma. By variation of the electrode potential the energy of ions and in turn of reflected <b>fast</b> <b>atoms</b> can be varied {{in the range of}} 40 − 300 eV. The <b>fast</b> <b>atoms</b> in front of the electrode are observed simultaneously by an Echelle spectrometer (0. 001  nm/channel) and by an imaging spectrometer (0. 01  nm/channel) up to few cm in the plasma. Intense excitation channels of the Balmer lines are observed when hydrogen is mixed with argon or with krypton.

Intermixing hydrogen with other noble gases (He, Ne or Xe) one observes the same effect however the emission is one order of magnitude less compared to Kr-H or Kr-D plasmas.

Two possible sources of excitation are discussed in details: one is the excitation of hydrogen atoms by argon atoms in the ground state and the second one is the process of the so-called excitation transfer between the metastable states of noble gases and hydrogen.

Some applications require a low ohmic resistance between the materials. Therefore, IV-characteristics of n-type wafer bonds between n-Si and n-GaAs were thoroughly investigated. n-Si/n-Si bonds showed ohmic resistance below 2. 5 × 10 − 3 cm 2. However diode like IV-curves were found for both n-GaAs/n-GaAs and n-Si/n-GaAs bonds.

Hall measurements of n-GaAs after <b>fast</b> <b>atom</b> beam treatment confirmed both, a reduction of the active carrier concentration, and the electron mobility. It was found that thermal annealing and higher bond temperatures can help reducing the potential barrier height at the n-Si/n-GaAs interface and thus lower the electrical bond resistance by healing crystalline defects. Highly conductive n-Si/n-GaAs wafer bonds with an interface resistance below 3. 6 × 10 − 3 cm 2 were achieved after the optimization. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|The {{source of}} the broad {{radiation}} of <b>fast</b> hydrogen <b>atoms</b> in plasmas containing noble gases {{remains one of the}} most discussed problems relating to plasma–solid interface. In this paper, we present a detailed study of Balmer lines emission generated by fast hydrogen and deuterium atoms in an energy range between 40 and 300 eV in a linear magnetised plasma. The experiments were performed in gas mixtures containing hydrogen or deuterium and one of the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr or Xe). In the low-pressure regime (0. 01 – 0. 1 Pa) of plasma operation emission is detected by using high spectral and spatial resolution spectrometers at different lines-of-sight for different target materials (C, Fe, Rh, Pd, Ag and W). We observed the spatial evolution for H α, H β and H γ lines with a resolution of 50 μm in front of the targets, proving that emission is induced by reflected atoms only. The strongest radiation of <b>fast</b> <b>atoms</b> was observed in the case of Ar–D or Ar–H discharges.

First, the present work shows that the maximum of emission is achieved for the kinetic energy of 70 – 120 eV/amu of <b>fast</b> <b>atoms.</b> Second, the emission profile depends on the target material as well as surface characteristics such as the particle reflection, e. g. angular and energy distribution, and the photon reflectivity.
