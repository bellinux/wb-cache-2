40|$|Makhteshim Agan España S. A. {{to modify}} the {{existing}} MRL for tebuconazole in mandarins. In order to accommodate for a new use of tebuconazole in Spain, it is proposed to raise the existing MRL in mandarins from 0. 05 mg/kg (the limit of quantification) to 3 mg/kg. Spain drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 20 July 2009. According to Article 6 of the Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom received an application from COLEACP/PIP to set an <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> for tebuconazole in passion fruit from Kenya {{at the level of}} 1 mg/kg.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, The Netherlands, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Exponent International Ltd (on behalf of ICA International Chemicals (PTY) Ltd) to set an <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> in citrus from South Africa for the active substance didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) at the level of 6 mg/kg. The Netherlands drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the data require the setting of an <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 6 mg/kg for citrus. However, additional information on the typical South African post-harvest treatment practice should be provided to decide whether the submitted trials are representative of the authorised GAP. A sufficiently validated analytical method to enforce the proposed MRL of DDAC on citrus is available. EFSA concludes that the consumer risk assessment did not identify a consumer health risk resulting from the post harvest uses of DDAC on citrus fruits. However {{it should be noted that}} the risk assessment is affected by a high degree of uncertainties which result from data gaps identified in the dossier. Finally, EFSA concludes that risk managers have to decide whether the setting of an <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 6 mg/kg is acceptable since the MRL currently into force for citrus in South Africa is 2 mg/kg only...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF Agro SAS to set an <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> for prohexadione-calcium in peanuts grown in the United States of America (USA). In order to accommodate for the authorised use in the USA, France proposed to raise the existing MRL of prohexadione in peanuts from the limit of quantification of 0. 1 mg/kg to 0. 9 mg/kg. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for the <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> request of prohexadione-calcium on peanuts. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of the active substance in peanuts. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed MRL for peanuts supporting the authorised use of prohexadione-calcium in the USA will not result in a long-term consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health ris...|$|E

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} {{was developed to}} determine optimal testing strategies, costs, and risks of a dual marketing system. The model chooses the testing strategy (application, intensity, and tolerance) that maximizes utility (minimizes disutility) of additional system costs due to testing and quality loss and allows simulation of the risk premium required to induce grain handlers to undertake a dual marketing system versus a Non-GM system. Cost elements including those related to testing, quality loss, and a risk premium were estimated for a model representing a grain export chain. Uncertainties were incorporated and include test accuracy, risk of adventitious commingling throughout, and variety declaration.

Tricyclazole is a non-included active substance and no EU uses are currently authorized. Thus, the existing EU MRL of 1 mg/kg in rice should be lowered to the LOQ. The applicant requested to maintain the existing EU MRL to allow the import of rice treated with tricyclazole from third countries. The EMS confirmed that the MRL should be set provisionally at the level 1 mg/kg to accommodate the Brazilian GAP. EFSA is of the opinion that {{on the basis of the}} currently available studies, the toxicological reference values for tricyclazole cannot be set, since the genotoxic potential of tricyclazole could not be totally disregarded. In addition, uncertainties regarding the carcinogenic potential of tricyclazole were identified by EFSA. The submitted residue trials data were found to be insufficient to derive an MRL proposal which accommodates the use of tricyclazole on rice in Brazil. EFSA concludes that the <b>import</b> <b>tolerance</b> request for tricyclazole in rice is not sufficiently supported by data which are needed to justify maintaining the existing EU MRL of 1 mg/kg in rice...|$|E

In order to accommodate for the authorized uses of spiromesifen on tea in Japan, India and Indonesia, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL in tea to 50 mg/kg. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA.

The raising of the EC MRLs for {{metconazole}} in banana is requested {{to meet the}} needs of international trade for products produced in Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and Ecuador. The higher MRLs for other crops are requested {{to meet the needs}} of the USA. The RMS Belgium drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 19 November 2009. EFSA derived the following conclusions based on the above mentioned evaluation report as well as the EFSA conclusion on the peer review of metconazole prepared under Directive 91 / 414 /EEC. The metabolism of metconazole is elucidated in three crop groups following the foliar application of metconazole. Even though studies indicate that the main residue in cereal grain and rape seeds is triazole alanine, the peer review decided not to include it in the residue definition. Instead, the risk assessment and enforcement residue definition was set as parent metconazole. Triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid, another compound identified in cereal metabolism, are metabolites common with other active substances belonging to the triazole chemical class. Since the triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs) occur in plant commodities treated with triazoles in significant concentrations,...|$|R

40|$|Australia exports a major {{proportion}} of its agricultural production and is {{highly dependent on}} maintaining and developing access to, and competitiveness in, export markets. To preserve Australia’s status as a provider of high quality grain, the majority of Australian primary producers rely on pesticides to protect their crops from pests and diseases, particularly in post-harvest situations. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) supports Australian agriculture by registering and allowing the supply of safe and effective animal health and crop protection products. A residue risk management continuum is established when the effectiveness of chemical registration and control of chemical use regulations is assessed through residue monitoring programs. Programs assess good agricultural practice and provide traceback capacity to investigate areas of concern. Risk communication provides opportunities for continuous improvement. In the early 1960 s, the Australian Government established a non-regulatory body, the national residue survey (NRS). In 2008 - 2009, random monitoring programs were conducted for over 50 commodities (21 grains, five horticultural commodities, 11 fish species, 12 animal species, honey and egg with over 20, 000 samples collected for analytical testing. The NRS grain residue monitoring program {{is presented as a}} case study of the residue risk management continuum demonstrating to overseas markets the high level of residue integrity of Australian grain. Over 4, 000 grain samples are collected and analysed per annum. Most of the samples are collected in the bulk export program where samples are collected from every hatch of every ship loaded at the seventeen Australian grain export terminals. The chemical screens have expanded beyond the multi-residue screen (MRS) insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to include phosphine, additional herbicides (not included in the MRS), heavy metals and mycotoxins. In its current form, the NRS grains program provides 15 years of residue testing data which demonstrates a very high degree of conformance with Australian MRLs and the <b>import</b> <b>tolerances</b> of overseas trading partners. In addition, trends in residue testing data demonstrate a decline in the frequency of residue detections and the levels of residue detected. To be confident that residue testing results meet the requisite standards, the reliability of the Australian analyses must be assured. The NRS laboratory performance evaluation system has been developed to provide that assurance, using a range of proficiency tests and other techniques in the selection of laboratories for NRS work. Residue testing results are reported against both Australian MRLs and the international MRLs which apply in the relevant export market. NRS maintains databases of overseas MRLs and compares its residue testing results of exported commodities against those standards. Grain marketers receive certificates of analysis, in the form of NRS residue testing results, for each shipment prior to arrival at the overseas market...|$|R
