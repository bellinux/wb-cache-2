Some aircraft conversion stations have addressed this problem by replacing the piston engine with a turboprop engine such as the PT6. The added power and lighter installed weight, together with greater availability of kerosene fuel instead of high-octane aviation gasoline, make this a desirable modification, but at a high financial cost.|$|E

By 1962, humpback, blue and fin whales were <b>getting</b> <b>harder</b> {{to find in}} the North Pacific, and the Soviet whalers, under great pressure from their own government to meet production targets, deliberately chose to hunt right whales, apparently killing every right whale they could over the next eight years, in the North Pacific and also the southern oceans. The Soviet government then filed fraudulent reports with the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics and the International Whaling Commission, admitting killing during this period only one right whale, by accident.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} amate paper commercialization {{has led to}} {{environmental}} issues in the San Pablito area and farther away. It is <b>getting</b> <b>harder</b> to find bark due to the over-stripping of trees {{and the loss of}} forests to agriculture and development. There have been attempts to cultivate the tree species currently used for paper-making, but without success. Currently, there are attempts to reforest the area with a similar species which grows to maturity faster. The use of caustic soda and industrial dyes in the process of making amate has caused problems with pollution, especially of the San Marcos River, whose waters then pollute the Cazones River.|$|E

[...] By 1998, IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo 64 cartridge titles to have software support for an impending expansion disk.

2500|$|Photography for {{the album}} was done by George DuBose, who had also done {{photography}} for the band's previous three releases: Subterranean Jungle, Too Tough to Die, and Animal Boy. The front cover's picture was taken in Chinatown, New York City, in an old stairwell where they had DuBose's cousin and his cousin's friend—who are credited as [...] "Husky Bros." [...] on the Halfway to Sanity liner notes— blocked off the crowd while the photo session was in place. By 4:30 pm, DuBose and other crew members had set up red lighting and a fog machine. After DuBose's camera went through three reels of photos, Johnny insisted that was enough, to which DuBose replied that the record company was paying {{him a lot of}} money for the shoot, so they should make it worth while. The photo session, however, only lasted about ten to fifteen minutes, and was done in a poorly lit area, which Johnny said was [...] "pretty good not to make us look old, and it was <b>getting</b> <b>harder</b> and harder." [...] The back cover photograph was also shot by DuBose, which features green tombstones in a Jewish cemetery. He also took the inner sleeve photos, which depict [...] "Peking ducks hanging in the window of a restaurant, with glaze dripping off their tails, and we used them for the inner sleeve," [...] according to DuBose.|$|E

60|$|The {{position}} was one {{which must have}} had its impressiveness for all minds that were not of the dullest order, {{even if they were}} inclined, as Macchiavelli was, to interpret the Frate's character by a key that presupposed no loftiness. To Romola, whose kindred ardour gave her a firm belief in Savonarola's genuine greatness of purpose, the crisis was as stirring {{as if it had been}} part of her personal lot. It blent itself as an exalting memory with all her daily labours; and those labours were calling not only for difficult perseverance, but for new courage. Famine had never yet taken its flight from Florence, and all distress, by its long continuance, was <b>getting</b> <b>harder</b> to bear; disease was spreading in the crowded city, and the Plague was expected. As Romola walked, often in weariness, among the sick, the hungry, and the murmuring, she felt it good to be inspired by something more than her pity--by the belief in a heroism struggling for sublime ends, towards which the daily action of her pity could only tend feebly, as the dews that freshen the weedy ground to-day tend to prepare an unseen harvest in the years to come.|$|E
