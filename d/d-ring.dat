5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a <b>D-ring</b> to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to oral activity, 17α-alkylation also confers a high potential for hepatotoxicity, and all 17α-alkylated AAS have been associated, albeit uncommonly {{and only after}} prolonged use (different estimates between 1 and 17%), with hepatotoxicity. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still {{increase the risk of}} hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). In accordance, <b>D-ring</b> glucuronides of testosterone and DHT {{have been found to be}} cholestatic.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>D-ring</b> {{interacts with}} the +1 {{cytosine}} on non-cleaved strand and stabilizes the topo I-DNA covalent complex by forming hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is between carbonyl group in position 17 on the <b>D-ring</b> and amino group on the pyrimidine ring of +1 cytosine. CPT is selectively cytotoxic to the cells replicating DNA during S phase [...] and its toxicity is primarily a result of conversion of single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks when the replication fork collides with the cleavage complexes formed by DNA and CPT.|$|E
50|$|<b>D-rings</b> {{are usually}} fitted to the waistbelt, {{shoulder}} straps and crotch strap to secure stage cylinders, additional equipment, and clipping off demand valves, light heads, and submersible pressure gauges {{which are not}} currently being used. The number and position of these <b>D-rings</b> can be adjusted by the user, {{but there are a}} few positions which have become fairly standard.|$|R

50|$|Rigid Hogarthian style {{backplate}} and wing BCD {{systems may}} be modified by adding butt-plates, bungee cords and optional special sidemount buoyancy compensators. Cylinders are supported at the valve end by bungee loops that {{run from the}} backplate to the front chest <b>D-rings.</b> The lower cylinder clip attaches to <b>D-rings</b> mounted on the waist belt or 'rails' on a butt plate.|$|R
2500|$|During the First World War, {{the design}} of the trench coat was {{modified}} to include shoulder straps and D-rings. The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; There is a popular myth that the <b>D-ring</b> was for the attachment of hand grenades. [...] The ring was originally for attaching map cases and swords or other equipment to the belt. This latter pattern was dubbed [...] "trench coat" [...] by the soldiers in the front line. Many trench coats had large pockets for maps and cleverly placed flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber coats. A range of waterproof coats were designed and sold during wartime that incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of leisurewear. What became known as the ‘trench coat’ combined the features of a military waterproof cape and the regulation greatcoat designed for British officers. Many veterans returning to civilian life kept the coats that became fashionable for both men and women.|$|E
50|$|A <b>D-ring</b> {{may be used}} {{at the end of}} {{a leather}} or fabric strap, or may be secured to a surface with a metal or fabric strap; though there are D-rings with a middle body {{designed}} to be welded to steel. Ideally, a <b>D-ring</b> swings freely after it has been secured. D-rings may vary in composition, geometry, weight, finish and load (rated) capacity.Though there are differences, a weld-on pivoting link is commonly called a <b>D-ring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Changing the <b>D-ring</b> cyclopentanone to a {{six-membered}} δ-lactone {{decreased the}} binding {{ability of the}} compounds. Compound [...] combined the <b>D-ring</b> structure of testolactone and the A-ring structure of formestane but had considerably lower inhibition of aromatase than formestane.|$|E
50|$|Leather sleepsacks are {{generally}} very confining {{but do not}} stretch. If they are sized correctly they are very comfortable for long-term usage, and many bondage enthusiasts spend entire nights comfortably confined in them. In {{order to make the}} tightest fit possible, many leather sleepsacks have small <b>D-rings</b> down each side of the main zipper along the front of the sack, which allows the sack to be pulled tighter around the body using rope laced between the <b>D-rings.</b> This system of <b>D-rings</b> and rope lacing also protects the zipper from any stress that the occupant of the sack might exert on it. To further add to the confining aspects of the sleepsack, there are usually straps or belts that go around the body at intervals {{along the length of the}} sack, starting at the collar and going down to the ankles. To keep the straps in place and prevent them from shifting, they pass through larger <b>D-rings</b> down the sides of the sleepsack.|$|R

50|$|To {{minimize}} obstruction {{when the}} <b>D-ring</b> {{is not in}} use, recessed tie-down rings are designed that accommodate the <b>D-ring</b> so it is flush to the surface. There are some non-recessed designs that have an adhesive base. The corresponding work load limits (WLL) must not be exceeded.|$|E

5000|$|Vest BCs {{typically}} provide up {{to about}} 25 kilograms of buoyancy (depending on size) and are fairly comfortable to wear, if of the correct size and adjusted to fit the diver. Vest BCs {{are the most common}} type among recreational divers because they can integrate buoyancy control, weights, attachment points for auxiliary gear, and cylinder retention in a single piece of gear. The diver need only attach a cylinder and regulator set {{in order to have a}} complete scuba set. Some [...] "tech-rec" [...] (technical and recreational) vest BC's have the ability to carry multiple cylinders - Twin sets on the back, and sling cylinders at the sides, suspended from <b>D-rings.</b> The lack of flexibility of positioning the <b>D-rings</b> due to structural constraints on some designs is partly compensated by fitting larger numbers of <b>D-rings,</b> some of which may be in the right place for a given diver.|$|R

5000|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} lanyard or strap {{carried by}} a surface {{supplied}} stand-by diver {{to be used to}} tether an unresponsive diver to the standby diver during a rescue. It is attached at one end to a <b>D-ring</b> on the stand-by diver's harness, and has a clip at the other end which may be secured to a <b>D-ring</b> on the casualty's harness to allow the rescuer the use of both hands during the return to the bell or surface.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the SPIE rope {{is lowered}} into the pickup area from a {{hovering}} helicopter. Patrol personnel, each wearing a harness with an attached carabiner, hook up to a <b>D-ring</b> inserted in the SPIE rope. A second safety line {{is attached to a}} second <b>D-ring</b> located above the first. The helicopter lifts vertically from an extract zone until the rope and personnel are clear of obstructions, then proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone. The rope and personnel are treated as an external load and airspeeds, altitudes, and oscillations must be monitored.|$|E
