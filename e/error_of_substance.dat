40|$|The assay on {{anhydrous}} {{basis is}} a mathematically derived value from an experimental results of assay and water content tests. The results of assay and water content tests are determined, separately, on as-is basis.

Statistically, the two variables involved in accepted formula are assay on as-is basis {{and water to}} obtain assay on anhydrous basis. The experimental errors associated with these two variables propagate in assay on anhydrous basis. The error propagates either in constructive or destructive mode. The constructive mode <b>of</b> <b>error</b> propagation is combination <b>of</b> positive <b>error</b> <b>of</b> assay on as-is basis and positive <b>error</b> <b>of</b> water or negative <b>error</b> <b>of</b> assay on as-is basis and negative <b>error</b> <b>of</b> water. The constructive mode <b>of</b> <b>error</b> propagation has more impact on assay on anhydrous basis values and its confidence interval. The destructive mode <b>of</b> <b>error</b> propagation is combination <b>of</b> a positive <b>error</b> <b>of</b> assay on as-is basis and a negative <b>error</b> <b>of</b> water or vice versa.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to study the use of Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) combined with the partial least square (PLS) method for determining the residues of penicillin and cloxacillin in raw milk. The spectra were measured in the reflectance mode with transflectance cell in the spectral range of 10, 000 – 4, 000 cm- 1 with 100 scans. Calibration models were developed. They were assessed statistically based on correlation coefficients (R) and standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> calibration (SEC). For penicillin, the following values were established: R = 0. 951 and SEC = 0. 004. For cloxacillin, they were R = 0. 871 and SEC = 0. 007. These calibration models were verified later with cross-validation. Better results were obtained in the calibration and validation models that were developed on milk samples coming from one farm. Using FT-NIR, the maximum residue limit (MRL) of cloxacillin in milk can be determined. However, standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> calibration and validation for penicillin G exceed the fixed MRL.
