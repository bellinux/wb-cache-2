5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting the way <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of}} the highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch {{various parts of}} his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|Between April 2001 and March 2002, India played 12 {{official}} tests including 2 each in Zimbabwe and South Africa(3rd test being declared unofficial), 3 in Sri Lanka and a 3-match and 2-match home {{series against}} England and Zimbabwe respectively. Dravid performed below par scoring 669 runs from 12 tests {{at an average}} of 39.35 including 6 fifties. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> good touch in Zimbabwe as he scored 137 runs from 134 balls in the first tour game. However, he could score just a solitary fifty in the test series as the series ended in a 1–1 draw. He aggregated 138 runs {{at an average of}} 69.00 from the series. During Sri Lanka tour, Dravid moved up the order in the absence of injured Tendulkar and Laxman. He batted at no. 4 in the first test and at his favourite no. 3 position in the remaining two tests. Batting at no. 3, Dravid scored crucial 75 runs in the 4th innings of the 2nd test as India defeated Sri Lanka by 7 wickets chasing a target of 264 runs. He ended up as the highest scorer for India in the series with 235 runs at an average of 47.00 including 2 fifties. India lost the series 1–2. On the South African tour, Dravid opened the innings in the first test but failed to make a mark as India lost the match. In the 2nd test, India was set a target of 395 runs with a full day plus 41 overs of play left in the match. India, having failed to survive for 100 overs in any of the previous 3 innings in the series, started on a poor note losing their first wicket in the first over with zero runs on the scoreboard. However, Dravid forged an important partnership of 171 runs with Dasgupta. More importantly, the partnership lasted for 83.2 overs taking India to the brink of safety. Poor weather too helped India salvage a draw as only 96.2 overs could be bowled in the innings. However, the match is best known for the Mike Denness incident. The match referee handed a one match ban to Sehwag and suspended ban to five other Indian players including Tendulkar and Ganguly for various offences including excessive appealing and ball tampering. The BCCI threatened to call off the tour if Mike Denness continued as the referee. While ICC sided with Denness, South African board sided with BCCI replacing Denness and forcing ICC to declare the 3rd test unofficial. Dravid captained the team in the unofficial test in the absence of injured Ganguly. India lost the match by an innings margin. Except for the match saving innings of 87 runs at Port Elizabeth, Dravid failed miserably in the series bringing his series aggregate to 130 runs from 3 tests(2 official and one unofficial) at an average of 21.66. Dravid performed poorly in the subsequent home series against England and Zimbabwe, scoring just two fifties in 5 tests.|$|E

500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, and the way <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I {{saw him in the}} costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his popularly oriented works, Suzuki wrote a translation of the Lankavatara Sutra and a commentary on its Sanskrit terminology. [...] Later in his life he was a visiting professor at Columbia University. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> on the efforts of Saburō Hasegawa, Judith Tyberg, Alan Watts and the others {{who worked in the}} California Academy of Asian Studies (now known as the California Institute of Integral Studies), in San Francisco in the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the leading}} bowler on the 1952 tour, taking 80 wickets in {{first-class}} matches at 21.92, and 15 in the four Tests at 24.73. Wisden said he [...] "had days when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the highest world class, but on other occasions he lacked bite". In the first innings of the First Test he bowled 63 overs and took 5 for 100. In the match against Oxford University he took 8 for 84 and 5 for 66.|$|E

2500|$|After Ant slotted in {{some more}} solo gigs, {{including}} the Soho Festival in London's Wardour Street on 11 July, {{he and the}} band next played the Guildford GuilFest festival on 15 July. His set won applause from online reviewer Virtual Festivals, who reported that the band [...] "rocked the Good Time Guide Stage at Guilfest, leaving festival-goers wondering why anyone was watching anybody else. Unlike {{some of the other}} performers across the day, interaction with the crowd was at its peak and the band were introduced in full, mid-set, sandwiched amongst favourites such as Antmusic, Stand and Deliver and Goody Two Shoes." [...] The next day, 16 July 2011 he played the Southwold Latitude festival., winning more critical praise as Clash's online reviewer commented [...] "Ant knows how to write pop songs, and he knows how to entertain ... Ant (and his saucy backing vocalists) flirts with the crowd, and need only say two words to us ("Good afternoon") the whole show, but with such a cheeky grin, he doesn't need to elaborate. The Adam Ant of today's Latitude shows no flakiness of recent times, and it's testament to his enduring popularity that fans are left wide-eyed, grinning and speechless by a performance that's every bit as theatrical as you'd hope." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Paul Lester likewise enthused [...] "Adam Ant was a revelation, albeit mystifyingly low on the bill. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> great shape and sounded even better, treating the sheltering hordes to one thrilling hit after another" ...|$|E
