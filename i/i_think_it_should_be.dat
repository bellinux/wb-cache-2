[...] "There {{is a lack of}} input regarding African-Americans in the American history curriculum of schools all over America" [...] Mr. Alexander says. [...] "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a part of regular American history".|$|E
2500|$|Sprague also {{predicted}} that the lake would [...] "be visited by thousands hereafter." [...] Finally, he recommended that the lake not be named after its discoverer, saying: [...] "I do not know who first saw this lake, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> named after the discoverer." [...] Sprague suggested it be called [...] "Lake Majestic." [...] Today, it is known as Crater Lake. [...] Since {{he was the first}} to identify the lake's volcanic origin, Sprague deserves some credit for the name.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{a supporter}} of Thatcherism, Hitchens has criticised the Conservative Party for its free-market economic policies, calling it a [...] "wild form of liberalism", rather than conservatism. He once clashed with Iain Duncan Smith on Question Time over the privatisation of railways. On this issue, Hitchens has written [...] "I have always believed that the electric power grid should be nationalised. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> renationalised {{as a prelude to}} an enormous programme of nuclear power station building, without which we face an appalling energy crisis within 20 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated [...] "We need {{to present}} a strong, {{consistent}} and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup." [...] He further confessed [...] "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> with Portugal." [...] Subsequently, {{in the aftermath of}} a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively. Spain has previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, while Portugal organised the Euro 2004.|$|E

5000|$|The Disney {{corporation}} initially had {{no public}} {{statement on the}} use of Mickey Mouse's image in the Farfour character; Disney CEO Robert Iger later said, [...] "We were appalled by the use of our character to disseminate that kind of message."

5000|$|In 2005, Kennard {{was among}} twenty-one legislators who toured areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. The lawmaker said: [...] "To me, {{it just looks}} like swampland.

500|$|In March 2008 Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, {{co-founder of}} the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, {{publicly}} opposed {{the construction of the}} mosque, stating that [...] "We have too many mosques. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be built. What we need first is more integration between the existing mosques and the wider community." [...] Siddiqui's opposition joins that of Craig, together with that of Irfan Al-Alawi, the director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism Europe, who expressed extreme concern about the spread of Tablighi Jamaat. Both Siddiqui and Al-Alawi have different and opposed Islamic viewpoints to that of the Tablighi.|$|R
60|$|It {{is often}} asked {{what should be}} the first thing that a man sees when he lands in a foreign country; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the vision of his own country. At least when I came into New York Harbour, a sort of grey and green cloud came between me and the towers with multitudinous windows, white in the winter sunlight; and I saw an old brown house {{standing}} back among the beech-trees at home, the house of only one among many friends and neighbours, but one somehow so sunken in the very heart of England as to be unconscious of her imperial or international position, and out of the sound of her perilous seas. But what made most clear the vision that revisited me was something else. Before we touched land the men of my own guild, the journalists and reporters, had already boarded the ship like pirates. And one of them spoke to me in an accent that I knew; and thanked me for all I had done for Ireland. And it was at that moment that I knew most vividly that what I wanted was to do something for England.|$|E
60|$|An incalculable {{amount of}} lower {{life has been}} {{certainly}} passed through before that human organisation was attained, of which we and our generation are for the time the holders and transmitters. This is no mean heritage, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered as a sacred trust, for, together with man, intelligence of a sufficiently high order to produce great results appears, {{so far as we}} can infer from the varied records of the prehistoric past, to have first dawned upon the tenantry of the earth. Man has already shown his large power in the modifications he has made {{on the surface of the}} globe, and in the distribution of plants and animals. He has cleared such vast regions of forest that his work that way in North America alone, during the past half century, would be visable to an observer as far off as the moon. He has dug and drained; he has exterminated plants and animals that were mischievous to him; he has domesticated those that serve his purpose, and transplanted them to great distances from their native places. Now that this new animal man, finds himself somehow in existence, endowed with a little power and intelligence, he ought, I submit, to awake to a fuller knowledge of his relatively great position, and begin to assume a deliberate part in furthering the great work of evolution. He may infer the course it is bound to pursue, from his observation of that which it has already followed, and he might devote his modicum of power, intelligence, and kindly feeling to render its future progress less slow and painful. Man has already furthered evolution very considerably, half unconsciously, and for his own personal advantages, but he has not yet risen to the conviction that it is his religious duty to do so deliberately and systematically.|$|E
6000|$|There was a Tuesday club at the [...] "Crosskeys" [...] in Crossmichael, {{where the}} young bloods of the {{countryside}} congregated and drank deep on {{a percentage of the}} expense, so that he was left gainer who should have drunk the most. Archie had no great mind to this diversion, but he took it like a duty laid upon him, went with a decent regularity, did his manfullest with the liquor, held up his head in the local jests, and got home again and was able to put up his horse, to the admiration of Kirstie and the lass that helped her. He dined at Driffel, supped at Windielaws. He went to the new year's ball at Huntsfield and was made welcome, and thereafter rode to hounds with my Lord Muirfell, upon whose name, as that of a legitimate Lord of Parliament, in a work so full of Lords of Session, my pen should pause reverently. Yet the same fate attended him here as in Edinburgh. The habit of solitude tends to perpetuate itself, and an austerity of which he was quite unconscious, and a pride which seemed arrogance, and perhaps was chiefly shyness, discouraged and offended his new companions. Hay did not return more than twice, Pringle never at all, and there came a time when Archie even desisted from the Tuesday Club, and became in all things--what he had had the name of almost from the first--the Recluse of Hermiston. High-nosed Miss Pringle of Drumanno and high-stepping Miss Marshall of the Mains were understood to have had a difference of opinion about him the day after the ball--he was none the wiser, he could not suppose himself to be remarked by these entrancing ladies. At the ball itself my Lord Muirfell's daughter, the Lady Flora, spoke to him twice, and the second time with a touch of appeal, so that her colour rose and her voice trembled a little in his ear, like a passing grace in music. He stepped back with a heart on fire, coldly and not ungracefully excused himself, and a little after watched her dancing with young Drumanno of the empty laugh, and was harrowed at the sight, and raged to himself that this was a world in which it was given to Drumanno to please, and to himself only to stand aside and envy. He seemed excluded, as of right, from the favour of such society--seemed to extinguish mirth wherever he came, and was quick to feel the wound, and desist, and retire into solitude. If he had but understood the figure he presented, and the impression he made on these bright eyes and tender hearts; if he had but guessed that the Recluse of Hermiston, young, graceful, well spoken, but always cold, stirred the maidens of the county with the charm of Byronism when Byronism was new, it may be questioned whether his destiny might not even yet have been modified. It may be questioned, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doubted. It was in his horoscope to be parsimonious of pain to himself, or of the chance of pain, even to the avoidance of any opportunity of pleasure; to have a Roman sense of duty, an instinctive aristocracy of manners and taste; to be the son of Adam Weir and Jean Rutherford.|$|E

"I have {{no doubt}} it was all right," [...] he said, [...] "and {{as it was to}} be sold, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{preferred}} <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be to your father rather than anybody else.

5000|$|... "As a film, I {{felt it was}} a bit disappointing, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{have been}} funnier. Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also the writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R
60|$|Excuse me, on that ground, if I {{say a word}} or two as to what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>I</b> mention <b>it</b> with a view to the future) {{might be}} better in the paper.

50|$|A {{philosophical}} {{question was}} acknowledged by Hirst, {{as to whether}} the replacement shark meant that the result could still be considered the same artwork. He observed:It's a big dilemma. Artists and conservators have different opinions about what's important: the original artwork or the original intention. I come from a conceptual art background, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the intention. It's the same piece. But the jury will be out {{for a long time to}} come.|$|E

6000|$|I do not insist by {{any farther}} {{argument}} on this, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> commend itself {{at once to}} your knowledge {{of what has been}} and to your feeling of what should be. You cannot think that the buckling on of the knight's armour by his lady's hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion. It is the type of an eternal truth-- that the soul's armour is never well set to the heart unless a woman's hand has braced it; and it is only when she braces it loosely that the honour of manhood fails.

60|$|As to {{the first}} one, {{in regard to the}} Fugitive Slave law, I have never {{hesitate}}d to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery.|$|R

5000|$|DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor Doug Pratt {{called it}} [...] "an enjoyable action romp".

5000|$|About Roots to Branches, Ian Anderson said: [...] "I see Roots To Branches as the 90s {{version of}} Stand Up, {{because it has}} a lot of the things that I feel {{represented}} the key elements of Jethro Tull: there's lots of flute, lots of riffy guitars and quite a broad palette of influences, from the blues and classical to the Eastern motifs that were apparent on Stand Up [...] ". On the other hand, Anderson also added that [...] "the only thing about it that lets me down is that I made it sound a little too Seventies. I deliberately made the album sound like it was in the context of a live performance, rather than have it sound too 'studio.' But looking back on <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have been a bit more varied".|$|R
