40|$|This work {{encompasses}} {{an inquiry}} {{into the role of}} the entrepreneur in economic development, and a report of interviews with eighty African businessmen in the Transkei, Ciskei and some urban locations. South Africa provides a particularly interesting field for the study of African enterprise insofar as it is possible to examine the evolution of entrepreneurship in two fundamentally different environments - namely rural reserves and large urban areas. Furthermore, there has been a substantial {{increase in the number of}} African entrepreneurs during this century. The study achieves added significance in view of the wide racial income differentials which are an endemic feature of South African socio-economic existence; moreover, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that, despite the high real growth rates during recent years, the racial income gap is widening. A corollary to this is the worsening of the relative - though not necessarily the absolute - economic position of the Black population. Hence : "the fundamental question for South Africa's economic future revolves around the income relationship between the Whites and the African segment of the non- White group. " At present a great deal of pressure is being exerted on White employers to adopt more racially <b>equitable</b> systems of <b>remuneration,</b> and on the Government to relax the industrial colour bar. Although such measures would probably have a positive influence in preventing the gap from widening still further, there is reason to believe that their effectiveness would be limited. The justifications for this assertion are twofold: a) As Allister Sparks has pointed out, "as long as (Blacks) are limited to being hirelings of (Whites), their progress will necessarily remain stunted. Because of race prejudice they will not be promoted as readily as Whites of equal ability. There will not be Black managers and company directors. They will be held down by a vicious circle of disadvantages: prejudice will deprive them of promotion, which will deprive them of experience, which will provide the pretext for not promoting them. b) There is much convincing evidence to show that property ownership rather than wages is the basic factor determining income distribution. Information indicative of the extreme racial inequality of property ownership in South Africa is given by Spandau, who has shown that in 1960 'other income' (i. e. rent, interest and profits) formed 119 % of work income of Whites, and only 19 % of the work income of Africans. 2 In the absence of cataclysmic social change, the development of African entrepreneurial talent emerges as a possible means of escaping from this apparent impasse. This does not of course imply that even a fairly large increase in the number of African entrepreneurs would automatically result in raising the living standards of a substantial portion of the Black population. Nevertheless, it would represent a positive move towards redressing the inequalities in property ownership and facilitate the acquisition of organizational skills, which in turn implies a better utilization of human resources than exists at present...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} of workers’ wages {{taken by the}} Catholic Church in the United States of America are interesting issues {{from the point of}} view of the ethics of economic life and the development of Catholic social thought. The interpretation of the main Catholic social ideas contained in Leo XIII’s encyclical letter Rerum novarum was made by Father John Augustine Ryan (1896 – 1945), who soon became a major proponent of the idea that a good economic policy can flow only with good ethics. In the history of the United States of America, the turn of 19 th and 20 th centuries was a time of the development of labor unions, associations, and workers’ organizations, consolidating efforts to achieve <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration</b> (a living wage) and regulate working conditions. It was also a time of struggling with the ideas of socialism and nationalism. The Catholic Church played a significant role in the discourse on these issues, including the influence of John A. Ryan.

40|$|Abstract- Primary {{education}} {{constitutes a}} very important stage of the entire structure of education. The entire edifice of our national development {{is based on the}} availability and quality of primary education. It was with this objective that the framers of our Constitution pledged to provide free and compulsory primary education to each and every child. After becoming independent, India, as a democratic welfare state, announced Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE) and equal opportunity for all as its basic principle. It attracted unprecedented attention during the last decade-and-a-half with the adaptation of the National Policy on Education in 1986 resulting in launching of the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) in early 1990 s. More recently in 2000, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has been launched to further the goal of education for all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years. Consequently, demand for additional teachers in all the schools has increased manifold. In order to meet the rising demand for teachers the state governments in India have resorted to the appointment of teachers on contract basis, on specified terms and conditions, often termed as ‘Para Teacher’, perhaps partly due to their poor fiscal situation. Findings have revealed the para teachers, also known as Siksha Mitras, have {{played a significant role in}} realizing the objectives of UEE. State Education Department need facilitate the improvement of professional competence of the Siksha Mitras – the para teachers besides ensuring <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration</b> to them along with improving the general infrastructure in schools...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} speculation recently regarding {{the effect of}} the growing prevalence of institutional investors in the equity markets on investee company behaviour. Institutional investors include superannuation funds, banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. It has been posited that the growth of institutional investors may lead to the pursuit of what is generally referred to in the human resource literature as ‘high commitment’ employment practices in investee companies. 1 This may be because institutional investors are using ‘voice’ mechanisms to pressure investee companies to adopt ‘high commitment’ human resource practices. For the purposes of our study it is sufficient to note that these labour management practices typically involve managerial attempts to motivate and manage workers through a series of workplace practices that incorporate the interests of employees rather than through strict command and control structures. 2 These might include investment in staff training and development, employment security, flexible workplace practices and self-directed work teams, investment in occupational health and safety, <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration,</b> incentive pay, and ‘partnerships’ and consultation with employees and/or their representatives. In formal labour relations terms, it might also include respect for freedom of association, the right to bargain collectively and other core labour standards. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover whether it is the intention of institutional investors to encourage investee companies to adopt ‘high commitment’ employment practices through case studies of twelve prominent institutional investors with funds invested in the Australian equities market and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (an industry body representing 39 superannuation funds) ...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{increasing}} efforts {{within the}} European Union to harmonise {{intellectual property law}} also lead to the approximation of some aspects of unfair competition law. Despite these efforts, common standards for unfair competition law are still not present. To find a common legal norm defining the scope of protection of trade marks and related intangibles in unfair competition law, {{similarities and differences between}} various national unfair competition provisions are explored {{in the light of the}} Paris Convention. Setting aside the clear examples of tortious behaviour in competition, the difficulty surrounding the definition of clear norms in other unfair competition cases is recognised. Protection of intangible subject matter on an other basis than tort can lead to idiosyncratic and circular reasoning. It is shown that property theories and policy decisions have to be dismissed as the sole basis in the determination whether protection is due. The author describes how a legal concept bearing close resemblance to tort can overcome these problems. He describes and argues for an action for 'malign competition', based on the concept of unjust enrichment. In examining selected legal systems in more detail, several key aspects of the proposed action appear to be in operation already, albeit not recognised. Selected cases from several jurisdictions are subsequently tested according to the model of the proposed action for malign competition. It is demonstrated that the legal reasoning is more satisfactory, offering a clear norm and takingway the old idiosyncrasies. Where the outcome on the basis of the same facts is different, it is shown that this is the result of a more satisfactory implementation of the notions of preemption and <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration</b> than is currently employed. The fact that the principle of unjust enrichment is universally recognised will in the opinion of the author advance the prospects for future harmonisat...|$|E

40|$|The key {{aspect to}} {{stimulating}} economic and individual {{growth in the}} workplace {{has been shown in}} numerous case studies to be the removal of discrimination. Affirmative Action looks at dealing with, and making amends for past injustices, as well as moving towards equal employment opportunities in a constructive manner. It is about recognizing that people are inherently different whilst trying to achieve a “colour – blind” society. The Employment Equity Act No. 55 of 1998 was put in place by Government to facilitate the implementation of fair workplace practices, which will correct the imbalances of the past as well as creating a workforce, which reflects the demographics of South Africa. The inequalities in employment patterns and practices with respect to access to employment, training, promotion and <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration</b> especially for black people, women and people with disabilities are addressed in the said Act. The Employment Equity Act is quite specific about the minimum requirements of an organisation’s Employment Equity Plan, which make it easy to identify what progress is being made towards ending discrimination in the workplace. The minimum penalty for contravening the Employment Equity Act is R 500 000 and the maximum is R 900 000. The question arises as to whether South African organisations are merely implementing Employment Equity policies to adhere to the basic requirements and deadlines of the Act. Or, are these policies genuinely based on commitment to the principles of equality and equal opportunity for all in the workplace. Calsonic Kansei South Africa has put into place various training and succession plans, which will help to achieve the organizational goal of being more equitable in terms of the Employment Equity Act. Employment agency databases have also been analysed to determine the availability of suitably qualified Affirmative Action employees.

40|$|In my opinion, the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should {{investigate}} {{whether it is}} feasible and viable to implement a legislative scheme for the collective administration of plant breeders’ rights. A collecting society for plant breeders’ rights would involve an organisation that administers the rights of individual plant breeders. It could grant permission to use propagating material and set conditions for their use. Such collective management would be a tool that rights-holders could employ when the individual exercise of the rights is impractical or inefficient. Such a regime could address a number of concerns raised by the inquiry into plant breeders’ enforcement. The exclusive role of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Office {{is to determine the}} validity of applications for plant breeders’ rights. It would be inappropriate for this independent arbiter {{to be involved in the}} management and enforcement of plant breeders’ rights. An independent collecting society for plant breeders’ rights would fulfil this separate role. The seed industry has expressed concerns that many of its members – especially individual plant breeders and small-to-medium businesses - lack the capacity or expertise to enforce plant breeders’ rights. A collecting society for plant breeders’ rights would be able to bring infringement actions on behalf of its members. The seed industry has also raised concerns about the ability of their members to manage and exploit plant breeders’ rights. A collecting society would help facilitate transactions between the owners of plant breeders’ rights, and the users of plant breeders’ rights. Furthermore, there is a need to provide formal, legislative backing for the industry practice of end-point royalties. There is a need to amend the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1994 (Cth) to provide for statutory licensing in respect of end-point royalties. A collecting society for plant breeders’ rights would be an appropriate independent body to administer statutory licenses in respect of end-point royalties. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should also take into account some of the issues and challenges, which have arisen in respect of the collective administration of intellectual property rights. The Federal Government – and the agricultural industry – would have to make a significant outlay to start-up such a collecting society. There would be a need to determine the nature of such a collective administration – in particular, whether it would be a voluntary system; a compulsory system; or a mix of the two. A collecting society in respect of plant breeders’ rights would enjoy a dominant position in the marketplace. There would be a need to obtain authorisation from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in respect of the operation of the scheme. Furthermore, there would be a need for proper regulatory oversight of a collecting society in respect of plant breeders’ rights. Voluntary codes of conduct have proven to be an ineffective means of governing collecting societies in the context of copyright law. There would need to be an administrative body empowered to establish, either mandatorily or at the request of an interested party, the royalties to be paid for the use of plant breeders’ rights, when the administration of such copyright is entrusted to a collective-administration society. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should seek to preserve the special identity of the plant breeders’ rights regime. It would be inappropriate to discard unique doctrinal features – such as the criteria for distinctiveness, uniformity, and stability; the cascading rights of plant breeders; the doctrine of essential derivation; and the special exceptions for farm-saved seed. The plant breeders’ rights regime should be a viable alternative to the patent regime. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should clarify the ‘cascading rights’ of plant breeders. The Cultivaust litigation illustrated that there needs to be further elucidation as to the circumstances in which plant breeders’ rights cascade from propagating material to harvested material and products arising from the harvested material. In particular, it is worth defining what a reasonable opportunity to exploit propagating material involves. As a matter of clarification, the Cultivaust litigation involved questions of the exhaustion of plant breeders’ rights – rather than matters of the farmers’ privilege. The Full Federal Court was critical that the trial judge confused the two issues. Unfortunately, the issues paper compounds the error of the trial judge – by conflating questions of ‘cascading rights’ and farm saved seed (in 4. 1 of the issues paper). It would be preferable if the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property decouple the issues of a reasonable opportunity to exploit propagating material from matters of farm-saved seed. One should not confuse rights with exceptions. The integrity of the farm saved seed provisions under the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1990 (Cth) should be respected and preserved. Such exceptions serve an important practical and symbolic function. The defence provides recognition of an old-tradition of saving seeds in farming. The farm-saved seed exception also provides legitimacy to the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1990 (Cth), especially amongst rural and regional sectors. There would be a political outcry amongst agricultural communities if the farm-saved seed provisions were curtailed, replaced, or annulled. It is recommended that the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1990 (Cth) be amended to provide that an agreement, or a provision of an agreement that excludes or modifies the farmers’ privilege have no effect. It is recommended that the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1990 (Cth) be amended to ban genetic restriction use technologies, which have the effect of excluding or modifying the farmers’ privilege. It is recommended that a farmers' privilege should be included in the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). It should specify that farmers are permitted to save and sow seeds from patented plants, as long as these progeny are not sold as commercial propagating material. The other key exceptions in the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act 1990 (Cth) – such as the defence of experimental use, the <b>equitable</b> <b>remuneration</b> provisions, and the safeguards for reasonable access to plant varieties – should also be retained...|$|E
