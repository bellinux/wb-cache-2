5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> are eliminated.

25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular dipoles, causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> (see dissipation factor). The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a hysteresis response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the ideal {{capacitor}} equation {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an ideal capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E

Such a dielectric response of ferroelectric/dielectric thin films has been theoretically addressed in this work. We propose that at the initial stage of the crystallization process in thin films, the transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase should increase substantially the dielectric loss; then, with further increase in the processing temperature, the coalescent growth of small crystalline grains into big ones could be helpful in reducing the <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> by lowering grain boundary densities.
