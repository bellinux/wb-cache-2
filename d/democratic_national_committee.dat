Instead, he took the recommendation of <b>Democratic</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E

McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson {{was not going to}} be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>National</b> <b>Committee</b> and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party.
