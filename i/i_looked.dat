5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at him and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
50|$|The <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> Like an Engineer {{movement}} has sparked other similar movements that also seek to break stereotypes in their industry, such as <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> Like a Surgeon, <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> like a Professor and <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> Like a Civil Engineer.|$|R

5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century {{relatively}} {{large numbers of}} Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War, with 20–30,000 in Swedish service, a Scots brigade in the Netherlands, and 5–6,000 raised for Danish service in the period 1626–27, 11,000 for France and large numbers in the armies of eastern Europe, including German states, Poland and Russia. As armed confrontation between Scotland and the Charles <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> increasingly likely from 1637, the Standing Committee of the Tables began {{to function as a}} war council. It appointed two lairds in every parish to draw up lists of men suitable for military service, arms and the names of Scots serving abroad so that they could be recalled. Three commissioners were appointed in each shire, two residing in Edinburgh and another remaining in the locality, where presbyteries appointed commissioners to communicate instructions to the parishes. Hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie. These veterans {{played an important role in}} training the parish recruits. Nobles were able to raise regiments, which usually bore their name as colonel, and they could appoint company commanders, but the lieutenant colonel and sergeant major of the regiment, and the lieutenant and sergeant of each company, were to be professional soldiers. The returning soldiers also brought expertise in fortification and trace italliene fortifications were added at Leith, Burntisland and Greenock. They would play a major role in the siege of Edinburgh in 1650.|$|E
25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, {{with a great}} {{burst of}} speed, a Michigan man went for him, grabbed him and downed him. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{for the number of}} the Michigan man. Lo and behold, it was 'Butch' Slaughter, a guard, who, under {{ordinary}} circumstances, would have no more business {{in that part of the}} field than I would. Down Harris and Slaughter went on our 20-yard line, and with them went the chance of all chances for Wisconsin, for the whistle which ended the game blew at that moment.|$|E
25|$|The loss is {{irreparable}} {{in every}} point of view: {{with him is}} gone all true philosophy, all publick virtue; {{there is nothing left}} but factious schemes and time-serving manoeuvres, contending one with the other, which shall do most mischief—not one English sentiment, not one statesmanlike idea—this is the publick loss. the private one is of everything that was warm, zealous, partial, where once he had placed his affections; for my own part, I feel it is the loss, not of a friend, but of a father; of one to whom <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up for advice and instruction; and who gave them with the interest and fidelity of a parent.|$|E
25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know it's foolish; {{but that}} is what 'looking ahead' always meant to me," [...] she said, with a sigh. [...] "But, since the doctor has been gone, I've talked to Mrs. Sol, and find it's for the best. And <b>I</b> <b>look</b> ahead, and see more clearly. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> ahead, and see my disgrace removed far away from HIM and you. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> ahead, and see you and HE living {{together}} happily, as you did before I came between you. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> ahead, and see my past life forgotten, my faults forgiven; and I think I see you both loving my baby, and perhaps loving me a little for its sake.

25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E

"They {{would not}} let me open it without searching my pockets, and depriving me of pen, ink, and paper; {{and at the same}} time two prelati kept me in {{constant}} conversation in Latin, and if <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at a passage too long, they would snatch the book out of my hand".|$|E
