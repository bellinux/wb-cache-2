50|$|Dietitian input is {{generally}} requested {{to ensure the}} person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and {{how to have a}} balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, <b>gluten-free</b> <b>products</b> are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans. <b>Gluten-free</b> <b>products</b> are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch.|$|E

50|$|Mercadona offers over 850 {{products}} for the wheat-intolerant. Mercadona has received over 750 comments, suggestions and requests from wheat-intolerant customers and coeliac associations in 2013, and has acted on these by passing them onto distribution companies and food manufacturers, {{as well as the}} store's own factories. Mercadona aims to create products that taste {{as close as possible to}} their mainstream counterparts. All of this while keeping the costs as low as possible. Products for the wheat-intolerant at Mercadona include yogurt, instant potato for making 'tortilla', or Spanish omelet, beans, sauces, hot chocolate powder, snack mixes, sliced bread, and even iced lollies and drinkable sorbets. It is said that the gluten-free movement started in Mercadona when a member of the founding family was diagnosed with coeliac disease. <b>Gluten-free</b> <b>products</b> were hard to come by in Spain, which prompted Mercadona to create a whole line of <b>gluten-free</b> <b>products</b> at very affordable prices.|$|E

50|$|Gluten {{proteins}} {{have low}} nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential {{in the human}} diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of <b>gluten-free</b> replacement <b>products</b> may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>gluten-free</b> bread-like <b>products</b> {{involves}} {{the study of}} gluten-free dough rheology and the resulting baked product characteristics, but little information has been obtained connecting dough and baked product properties. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine quality predictors of <b>gluten-free</b> bread-like <b>products</b> at dough level by defining possible correlations between dough rheological properties and both instrumental parameters and sensory characteristics of those <b>products.</b> Diverse rice-based <b>gluten-free</b> doughs were defined and rheologically characterised at dough level, and the technological and sensorial quality of the resulting baked products was investigated. Dough Mixolab® parameters, bread-like quality parameters (moisture content, specific volume, water activity, colour and crumb texture) and chemical composition significantly (P 0. 70) were found when quality instrumental parameters of the baked products were correlated with the dough Mixolab® parameters, and lower correlation coefficients (r < 0. 70) were found when sensory characteristics were correlated with dough rheology or instrumental parameters. Dough consistency during mixing (C 1), amplitude and dough consistency after cooling (C 5) would be useful predictors of crumb hardness; and C 5 would be also a predictor of perceived hardness of <b>gluten-free</b> bread-like <b>products.</b> © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Different {{studies have}} {{developed}} a variety of breads using cassava flour, with similar characteristics to wheat flour breads. The use of cassava flour in bread making is a convenient alternative for promoting {{the use of a}} local crop as well as reducing imports of wheat flour, promoting the production of high quality cassava flour, offering a <b>gluten-free</b> <b>product</b> and developing biofortified and fortified foods. Although the substitution level of cassava flour is limited, in some products, the incorporation of additives or flours from other crops improve the nutritional value and breadmaking quality of the baked foods. Several limitations have hindered the success of initiatives to promote, in some cassava producing countries, the intensive use cassava flour in bread making. Among these include the costs and efficiency of processing technologies, standards of the quality of cassava flour and lack of favorable policies. Further studies about bioavailability and retention of nutrients on baked foods and evaluation on the effects of processing cassava flour in relation to increasing the resistance starch are required to provide scientific evident for the health benefits of this flour...|$|R

50|$|Amaranth {{does not}} contain gluten, {{so it may be}} a healthy and less {{expensive}} alternative to ingredients traditionally used in <b>gluten-free</b> <b>products.</b> It has high biological value and its benefits are not limited to people with gluten-related disorders, but are applicable to the general population. Quantity and quality of proteins of amaranth are superior to those of wheat.

Some <b>gluten-free</b> commercial replacement <b>products</b> are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid / carbohydrate content.

Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have higher biological and nutritional value. Advances towards higher nutrition-content <b>gluten-free</b> bakery <b>products,</b> improved for example in terms of fiber content and glycemic index, have been made by using not exclusively corn starch or other starches to substitute for flour. In this aim, for example the dietary fiber inulin (which acts as a prebiotic) or quinoa or amaranth wholemeal have been as substitute for part of the flour. Such substitution has been found to also yield improved crust and texture of bread. It is recommended that anyone embarking on a gluten-free diet check with a registered dietitian {{to make sure they are}} getting the required amount of key nutrients like iron, calcium, fiber, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate. Vitamins often contain gluten as a binding agent. Experts have advised that it is important to always read the content label of any product that is intended to be swallowed.|$|R
