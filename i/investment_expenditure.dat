40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} financial constraints for firm <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{by looking at the}} relationship between <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> and proceeds from voluntary asset sales in financially healthy US manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether asset sales have a greater influence on <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> for firms that are likely to be financially constrained. Asset sales may provide a cleaner indicator of liquidity than cash flow since it appears not to be positively correlated with future investment opportunities. The cross-sectional differences in firm <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> are examined using an endogenous switching regression model with unknown sample separation, which does not require an a priori classification of firms or knowledge of their financial constraints. We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash generated from operations, cash obtained from asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate investment. Moreover, the sensitivity of investment to proceeds from asset sales is significantly stronger for firms that are likely to be associated with characteristics associated with financial constraints. ...|$|R

Considering {{the impact of}} legal institutions that protect investors, we conjecture that well-functioning institutional investor protection would help smooth {{the negative impact of}} political uncertainty on corporate investments. In doing so, we collected a sample in 40 countries from 1981 to 2009. We find that firms reduce <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> in election years, but increase <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the following years controlling for firm characteristics and economic conditions. This finding suggests that political uncertainty generates cycles in <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures</b> in election years, which is consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we find that there is a positive relationship between legal investor protection and <b>investment</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In addition, the interaction of legal investor protection and the election dummy is significantly positively related to firms’ investments, suggesting that legal investor protection helps smooth the negative effect of political uncertainty on corporate investments during election years. Our results are robust to alternative measures.
