500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office.

It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|Early in Bure's career, he {{was noted}} for playing a strong two-way game. Having joined Pat Quinn's defensive-minded Canucks in 1991, Bure's {{transition}} to the NHL was cited as being easier than that of his countryman, Igor Larionov, due to his quick adjustment to the team's defensive demands. Regarding Bure's first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets, reporter Mike Beamish explained that [...] "hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts, but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet-powered defensive diligence. On one play, after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone, the Russian winger raced back and almost single-handedly foiled a two-on-one Jets' rush, making up a half-rink disadvantage." [...] Bure was used on the team's penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks, and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances, pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone. During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, commentator and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale commented, [...] "I like the effort he gives it when he doesn't have the puck. We all know {{what he can do}} when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> score, but he's killing penalties, he's checking, doing a lot of things." [...] Bure tied for second-place on Bob McKenzie's 1993 coaches poll for the NHL's best penalty killer. He was also voted the league's second-best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as one of the smartest players in the NHL.|$|E

2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|E
