40|$|Audio {{recording}} is {{a convenient}} and important method for large-scale terrestrial environmental monitoring. However, {{it is impossible}} to listen and make sense of all the data collected. Attempts to generalise automated analysis tasks have not been successful due to the unconstrained nature of long-term <b>environmental</b> <b>recording.</b> Our approach to this big-data challenge is to facilitate visualisation of long-term audio recording, to keep ecologists in the loop. The content of longduration audio recordings are visualised by calculating acoustic indices. Our interface facilitates the customised visualisation and navigation of long-term audio recording by ecologists. Two case studies, one in Australia and one in Bhutan, are presented as examples...|$|E
30|$|The tests had two goals. The {{first goal}} was to study {{the quality of the}} textures: can people notice a {{degradation}} in audio quality when they are played an automatically created texture of an <b>environmental</b> <b>recording?</b> The second {{goal was to}} study the representativeness of the automatically created textures: can an automatically created texture credibly represent a location, such as a street, even if it had some noticeable audio quality problems? These experiments studied the audio textures from two perspectives: on one hand, the audio textures were compared directly to reference samples in a forced choice test, and on the other hand, the audio textures were presented without a reference asking subjects to rate the representativeness for a certain location. The later setup is more close to the target application of virtual location-exploration services, where audio textures are used to represent certain locations without direct reference to real recordings.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a strange}} and bitter irony that the US naval {{bombardment}} which launched the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 was called the ‘typhoon of steel’, invoking the turbulent winds that annually buffet this small island. Okinawans in coastal villages, such as Sunabe where the US forces made their landings, sought shelter from this mechanical, yet elemental force of destruction {{in one of the}} many caves that scatter the landscape. War planes still fly over Sunabe today, from the United States Air Force base of Kadena. Distinguishing and measuring these sounds and their effects on the health and livelihood of Sunabe residents has been the work of a Japanese acoustic scientist, Kozo Hiramatsu. Over the past twenty five years he has listened to and made sense of these sounds through the stories of individuals like Yogi-san who as a child took refuge in the cave and after the battle returned to take up residence in a house adjacent to the boundary fence of Kadena. It is in resonant spaces like the cave (gama) where he conducted the interview {{that is the subject of}} this composed <b>environmental</b> <b>recording,</b> that we may hear how war memory becomes a way of listening to the environment and how Yogi-san’s words, solidified as text and witness to history and expressed through the mixing of the sounds of natural elements and military machinery convey the experience of many Okinawan lives like his, suspended between the American wars of the past, present and future.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} and affordability {{of personal and}} <b>environmental</b> <b>recording</b> apparatuses are leading to increased documentation of our daily lives. This trend is bound to continue and it follows that academic, industry, and government groups are showing an increased interest in such endeavors for various purposes. In the present case, I assert that such documentation {{can be used to}} help remedy common memory problems. Assuming a long-term personal archive exists, when confronted with a memory problem, one faces a new challenge, that of finding relevant memory triggers. This dissertation examines the use of information-retrieval technologies on long-term archives of personal experiences towards remedying certain types of long-term forgetting. The approach focuses on capturing audio for the content. Research on Spoken Document Retrieval examines the pitfalls of information-retrieval techniques on error-prone speech- recognizer-generated transcripts and these challenges carry over to the present task. However, "memory retrieval" can benefit from the person's familiarity of the recorded data and the context in which it was recorded to help guide their effort. To study this, I constructed memory-retrieval tools designed to leverage a person's familiarity of their past to optimize their search task. To evaluate the utility of these towards solving long-term memory problems, I (1) recorded public events and evaluated witnesses' memory-retrieval approaches using these tools; and (2) conducted a longer- term memory-retrieval study based on recordings of several years of my personal and research-related conversations. Subjects succeeded with memory-retrieval tasks in both studies, typically finding answers within minutes. (cont.) This is far less time than the alternate of re-listening to hours of recordings. Subjects' memories of the past events, in particular their ability to narrow the window of time in which past events occurred, improved their ability to find answers. In addition to results from the memory-retrieval studies, I present a technique called "speed listening. " By using a transcript (even one with many errors), it allows people to reduce listening time while maintaining comprehension. Finally, I report on my experiences recording events in my life over 2. 5 years. by Sunil Vemuri. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|A {{network of}} local {{biological}} records centres or local <b>environmental</b> <b>records</b> centres (usually abbreviated to BRC, LRC or LERC,) covers most {{areas of the}} UK. All local centres are entirely independent of the Biological Records Centre. The first such local centre was the Natural History Record Bureau at what is now Tullie House Museum in Carlisle which opened in 1902. As with many LERCs it {{grew out of the}} biological recording work of the local natural history society. LERCs have a complementary role to BRC and recording schemes as systems [...] "for collating biological data {{from a wide range of}} sources (including organisations and individuals), for ensuring that data are properly validated and catalogued, and for providing access to them, thereby acting as a focus for biological information." [...] Local <b>Environmental</b> <b>Records</b> Centres are non-profit, partnership-led organisations and typically organised on a county or multi-county basis. Increasingly they are becoming better networked through the activities of the Association of Local <b>Environmental</b> <b>Records</b> Centres, the National Biodiversity Network, Natural England, The Wildlife Trusts partnership and NFBR, which became the National Forum for Biological Recording in 2013. rECOrd is an example of a Local <b>Environmental</b> <b>Records</b> Centre.|$|R
