25|$|Amateur boxing {{is governed}} by {{separate}} bodies in each home nation. At Olympic, World and European events, home nation boxers (with the exception of N.Ireland) compete under the GB podium squad banner. British amateurs have enjoyed success in international competition in recent years but unlike their counterparts boxing for the Irish Republic there's a tendency for them to turn professional early in their amateur career. The amateur sport is steadily recovering from a decline that reached a peak in the late 1980s, with dramatic increases in boxer numbers driven by recent GB podium squad success, most notably at the London 2012 Olympics. Although Britain's top amateur boxers are household names and lauded by the general public, the financial and commercial leverage that professional sports now have on televised media means amateur boxing rarely receives <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of T.V. coverage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fairness in wireless ad-hoc networks. Usually, the problem of fairness in wireless ad-hoc networks is addressed in a classic approach inherited from wired networks. The common assumption is that nodes/flows have pre-assigned <b>fair</b> <b>shares.</b> The task becomes then to modify wired networks' fair queueing algorithms to address wireless networks nature. Wired networks have efficient means of allocating <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> through admission control and additonally, the <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> remain constant throughout the session duration due to the static nature of the nodes. In ad-hoc networks, it is meaningless to assume statically pre-assigned <b>fair</b> <b>shares,</b> since on one hand, not only the nodes move, but also the routers are mobile, {{and on the other}} hand, contention is location dependent, such that in terms of absolute guarantees, fairness would at most mean "avoiding starvation": thus applying rate proportional fair queueing algorithms is beyond the original goal of such algorithm, viz. flow isolation/protection and bandwidth guarantee. In this work we argue in favor of multi-level scheduling for wireless ad-hoc networks with max-min fair allocation of the <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> at the lower-most layer (MAC layer). This paper, mainly lays down the theoretical framework by which one can calculate the <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> that would achieve max-min fairness in an ad-hoc network. We design distributed algorithms that allow each node to determine <b>its</b> max-min per-link <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> in a global ad-hoc network without knowledge of the global topology of the network. The results are then used in conjunction with a novel practical scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802. 11 to show how fairness is achieved...|$|R

40|$|In a {{distributed}} system with attacks and defenses, an economic investment in defense mechanisms aims at increasing {{the degree of}} system protection against the attacks. We study such investments in the popular selfish setting, where both attackers and defenders are self-interested entities. In particular, we assume a reward-sharing scheme among interdependent defenders; each defender wishes to (locally) maximize <b>its</b> own <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of the attackers caught due to him (and possibly due to the involvement of others).

This study examined the effect of industrial revolution on ecclesiastical architecture in Nigeria with a view to identifying the new technologies and materials that were employed.

Since the study was historical in nature, qualitative methods in form of literature, non-participant method in case study and unstructured interview were employed in gathering the data and content analysis with descriptions were used in analysis. The findings showed that the need for unobstructed viewing spaces, quest for its own time, globalization and new theology with liturgy warranted the desire to embrace industrial revolution.

40|$|Abstract — The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) aims at {{fair and}} {{efficient}} medium access in IEEE 802. 11. In face of its success, {{it is remarkable}} that there is little consensus on the actual degree of fairness achieved, particularly bearing its impact on quality of service in mind. In this paper we provide an accurate model for the fairness of the DCF. Given M greedy stations we assume fairness if a tagged station contributes a share of 1 /M to the overall number of packets transmitted. We derive the probability distribution of fairness deviations and support our analytical results by an extensive set of measurements. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement of long-term over short-term fairness. Regarding the random countdown values we quantify the significance of their distribution whereas we discover that fairness is largely insensitive to the distribution parameters. Based on our findings we view the DCF as emulating an ideal fair queuing system to quantify the deviations from a fair rate allocation. We deduce a stochastic service curve model for the DCF to predict packet delays in IEEE 802. 11. We show how a station can estimate <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> bandwidth <b>share</b> from passive measurements of its traffic arrivals and departures. I...|$|R
40|$|For a given TCP flow, {{exogenous}} {{losses are}} those occurring on links {{other than the}} flow's bottleneck link. Exogenous losses are typically viewed as introducing undesirable "noise" into TCP's feedback control loop, leading to inefficient network utilization and potentially severe global unfairness. This has prompted much research on mechanisms for hiding such losses from end-points. In this paper, we show through analysis and simulations that low levels of exogenous losses are surprisingly beneficial in that they improve stability and convergence, without sacrificing efficiency. Based on this, we argue that exogenous loss awareness {{should be taken into}} account in any AQM design that aims to achieve global fairness. To that end, we propose an eXogenous-loss aware Queue Management (XQM) that actively accounts for and leverages exogenous losses. We use an equation based approach to derive the quiescent loss rate for a connection based on the connection's profile and <b>its</b> global <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> In contrast to other queue management techniques, XQM ensures that a connection sees its quiescent loss rate, not only by complementing already existing exogenous losses, but also by actively hiding exogenous losses, if necessary, to achieve global fairness. We establish the advantages of exogenous-loss awareness using extensive simulations in which, we contrast the performance of XQM to that of a host of traditional exogenous-loss unaware AQM techniques...|$|R
