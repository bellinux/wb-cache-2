40|$|SUMMARY The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} into surface grinding Stayblade {{shows that this}} material presents severe conditions to the grinding wheel, and the grinding wheel face is broken down fiarly quickly. The method described in C of A Note 38 for wheel and coolant selection and development enabled the total wheel face life to be improved from 0. 105 cubic ins. to approximately 10. 00 cubic ins, per redress with acceptable surface finish. The use of soluble typos of coolants {{would appear to be}} much less efficient than cutting or <b>grinding</b> <b>oil</b> coolants and the following combinations were found best:- Wheel:- Carborundum 7. D. A. 60 I 5 IN BILT. Coolant:- Manchester Oil Refinery DOLPHIN MC OIL. Wheel life is 3. 5 cubic ins. per redress for 7 ins. dia. by 1 in. wide wheel. The addition of 5 % Wynns friction proofing fluid showed 200 % increase in wheel face life with acceptable surface finish...|$|E

These included <b>grinding</b> rapeseed for <b>oil,</b> processing leather, making brass kettles, twisting yarn, and manufacturing sheet lead. Gunpowder production at the mills led to a tragedy on the night before Easter 1690, when Peter Pain (a Huguenot refugee from Dieppe) was blown up together with two of the mills, three stone houses, and a vast quantity of gunpowder manufactured by him for the government.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study aimed at determining the residual stress which results from developing the surface layer by low-pressure and conventional carburizing and grinding of 17 CrNi 6 - 6 steel. A synergistic effect of thermochemical and abrasive treatment was examined on ring samples used to study residual stress by Davidenkov’s method. Samples were subjected to vacuum carburizing and conventional carburizing, which was followed by grinding with a 38 A 60 K 8 V aloxite grinding wheel and a CBN grinding wheel - RNB 80 / 63 B 75 V. The following cutting fluids were used during the <b>grinding</b> process: <b>oil</b> emulsion 5 %, supply rate ca. 20 l/min, Micro 5000 oil supplied at the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) of ca. 25 ml/h, dry machining. The study determined the effect of the type of grinding wheel and the cooling and lubricating agent on the distribution of residual stress in the sur-face layer. The best effects of grinding with respect to the residual stress were achieved with flood cooling with <b>oil</b> emulsion and <b>grinding</b> with a CBN grinding wheel...|$|R
5000|$|They were aided {{greatly in}} this by {{innovations}} in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance, painters had to <b>grind</b> pigment, add <b>oil</b> and thus {{create their own}} paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors {{at a time and}} fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out. in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored. [...] Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For {{the first time since the}} Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{machining}} (cutting, grinding etc.) {{is conducted}} in manufacturing. Machining fluid (cutting <b>oil,</b> <b>grinding</b> fluid) {{that consists of}} oil, surface active agent, and extreme pressure agent, anti rust agent etc. is used. It improves machining performance, but it needs waste fluid disposal that is incineration or coagulative precipitation and so on. It causes huge cost and environmental load. Furthermore, it is afraid of workers health hazard for several chemicals while machining. Therefore, the electric rust preventive machining method system (water machining) is proposed and developed. This method uses only harmless water (tap water etc.) as machining fluid. In this paper, improvement of electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system {{that is part of}} water recycle system which is used for machining water purification and re-use. On long time (3 days) preservation of iron chip in water, decreasing of rust and turbidity is examined. Improved electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system is equipped simple circulation filter unit newly and its effectiveness is clarified. When many quantity of iron powder (3 kg) likened to actual sludge is sunken in sedimentation water tank, if electric rust prevention and simple circulation filter activated, turbidity and colour would be decreased greatly. Therefore, it is expected that purification load of next part of filters is decreased and life-time of filter and system will be prolonged...|$|R
40|$|As known, Malaysia is {{the second}} largest palm oil {{producer}} worldwide after Indonesia, therefore indicating the abundance of its wastes within the country. The plantation would be seen to increase to at least 5. 2 million ha by 2020, and the waste generation would be 50 - 70 times the plantation. However, the efficiency of bulk density is reduced. This {{is one of the}} main reasons of the initiation of this size reduction/ grinding research. With appropriate parameters, grinding will be seen to be helping in enhancing the inter-particle bindings, subsequently increasing the quality of final products. This paper focuses on the grinding quality involving palm oil wastes by using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The samples would first be ground to powder at varying grinding speed and finally got the randomly chosen particles measured to obtain the size range. The grinding speed was manipulated from 15 Hz to 40 Hz. From the data obtained, it was found the particles fineness increased with increasing grinding speed. In general, the size ranged from 45 μm to about 600 μm, where the finest was recorded at the speed of 40 Hz. It was also found that the binding was not so encouraging at very low speeds. Therefore, the optimum <b>grinding</b> speed for <b>oil</b> palm residues lied in the range of 25 Hz to 30 Hz. However, there were still limitations to be overcome if the accuracy of the image clarity is to be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of fuel ethanol in the United States {{is produced by}} using the dry-grind corn ethanol process. The corn oil that is contained in the coproduct, distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS), can be recovered {{for use as a}} biodiesel feedstock. Oil removal will also improve the feed quality of DDGS. The most economical way to remove oil is considered to be at the centrifugation step for separating thin stillage (liquid) from coarse solids after distilling the ethanol. The more oil there is in the liquid, the more it can be recovered by centrifugation. Therefore, we studied the effects of corn preparation and <b>grinding</b> methods on <b>oil</b> distribution between liquid and solid phases. Grinding the corn to three different particle sizes, flaking, flaking and grinding, and flaking and extruding were used to break up the corn kernel before fermentation, and their effects on oil distribution between the liquid and solid phases were examined by simulating an industrial decanter centrifuge. Total oil contents were measured in the liquid and solids after centrifugation. Dry matter yield and oil partitioning in the thin stillage were highly positively correlated. Flaking slightly reduced bound fat. The flaked and then extruded corn meal released the highest amount of free oil, about 25 % compared to 7 % for the average of the other treatments. The freed oil from flaking, however, became nonextractable after the flaked corn was ground. Fine grinding alone had little effect on oil partitioning...|$|R
40|$|Palm {{oil fuel}} ash {{is a waste}} {{material}} {{that can be used}} as partial cement replacement. However, its reactivity as pozzolanic material depends {{on the size of the}} particle. This paper presents the effects of nano size palm oil fuel ash on the long term characteristics of mortar. The study covers basic properties of mortar including the morphology, porosity, compressive strength and microstructural with regards to the variations in the mix design of the mortar. The palm oil fuel ash used has gone through heat treatment and was ground to a nano size with the percentage replacement of cement used was 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. The different types of mortar samples were cast in a 70 x 70 x 70 mm cube for compressive strength test. All casting and testing of the samples were conducted in the laboratory at ambient temperature. The results show that the use of 80 % nano size palm oil fuel ash has produced higher compressive strength at the age of 28 days by 32 % compared to the control mortar. <b>Grinding</b> the palm <b>oil</b> fuel ash to a nano size particle has improved the reactivity of the ash and because of it is a waste material it reduces the cost of the mortar. The experimental result also show that the compressive strength of the 80 % nano size palm oil fuel ash mortar at 365 days was 25 % higher than its strength at 28 days. In addition, the porosity of the 80 % nano palm oil fuel ash mortar was reduced by 51 % at the age of 1 year. The overall results have revealed that the use of high volume nano palm oil fuel ash can enhances the mortar properties and due to the high percentage of replacement it can contribute to a more sustainable construction...|$|R
30|$|To make {{a convincing}} {{reconstruction}} of Van Gogh’s palette, we need pigments and binders that resemble {{those used by}} Van Gogh. Fortunately, Van Gogh’s paints have thoroughly been investigated [1, 2, 12, 16, 17], providing us with much information on the properties our paint reconstructions should mimic. Also, {{in the past several}} reconstructions were made of Van Gogh’s paints. Carlyle set the standard in the HART (Historically Accurate Reconstructions Techniques) Project conducted from 2002 to 2006 as part of the De Mayerne Programme, in which both oil paint and ground reconstructions were made with as much accuracy as feasible in order to explore historical recipes and workshop practices [18]. Part of the project involved the reconstruction of Van Gogh’s grounds and white paints in order to investigate their working properties [19]. In the same period several of Van Gogh’s red lake paints were reconstructed as part of a collaborative project on the ‘Fading of red lake paints after Vincent van Gogh’ led by Klaas Jan van den Berg (Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands). The paint reconstructions, based on analysis of Van Goghs paints and using 19 th-century English and French recipes, were prepared in two workshops: one on pigment preparation led by Jo Kirby and David Saunders (formerly National Gallery, London, United Kingdom) [20] and another on <b>grinding</b> pigments with <b>oil</b> to make paints under the guidance of Leslie Carlyle. Also, the paint outs were artificially aged to better understand the color changes that have taken place in Van Gogh’s paintings [3]. This provided a wealth of information about the handling properties, color and aging behavior of his paints. However, it also revealed the limitations of the experimental approach: lack of information on the recipes used by 19 th century paint manufacturers in general and those of Van Gogh in particular, as well as the 21 st-century laboratory scale conditions used, restricted the historical accuracy of the paint preparations that could be accomplished [18, 19]. While additional information on 19 th century recipes and the composition of Van Gogh paints has become available since then, these constraints will never be fully overcome. Moreover, when reconstructing Van Goghs full palette, further compromises had to be made due to practical limitations and time constraints.|$|R
40|$|High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) {{combines}} high {{depths of}} cut, high grinding wheel speeds with high work piece feed rates {{to deliver a}} very high stock removal process that can produce components free of surface damage. High contact temperatures are a characteristic {{of the process and}} this produces a mass of hot grinding sparks being ejected from the <b>grinding</b> zone. Neat <b>oil</b> cutting fluids are typically used in HEDG due to their excellent lubricity, but the high grinding wheel speeds employed leads to high levels of highly volatile cutting fluid mist in the machine canopy. This mist can mix with the hot grinding sparks being ejected from the grinding zone to create a potential fire hazard. The project aim was to produce a cutting fluid application strategy for the HEDG regime, focusing on establishing the thermal characteristics of cutting fluids {{in order to determine the}} optimum cutting fluid for the HEDG process. The cutting fluid application strategy also involved investigating the optimum means by which to apply the cutting fluid, based on minimising amount of cutting fluid used in the process and in reducing the potential fire hazard. The characteristics that have a thermal impact on the grinding process are the cooling, lubrication, ignition and misting properties of the fluid. A series of tests were established to investigate these properties and therefore allow different fluids to be compared and contrasted for their suitability for the HEDG regime based. Once an optimal cutting fluid had been established, the project then investigated the optimal method of applying this fluid, with particular reference to the type and design of the nozzle used to apply the fluid to the grinding zone. As part of these trials, a series of benchmark tests were also conducted using long established cutting fluid application techniques to enable the benefits of the new strategy to be evaluated. The project concluded that high viscosity neat oil ester based cutting fluids were the best fluids to be used in the HEDG regime due to they excellent lubricity and low misting properties coupled to their relatively high resistance to ignition when compared to neat mineral oils. The studies also found that using a high viscosity ester based fluid and then applying it using a coherent jet nozzle, significant reductions in the grinding powder and specific grinding energy could be achieved whilst significantly lowering the amount of mist in the machine, thus reducing the potential fire hazard and the volume of cutting fluid used by the process...|$|R
6000|$|... 136. But if, {{on the one}} hand, mere {{abstract}} {{excellence of}} color be thus coldly regarded, it is equally certain that no work ever attains enduring celebrity which is eminently deficient in this great respect. Color cannot be indifferent; it is either beautiful and auxiliary to {{the purposes of the}} picture, or false, froward, and opposite to them. Even in the painting of Nature herself, this law is palpable; chiefly glorious when color is a predominant element in her working, she is in the next degree most impressive when it is withdrawn altogether: and forms and scenes become sublime in the neutral twilight, which were indifferent in the colors of noon. Much more is this the case in the feebleness of imitation; all color is bad which is less than beautiful; all is gross and intrusive which is not attractive; it repels where it cannot inthrall, and destroys what it cannot assist. It is besides the painter's peculiar craft; he who cannot color is no painter. It is not painting to <b>grind</b> earths with <b>oil</b> and lay them smoothly on a surface. He only is a painter who can melodize and harmonize hue--if he fail in this, he is no member of the brotherhood. Let him etch, or draw, or carve: better the unerring graver than the unfaithful pencil--better the true sling and stone than the brightness of the unproved armor. And let not even those who deal in the deeper magic, and feel in themselves the loftier power, presume upon that power--nor believe in the reality of any success unless that which has been deserved by deliberate, resolute, successive operation. We would neither deny nor disguise the influences of sensibility or of imagination, upon this, as upon every other admirable quality of art;--we know that there is that in the very stroke and fall of the pencil in a master's hand, which creates color with an unconscious enchantment--we {{know that there is a}} brilliancy which springs from the joy of the painter's heart--a gloom which sympathizes with its seriousness--a power correlative with its will; but these are all vain unless they be ruled by a seemly caution--a manly moderation--an indivertible foresight. This we think the one great conclusion to be received from the work we have been examining, that all power is vain--all invention vain--all enthusiasm vain--all devotion even, and fidelity vain, unless these are guided by such severe and exact law as we see take place in the development of every great natural glory; and, even in the full glow of their bright and burning operation, sealed by the cold, majestic, deep-graven impress of the signet on the right hand of Time.|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{position}} of sea-level, {{pointed out by}} related deposits and morphologies, provide useful markers to estimate tectonic uplift rates. For the Holocene very high uplift rates are misured in the northeast Sicily coast (Antonioli et al., 2009). This study compare vertical tectonic movements and marine geology data in the coastal sector between Capo d’Orlando and Brolo (NE Sicily); tectonic lineaments show different trends both onland (Nigro & Sulli, 1995) and offshore (Nicolich et al., 1982) and also the morphological response follow closely this difference. The geomorphologic survey provided data on Holocene uplift rates. We studied an archaeological ancient quarry of <b>grinding</b> wheels for <b>oil</b> that {{has been found in}} the Capo d’Orlando inshore (Scicchitano et al., 2011). They present semi submerged circular holes in Stilo-Capo d’Orlando deposits (Carbone et al., 1998). The tectonic uplift was evaluated as the difference between the observed local paleo-sea level position and the predicted sea-level curve for the same locality (Lambeck et al., 2011). The resulting uplift rates is 0. 36 mm/yr (Scicchitano et al., 2011). In this area we studied also the Brolo stack. It is a metamorphic rocks emerging at 450 m from the coastline. The study led to discovery a fossils-bearing conglomerate in protected trays at 3. 5 m a. s. l [...] Radiocarbon analysis on a gastropod, gave us an age of 4965 years +- 70 cal BP. If we compare this data with the predicted local sea level curves (Lambeck et al., 2011), we obtain an uplift rate about 1. 5 mm/yr (Lo Presti et al., 2010), which is higher than that calculated in the study of archaeological rest. A detailed study of Brolo sector show us different morphological coastline {{position of}} Brolo plain. A picture of the year 1847 shows the coastline about 200 m landward. In Brolo coastal plain we have also found a Spondylus at - 6 m b. s. l. We wait for the radiocarbon dating which allows us to have a new uplift rate data. The analysis of marine geology data (Multibeam) evidenced structures connected to different faults systems, such as the submarine canyons that are the continuation of river beds. Multibeam data evidenced also tilted NE-ward submerged surfaces, indicating existing structural movements, interesting only restricted areas. So, very different uplift rates in the Holocene in very close areas distant only about 10 kilometers: both 0. 36 mm/yr (Scicchitano et al. 2011) and 1. 5 mm/yr (Lo Presti et al. 2010), and morphobathymetric data (tilted surfaces), evidence the important role of active tectonic lineaments. Seismic reflection profiles support this assumption, showing the metamorphic basement strongly dissected by high-angle faults, which at place determines the occurrence of emergent rock bodies (e. g. the Brolo stack). All this suggesting the occurrence of “restricted regions” in the coastal-marine sector with different geological behavior as response to prominent tectonic releasing bands, determining their horizontal and vertical movements...|$|R
