40|$|Brown coal is {{considered}} to be a competitive primary energy source for power generation in parts of Central and Eastern Europe due to the <b>economically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of this fuel in these regions. On the other side, it is well known that brown coal contains significant amounts of moisture which decreases the overall plant thermal efficiency due to the increased flue gas thermal loses. In order to keep the competitive edge of brown coal, an improvement of the power plant efficiency is required. One way to achieve this target is to dry the moist brown coal before combustion. Conventionally, the necessary moisture extraction process is integrated into milling, where a recirculated flue gas stream is used as a drying agent. External brown coal drying offers the potential to increase the net thermal efficiency of the entire power generation process by up to 5 % points. This paper presents a description of the technical fundamentals of drying techniques developed and successfully tested so far. Furthermore, it presents computer simulation studies for the integration of an external dryer into a steam cycle of a Greek brown coal-fired power plant as a typical test to demonstrate the potential of the drying technologies for power generation. The major objectives of these studies are to formulate basic drying schemes which might be integrated into a power production steam cycle. Three dryers using steam as a drying agent, e. g. the tubular dryer, the fluidised bed dryer and the mechanical thermal dewatering process are compared to the conventional flue gas drying technology using a computer simulation.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 One of {{the major}} issues facing the coal {{industry}} today is the decline in <b>economically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves,</b> especially in the Witbank 1 Mpumalanga region of South Africa. This necessitates a critical review of alternate coal sources. One such source was identified as previously discarded and currently arising coal fines. It {{is well known that}} great value lies within these fines, but that the high moisture content associated with fine coal leads to thermal inefficiencies, handling problems and increased transport cost. This study will investigate thermal drying as a feasible solution to effectively remove this moisture. During thermal drying coal is fed into a high temperature environment; this can influence the physical and mechanical properties of the coal. The effects include swelling, caking, cracking, loss of water, loss of volatiles, and many more. These effects are investigated by means of thennogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with a heating stage, proximate analysis and mercury intrusion. Coal samples with an average particle size of 500 um were selected for this study. It was found that: The rate of moisture loss up to temperatures between 150 and 200 °C is at a maximum where after the rate declines up to temperatures between 350 and 450 °C when primary devolatilisation initiates. No visual changes in the coal are observed up to temperatures between 350 and 450 °C. A limited amount of volatiles evolve at a constant rate up to 250 °C; this is not significant enough to decrease the calorific value of the coal. Porosity changes in the coal are observed from temperatures as low as 250 °C. Thermal drying was found to be a feasible alternative to currently employed drying methods with 150 °C selected as the optimal drying temperature. A thermal drying plant is proposed with recommendations for future work needed to realise such a plant. Master...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} opportunity to recover bypassed oil from depleted, mature oilfields in the US. The recovery factor in many reservoirs is low due to inefficient displacement of the oil by injected fluids (typically water). The use of chemical flooding methods to increase recovery efficiencies is severely constrained by {{the inability of the}} injected chemicals to contact the bypassed oil. Low sweep efficiencies are the primary cause of low oil recoveries observed in the field in chemical flooding operations even when lab studies indicate high oil recovery efficiency. Any technology that increases the ability of chemical flooding agents to better contact the remaining oil and reduce the amount of water produced in conjunction with the produced oil will {{have a significant impact on}} the cost of producing oil domestically in the US. This translates directly into additional <b>economically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves,</b> which extends the economic lives of marginal and mature wells. The objective of this research project was to develop a low-cost, pH-triggered polymer for use in IOR processes to improve reservoir sweep efficiency and reservoir conformance in chemical flooding. Rheological measurements made on the polymer solution, clearly show that it has a low viscosity at low pH and exhibits a sudden increase in viscosity (by 2 orders of magnitude or more) at a pH of 3. 5 to 4. This implies that the polymer would preferentially flow into zones containing water since the effective permeability to water is highest in these zones. As the pH of the zone increases due to the buffering capacity of the reservoir rock, the polymer solution undergoes a liquid to gel transition causing a sharp increase in the viscosity of the polymer solution in these zones. This allows operationally robust, in-depth conformance treatment of such water bearing zones and better mobility control. The rheological properties of HPAM solutions were measured. These include: steady-shear viscosity and viscoelastic behavior as functions of pH; shear rate; polymer concentration; salinity, including divalent ion effects; polymer molecular weight; and degree of hydrolysis. A comprehensive rheological model was developed for HPAM solution rheology in terms of: shear rate; pH; polymer concentration; and salinity, so that the spatial and temporal changes in viscosity during the polymer flow in the reservoir can be accurately modeled. A series of acid coreflood experiments were conducted to understand the geochemical reactions relevant for both the near-wellbore injection profile control and for conformance control applications. These experiments showed that the use hydrochloric acid as a pre-flush is not viable because of the high reaction rate with the rock. The use of citric acid as a pre-flush was found to be quite effective. This weak acid has a slow rate of reaction with the rock and can buffer the pH to below 3. 5 for extended periods of time. With the citric acid pre-flush the polymer could be efficiently propagated through the core in a low pH environment i. e. at a low viscosity. The transport of various HPAM solutions was studied in sandstones, in terms of permeability reduction, mobility reduction, adsorption and inaccessible pore volume with different process variables: injection pH, polymer concentration, polymer molecular weight, salinity, degree of hydrolysis, and flow rate. Measurements of polymer effluent profiles and tracer tests show that the polymer retention increases at the lower pH. A new simulation capability to model the deep-penetrating mobility control or conformance control using pH-sensitive polymer was developed. The core flood acid injection experiments were history matched to estimate geochemical reaction rates. Preliminary scale-up simulations employing linear and radial geometry floods in 2 -layer reservoir models were conducted. It is clearly shown that the injection rate of pH-sensitive polymer solutions can be significantly increased by injecting it at a pH below 3. 5 (at a fixed bottom-hole pressure). This improvement in injectivity by a factor of 2 to 10 can have a significant impact on the economics of chemical flooding and conformance control applications. Simulation tools and experimental data presented in this report help to design and implement such polymer injection projects...|$|E
