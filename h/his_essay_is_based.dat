40|$|This essay explores Emerson’s {{reflections}} on self-reliance with particular reference to Emerson’s {{understanding of the}} concept of self-reliance, his view of ‘conformity’ as the major obstacle to self-reliance, and the moral significance of <b>his</b> thought. The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on the premise that Emerson’s philosophy of self-reliance, self-reference and self-responsibility has a relevance and an application to our contemporary lives which are often conducted through subtle shades of compliance and acquiescence to popular opinion and prevailing fashions of thought and behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practices of}} botanical collectors in nineteenthcentury Van Diemen’s Land, their involvement in the Flora Tasmaniae and their contribution to broader scientific debates. When Joseph Hooker wrote <b>his</b> introductory <b>essay</b> on the Australian flora for Flora Tasmaniae in 1859, {{it was the first}} published case study supporting Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Much of Hooker’s evidence for <b>his</b> <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on plant material collected by self-trained resident naturalists of Van Diemen's Land, including Robert Lawrence, Ronald Gunn and William Archer. In recent years Darwin, Hooker and their contemporaries have been thoroughly examined, but as yet there has been little concentration upon the colonial collectors who contributed to their research. Instead of a centre-periphery study, this thesis provides a periphery-centre focus, exploring the role of the colonial naturalists, their contribution to the development of scientific knowledge, and the realities of operating as naturalists in the Antipodes. This thesis argues that resident colonial collectors in Van Diemen's Land made a significant contribution to botanical science during a time of taxonomic and classificatory flux. By using correspondence, journals, plant specimens and collecting notes this thesis examines one facet of a larger imperial movement. Analysis of these sources demonstrates the nuances of the colonial scientific experience, how knowledge was gained, how contacts and friendships were made and sustained, and what sort of work self-trained enthusiasts undertook. Numerous men and women contributed to a broad discussion on the native flora and fauna, including landed gentlemen, medical men, public servants and convicted criminals. As the Flora grew from their efforts, colonists questioned the source of power in the scientific world. This thesis discusses these changing tensions, and how those with a deeper local understanding balanced their colonial knowledge with the views of those in the metropole...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> to show and discuss how {{different}} problems in American law are depicted in three novels by Scott Turow. The themes that will be discussed are corruption, abuse {{of power and the}} idea of truth, themes which are frequently portrayed in <b>his</b> novels. The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> on three texts, Presumed Innocent which is his first published novel, Pleading Guilty his third novel, and Reversible Errors which was his sixth novel. In chapter one of this essay the problem of corruption is discussed and how ambiguity affects the characters and that no individual is above temptation. Chapter two deals with abuse of power. This chapter discusses and explains how many characters in the American legal system use their positions and power to influence cases and people. The third chapter reflects upon the elusiveness of truth and how ineffective the criminal-justice system really is as a truth-finding mechanism. This chapter illustrates how complicated it can be to find out the most simple truth and how the truth can sometimes both help and destroy guilty as well as innocent people.
