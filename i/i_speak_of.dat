He cried monotonously, in a dull, hopeless way. For an entire hour there had been an awful chorus of shrieks, gradually dying into a hopeless moan, until this last cry that <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of.</b> Then all was silent." [...] Lowe and his crew found four men still alive, one of whom died shortly afterwards. Otherwise, all they could see were [...] "hundreds of bodies and lifebelts"; the dead [...] "seemed as if they had perished with the cold as their limbs were all cramped up." ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Concurrently, Weizmann devoted {{himself to}} the {{establishment}} of a scientific institute for basic research in the vicinity of his sprawling estate, in the town of Rehovot. Weizmann saw great promise in science as a means to bring peace and prosperity to the area. As stated in his own words : [...] "I trust and feel sure in my heart that science will bring to this land both peace and a renewal of its youth, creating here the springs of a new spiritual and material life. [...] <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> both science for its own sake and science as a means to an end." [...] His efforts led in 1934 {{to the creation of the}} Daniel Sieff Research Institute, which was financially supported by an endowment by Israel Sieff in memory of his late son. Weizmann actively conducted research in the laboratories of this institute, primarily in the field of organic chemistry. [...] He offered the post of director of the institute to Nobel Prize laureate Fritz Haber, but took over the directorship himself after Haber's death en route to Palestine.|$|E

2500|$|The play {{opened on}} 17 January 1904, the director's birthday, at the Moscow Art Theatre under the {{direction}} of the actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski. During rehearsals, the structure of Act Two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov's wishes, Stanislavski's version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had [...] "ruined" [...] his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone... Not once does my Anya cry, nowhere do <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> a tearful tone, in the second act there are tears in their eyes, but the tone is happy, lively. Why did you speak in your telegram about so many tears in my play? Where are they? ... Often you will find the words [...] "through tears," [...] but I am describing only the expression on their faces, not tears. And in the second act there is no graveyard." [...] The playwright's wife Olga Knipper played Madame Ranevskaya in the original Moscow Art Theatre production, as well as in the 300th production of the play by the theatre in 1943.|$|E
