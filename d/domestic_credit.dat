40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the possible co-integration and the direction of causality between financial development, international trade and economic growth in India. Design/methodology/approach – Annual data covering the 1965 - 2004 period have been used {{to investigate}} co-integration and Granger causality tests between financial development, international trade, and growth after employing unit root tests to see if the variables under consideration are stationary. Findings – Results reveal that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between financial development, international trade and real income growth in the case of India. Furthermore, unidirectional causality was investigated that runs from real income to exports and imports, from exports to imports, M 2 and <b>domestic</b> <b>credits,</b> from M 2 to imports, from imports to <b>domestic</b> <b>credits.</b> Bidirectional causality has also been obtained between real income and M 2, and between real income and <b>domestic</b> <b>credits.</b> Finally, no direction of causality has been obtained between M 2 and <b>domestic</b> <b>credits.</b> Research limitations/implications – Expanded data can be used for further comparison. Practical implications – This study has shown that the supply-leading and the demand-following hypotheses cannot be inferred for the Indian economy alone themselves. And furthermore, the export-led and the import-led hypotheses again cannot be inferred for the Indian economy based on the sample period, 1965 - 2004. Originality/value – This study is {{the first of its kind}} which investigates the possible co-integration and the direction of causality between the financial development, international trade and economic growth triangle not only in the case of India but also in the relevant literature to the best of one's knowledge.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} some major macroeconomic variables on construction sector activity in Turkey by employing a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model from 1990 Q 1 to 2010 Q 3. The 4 -variable VAR model includes the log of construction sector activity (COACT), the log of real gross domestic product (RGDP), weighted averages of 12 -month interest rate on deposit (INT) and the log of banking sector total <b>domestic</b> <b>credits</b> (CRE). According to VAR model impulse response analysis, the sector booms related to a positive one standard deviation shock in RGDP. Thereby, the importance of maintaining economic stabilization is revealed since economic contractions may affect the sector negatively. In addition to this finding, impulse response analysis indicates that a positive one standard deviation shock in INT deteriorates the construction sector activity. Therefore, interest rates should be kept low by the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Moreover, impulse response analysis results emphasize that credit supply and demand should be equalized for minimizing default risk. On the other hand, forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) analysis infers the importance of real gross domestic product, weighted averages of 12 -month interest rate on deposit and banking sector total <b>domestic</b> <b>credits</b> in determining construction sector activity. </p...|$|R

Given the recent experience of military operations in the Russo-Japanese War, Schlieffen resorted to an assumption that international trade and <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> could not bear a long war and this tautology justified Vernichtungsstrategie. Grand strategy, a comprehensive approach to warfare, that took in economics and politics as well as military considerations, was beyond the capacity of the Great General Staff (as it was among the general staffs of rival powers). Moltke (the Younger) found that he could not dispense with Schlieffen's offensive concept, because of the objective constraints that had led to it. Moltke was less certain and continued to plan for a short war, while urging the civilian administration to prepare for a long one, which only managed to convince people that he was indecisive.|$|E

60|$|As to our commerce, the {{imports and}} exports of the nation, now six-and-forty million, did not then amount to ten. The inland trade, which is {{commonly}} passed by {{in this sort of}} estimates, but which, in part growing out of the foreign, and connected with it, is more advantageous and more substantially nutritive to the state, is not only grown in a proportion of near five to one as the foreign, but has been augmented at least in a tenfold proportion. When I came to England, I remember but one river navigation, the rate of carriage on which was limited by an act of Parliament. It was made in the reign of William the Third. I mean that of the Aire and Calder. The rate was settled at thirteen pence. So high a price demonstrated the feebleness of these beginnings of our inland intercourse. In my time, one of the longest and sharpest contests I remember in your House, and which rather resembled a violent contention amongst national parties than a local dispute, was, as well as I can recollect, to hold the price up to threepence. Even this, which a very scanty justice to the proprietors required, was done with infinite difficulty. As to private credit, there were not, as I believe, twelve bankers' shops at that time out of London. In this their number, when I first saw the country, I cannot be quite exact; but certainly those machines of <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> were then very few. They are now in almost every market-town: and this circumstance (whether the thing be carried to an excess or not) demonstrates the astonishing increase of private confidence, of general circulation, and of internal commerce,--an increase out of all proportion to the growth of the foreign trade. Our naval strength in the time of King William's war was nearly matched by that of France; and though conjoined with Holland, then a maritime power hardly inferior to our own, even with that force we were not always victorious. Though finally superior, the allied fleets experienced many unpleasant reverses on their own element. In two years three thousand vessels were taken from the English trade.

40|$|Firms in {{developing}} countries cite credit constraints {{as one of their}} primary obstacles to investment. Direct foreign investment, by bringing in scarce capital, may ease <b>domestic</b> firms' <b>credit</b> constraints. Alternatively, if foreign firms borrow heavily from domestic banks, they may exacerbate <b>domestic</b> firms' <b>credit</b> constraints by crowding them out of domestic capital markets. One plausible mechanism by which this may happen is indirect. Foreign firms may be more experienced and have better financial ratios and thus, be a safer bet for lending institutions. Using firm-level data from the Ivory Coast for the period 1974 - 1987 we test the following hypotheses: (1) domestic firms are more credit constrained than foreign firms and (2) borrowing by foreign firms exacerbates the <b>credit</b> constraints of <b>domestic</b> firms. Results suggest that domestic firms are significantly more credit constrained that foreign firms and that borrowing by foreign firms aggravates <b>domestic</b> firms' <b>credit</b> constraints. By splitting the sample into state-owned (SOE) and privately owned domestic enterprises we are able to show that SOEs are less financially constrained than other domestic enterprises, consistent with the notion of a 'soft budget constraint'. Borrowing by foreign firms affects only privately owned enterprises. Finally, we explore possible explanations for the crowding out effect. ...|$|R

The friction amplifies the effects of external financial shocks, especially when the economy is highly indebted in foreign currency. For a set of Latin American economies, the theoretical model is calibrated to match the empirical impulse responses of output, investment, trade balance, and <b>domestic</b> <b>credits</b> in response to an adverse shock to the country risk premium.
