During this segment of the tour, a kiss cam was featured on the Jumbotron of the hosting arena. The performance also featured a red and white <b>gingham</b> horse during select shows. During a performance on February 22, Cyrus kissed recording artist Katy Perry {{in the middle of}} the track, which resulted in a minor conflict between the women. During a later showing on February 27, Cyrus invited Matt Peterson, who notably asked Cyrus to his high school prom through YouTube that January, onstage while she sang.|$|E

25|$|Thomas {{left school}} at the age 15 to help support her siblings. She got a job selling <b>gingham</b> at Joseph Horne's {{department}} store for $2.75 per week. In April 1911, aged 16, she married Bernard Krugh Thomas in McKees Rocks, a small mill town. During the two-year marriage, she reportedly worked as a clerk in Kaufmann's, a major department store in Pittsburgh. After their separation in 1913, Thomas moved to New York City and lived with a family member. She later found work in a Harlem department store.|$|E
50|$|By 1917, the Whittenton Manufacturing Company was {{capitalized}} at $600,000, with Arthur Lyman as president. It contained 45,040 spindles and 1,640 looms, {{and produced}} <b>ginghams</b> and blankets.|$|R
5000|$|A Mr Smith built a small cotton mill in Boothstown Delph by the Stirrup Brook in 1812. In 1891 Edward Makin of Garden Mill had 260 looms weaving [...] "regattas, stripes, <b>ginghams</b> etc." [...] and William Yates' Boothstown Mill had 9,000 {{spindles}} and 242 looms producing fine quality cotton from 1875 {{until the}} mill closed in 1968.|$|R
2500|$|Construction on {{the current}} Everett Mill main {{building}} commenced in 1909 and lasted for one year. When completed, {{it was the largest}} cotton mill under one roof in the world. With this addition the company employed 2,100 people (over half of whom were female), operated 4,728 looms and produced 1.2 million yards of cotton cloth every week. This was almost double what the mill had produced just the year before. They were nationally known for their high-quality <b>ginghams,</b> denims and shirtings, referred to as “Everett Classics. ” ...|$|R
25|$|Biba's {{early years}} were rather humble, {{with many of}} the outfits being cheap and {{available}} to the public by mail order. Biba’s postal boutique had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink <b>gingham</b> dress with a hole cut {{out of the back of}} the neck with a matching triangular kerchief to readers of the Daily Mirror. The dress had celebrity appeal, as a similar dress had been worn by Brigitte Bardot. By the morning after the dress was advertised in the Daily Mirror, over 4,000 orders had been received. Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold.|$|E
500|$|Horsefield {{learned to}} read during a single year's {{attendance}} at school when he was six, after which {{he went to work}} for a <b>gingham</b> weaver. His education continued with twice-weekly evening tuition in writing and arithmetic until he was around 15 years old. James Cash, a journalist, amateur botanist and the first chairman of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society, says Horsefield received some education for a short time when he started work: the weaver for whom he served charged two shillings (10p) per calendar quarter to instruct his young employees in reading. This instruction took the form of the employees reading out lessons to him while they worked at their handlooms. An avid reader, his interest in botany was piqued when he obtained a copy of Nicholas Culpeper's 1653 book, The Complete Herbal, of which he said, [...] "The wonderful properties that are there ascribed to plants excited in me a strong desire to get acquainted with the plants themselves." [...] Thereafter he attended working-men's botanical societies and meetings in public houses, thus meeting a broad church of people with interests not only in the science of botany but also in floriculture, herbalism and horticulture.|$|E
500|$|Cash {{notes that}} when {{constructing}} his orrery, Horsefield asked a local man to manufacture a golden ball {{to represent the}} sun and the man replied that [...] "Aw'll mak' thee one an' charge thee now't for't; but, let me tell thee, fancy folk like thee 're a'lus poor". Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that [...] "fame is not bread". He remained a <b>gingham</b> weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lily– Tigridia conchiflora– in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for £10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage. Horsefield received £13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received £37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another £2 11s (£2.55). N. horsefieldii {{became one of the most}} popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.|$|E
5000|$|Only on {{official}} occasions is the forty or so foot wide bustling downtown thoroughfare of Mariposa called by its proper name, Missinaba Street (after {{the county and}} based on Mississaga Street in Orillia), rather than Main Street. Among the many shops there are Pharmaceutical Hall (Jim Eliot’s drug store), Pete Glover and Alf McNichol's co-located hardware and paint stores and Ed Moore’s photo shop. Similarly, services downtown include lawyers, doctors, dentists, Jefferson [...] "Jeff" [...] Thorpe's barbershop and, when it is all over, Golgotha <b>Gingham's</b> funeral home.|$|R
50|$|Lovering {{retired in}} 1864 and turned {{control of the}} mills over to his three sons, Charles L., William Croad, and Henry Morton Lovering. By 1883, when the company was {{incorporated}} as the Whittenton Manufacturing Company, the factory covered a site of about 15 acres, and contained over 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space, producing a variety of cotton goods, including <b>ginghams,</b> dress goods, fancy tickings, shirtings, flannels, and denims. The facility was powered by five Corliss engines {{with a total of}} 1,200 horsepower, and water wheels providing an additional 250 horsepower.|$|R
5000|$|In 1900, Arthur H. Lowe of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, formed Lowe Manufacturing Company, {{and began}} the {{building}} of Huntsville's fifth textile mill. Lowe Mill opened in 1901 with 25,000 spindles that helped to turn locally-grown cotton into woven cloth. [...] In 1902, Eastern Manufacturing Company built the final large mill in Huntsville, a weaving mill across from Lowe Mill. Lowe Mill and Eastern Manufacturing merged their companies and the two buildings in 1904. The spinning mill supplied yarns for the weaving mills, where the highest grade <b>ginghams</b> and shirtings were made to supply large clothing manufacturers throughout the nation.|$|R

50|$|In the 1810s Armitage and {{his first}} wife set up in {{business}} as drapers at 18 Chapel Street, Salford, then sometime shortly after 1822 {{he set up a}} weaving manufacture business with James Thompson and by 1829 he was employing 29 workers and selling his cloths in Manchester at considerable profit. The business was so successful {{that he was able to}} build a new factory at Pendleton, Salford and eventually employed 200 people making sailcloth, <b>ginghams</b> and checks. By 1848, despite economic slumps he had extended Pendleton New Mill and was employing over 600. In 1867 the Armitages took over the Nassau Mills in Patricroft, Eccles.|$|R

60|$|This castle {{was built}} by William Rufus. David, King of Scots, and Robert Bruce both tried their hands upon it, {{in the good old}} times, when England and Scotland were a mutual robbery association. Then the castle of the town was its great feature; castles were every thing in those days. Now the castle has gone to decay, and stands only for a curiosity, and the cotton factory has come up in its place. This place is famous for cottons and <b>ginghams,</b> and {{moreover}} for a celebrated biscuit bakery. So goes the world,--the lively vigorous shoots of the present springing out of the old, mouldering trunk of the past.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, West's image {{underwent}} a major metamorphosis; {{the woman who}} had once performed outfitted in conservative <b>gingham</b> dresses, and had originally refused to record Kris Kristofferson's [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] because it was [...] "too sexy", began appearing in spandex-sequined Bob Mackie designs. (She had relented in late 1970 and recorded [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] on the album Careless Hands, which was released in 1971.) As the sexual revolution peaked, so did West's career. Under United Artists, West's material changed from traditional country to up-tempo and slow-tempo Adult Contemporary-styled music. In 1977, West released her first album under United Artists, When It's Just You and Me. The title track peaked at No.19 on the country charts.|$|E
60|$|How {{the fire}} started no one ever knew. There was a queer story that went about {{to the effect that}} Mr. Smith and Mr. <b>Gingham's</b> {{assistant}} had been seen very late that night carrying an automobile can of kerosene up the street. But that was amply disproved by the proceedings of the court, and by the evidence of Mr. Smith himself. He took his dying oath,--not his ordinary one as used in the License cases, but his dying one,--that he had not carried a can of kerosene up the street, and that anyway it was the rottenest kind of kerosene he had ever seen and no more use than so much molasses. So that point was settled.|$|R
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in <b>Ginghams</b> and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave {{to start their own}} businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|R
60|$|But Miss Todd {{was not a}} bad woman. She {{spent much}} in feeding those who perhaps were not hungry; but she fed the hungry also: she indulged a good deal in silk brocades; but she bought <b>ginghams</b> as well, and calicos for poor women, and flannel {{petticoats}} for motherless girls. She did go to sleep sometimes in church, and would sit at a whist-table till two o'clock of a Sunday morning; but having been selected from a large family by an uncle as his heir, she had divided her good things with brothers and sisters, and nephews and nieces. And so there were some hearts that blessed her, and some friends who loved her with a love other than that of her friends of Littlebath and Ems, of Jerusalem and Harrowgate.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{they perform}} their project {{on a grand}} scale, they decide to get some {{experience}} by dressing a small business of all-female driving instructors in uniform. A uniform had been optional, {{but all of the}} instructors were keen on the idea. The duo's next step is re-designing the uniform of the catering department at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. To get a feel of what it is like working in these uniforms, Trinny and Susannah spend a few hours working at the establishment. One worker commented [...] "We were surprised. Although they are quite posh, they did have a go. They weren't too worried about slops. Although Susannah did say it was making her ill." [...] Before the renewal of the uniform, it consisted of old-fashioned mismatched items, until it was replaced by matching pink <b>gingham</b> outfits. Then came the task of designing a practical outfit for the Somerfield workers. When the items are made, selected members of Somerfield model the catwalk in the fruit & veg section.|$|E

60|$|Never {{was there}} better company than ever-glorious Jack. The things which most men only read of, or dream about, {{he had seen}} and experienced. He had been a dashing {{smuggler}} in his day, and could tell of a long nine-pounder rammed home with wads of French silks; of cartridges stuffed with the finest gunpowder tea; of cannister-shot full of West India sweetmeats; of sailor frocks and trowsers, quilted inside with costly laces; and table legs, hollow as musket barrels, compactly stowed with rare drugs and spices. He could tell of a wicked widow, too--a beautiful receiver of smuggled goods upon the English coast--who smiled so sweetly upon the smugglers when they sold her silks and laces, cheap as tape and <b>ginghams.</b> She called them gallant fellows, hearts of game; and bade them bring her more.|$|R
6000|$|How {{primitive}} all our notions were! Few of {{the boys}} owned overcoats and the same suit served each of us for summer and winter alike. In lieu of ulsters most of us wore long, gay-colored woolen scarfs wound about our heads and necks--scarfs which our mothers, sisters or sweethearts had knitted for us. Our footwear continued to be boots of the tall cavalry model with pointed toes and high heels. Our collars were either home-made <b>ginghams</b> or [...] "boughten" [...] ones of paper at fifteen cents per box. Some men {{went so far as}} to wear [...] "dickies," [...] that is to say, false shirt fronts made of paper, but this was considered a silly cheat. No one in our neighborhood ever saw a tailor-made suit, and nothing that we wore fitted,--our clothes merely enclosed us.|$|R
60|$|His career {{it would}} be {{difficult}} to prefigure. There appeared to be qualities in Holgrave, such as, in a country where everything is free to the hand that can grasp it, could hardly fail to put some of the world's prizes within his reach. But these matters are delightfully uncertain. At almost every step in life, we meet with young men of just about Holgrave's age, for whom we anticipate wonderful things, but of whom, even after much and careful inquiry, we never happen to hear another word. The effervescence of youth and passion, and the fresh gloss of the intellect and imagination, endow them with a false brilliancy, which makes fools of themselves and other people. Like certain chintzes, calicoes, and <b>ginghams,</b> they show finely in their first newness, but cannot stand the sun and rain, and assume a very sober aspect after washing-day.|$|R

50|$|Rylands was {{the third}} son of Joseph Rylands, a {{manufacturer}} of cotton goods, of St Helens, Lancashire, and his wife Elizabeth (née Pilkington). He was educated at St Helens Grammar School. His aptitude for trade quickly became obvious and manifested itself early and, {{before the age of}} eighteen, he entered into partnership with his elder brothers Joseph and Richard. Their father joined them in 1819, when the firm of Rylands & Sons was established, the seat of operations being established in Wigan. Their manufactures for some years consisted of <b>ginghams,</b> checks, ticks, dowlases, calicoes and linens. John, the youngest partner, occupied himself with travelling over several counties for orders until 1823, when he opened a warehouse for the firm in Manchester. Business increased rapidly, {{and in the course of}} a few years extensive properties at Wigan, along with dye works and bleach works, were purchased. Valuable seams of coal were afterwards discovered under these properties, and proved a great source of wealth to the purchasers.|$|R

60|$|Sounds of clarions drew {{our eyes}} to the Place of the Constitution; and, indeed, I had {{forgotten}} to say, that that majestic square was filled with military, with exceedingly small firelocks, the men ludicrously young and diminutive for the most part, in a uniform at once cheap and tawdry,--like those supplied to the warriors at Astley's, or from still humbler theatrical wardrobes: indeed, the whole scene was just {{like that of a}} little theatre; the houses curiously small, with arcades and balconies, out of which looked women apparently a great deal too big for the chambers they inhabited; the warriors were in <b>ginghams,</b> cottons, and tinsel; the officers had huge epaulets of sham silver lace drooping over their bosoms, and looked as if they were attired at a very small expense. Only the general--the captain-general (Pooch, they told us, was his name: I know not how 'tis written in Spanish)--was well got up, with a smart hat, a real feather, huge stars glittering on his portly chest, and tights and boots of the first order. Presently, after a good deal of trumpeting, the little men marched off the place, Pooch and his staff coming into the very inn in which we were awaiting our chocolate.|$|R
