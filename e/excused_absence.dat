Across those studies school attendance has been identified as a primary correlate with academic success. I used a descriptive non-experimental design to investigate the relationship of student academic outcomes (i. e., GPA, credits earned toward graduation) among student groups (i. e., sex, race, and special education status) on attendance type of unexcused or <b>excused</b> <b>absences.</b> This study included two cohorts of 9 th grade high school students (n = 2, 262) from the Eugene 4 J School District during the 2013 to 2016 school year. I calculated Chi-square tests, Independent t-tests, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient to examine the relationship of attendance with student academic outcomes for GPA and credits earned toward graduation and to further compare attendance type (i. e., unexcused or <b>excused</b> <b>absences)</b> among student groups. Findings indicated statistically significant differences for unexcused and <b>excused</b> <b>absences</b> and for GPA and credits earned by specific demographic subgroups – males v. females, white v. minority, special education v. not special education.

Howely described him as a [...] "big, powerful, bruiser," [...] who hunted wild boar with a machine gun in the woods outside Berlin. [...] "He and I always kept {{one hand on the}} trigger.") [...] At that point Ganeval proposed to close the meeting, but Yelizarov would have none of it. For eight minutes he berated an absent Howley, and offered that the Soviet delegation could no longer remain unless Howley return and apologize to all. Yelizarov headed for the door with Maximov closely in tow, whilst Ganeval reminded them that Howley had been properly excused. The French chairman indicated that it was indeed Yelizarov who was out of order and not Howley. The Russians departed in a maelstrom of confusion, but the record shows Ganeval closed the meeting due to the departure of the Soviet delegation and not Howley's <b>excused</b> <b>absence.</b>|$|E

Vorayudh's car hit the officer and dragged his body some distance. Vorayudh fled the scene, returning home. He subsequently attempted to have an employee at his home take the blame for the crime. Vorayudh was charged with reckless driving causing death, failing to help a crash victim, and speeding. Vorayudh then disappeared. Police failed to indict him for speeding and its statute of limitations expired in 2013. The reckless driving charge will expire in September 2017. Vorayudh has been repeatedly summoned to meet authorities. He has avoided each meeting, his lawyer claiming that he was sick or out of the country on business. Police have failed to capture him and claim to have no clue as to his whereabouts. Bangkok's press maintains that the cases of [...] "Bangkok's deadly rich kids" [...] are handled differently from most deadly car crashes, in which common Thais are arrested, prosecuted, and jailed. Vorayudh failed to show for his latest, 30 March 2017, summons. A spokesman for the Office of the Attorney-General said the defendant is in Britain on personal business and had asked for another postponement. The spokesman declared that Vorayudh's five-year refusal to appear is acceptable because he had filed a complaint of unfair treatment.

40|$|A {{review of}} prior {{research}} {{on the role of}} attendance policies in large lecture classes (including psychology) is presented. This research showed that although students often did not attend class, various policies were effective in getting students to the classroom. Moreover, some research showed that an attendance policy did not lower instructor course evaluation scores compared to when there was no attendance policy. With regard to academic performance, a common finding was a positive correlation between attendance and performance. However, research using experimental designs and archival studies that compared classes with and without policies showed that there was not always an improvement in performance. The importance of pedagogical and practical goals in deciding to implement an attendance policy is presented.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} poor attendance adversely affecting grades and learning. Current school policies do not address problematic attendance for all school-aged children, perpetuating trends of academic failure. The research objective {{was to determine if}} unexcused absences had a greater negative impact on a high-stakes test compared to excused absences and then develop a manual of best attendance policies to better serve all school-aged children. This study sampled 10, 403 students in a southern United States county. Bivariate regression and ANOVA analyses examined the scores students earned on their first attempt at the Social Studies Georgia High School Graduation Test (SSGHSGT) in relation to these students 2 ̆ 7 excused and unexcused absences for grades 9 through 11. Unexcused absences had a significantly greater impact than excused absences on SSGHSGT scores. Scores decreased an average of 1. 33 points for every unexcused absence, whereas each <b>excused</b> <b>absence</b> resulted in a score reduction of only 0. 47 points. Given the need demonstrated by these results, a manual of best practices was developed from initiatives that had been empirically proven successful in preventing absences. The initiatives, drawn from the theoretical foundation of family systems, employ schools, parents, neighborhoods, peers, government agencies, and teachers to cumulatively influence student decisions about attendance. By preventing students from developing problematic attendance, positively impacting student grades, raising graduation rates, and reducing delinquency-related crimes these improvements can create a positive social change for students, parents, and particularly school personnel who are held responsible for academic achievement...|$|E

40|$|Many {{factors may}} impact a student’s {{performance}} on examinations. Factors such as appropriate academic preparation, psychological disposition, {{and social conditions}} all contribute to a student’s success or failure on examinations. This empirical study investigated the effects of unexcused <b>absences</b> and <b>excused</b> <b>absences,</b> as well as ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status on the mathematics and reading achievement scores of eighth grade students, {{as measured by the}} mathematics and reading sections of Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT). Correlation and regression analysis were utilized to assess the relationship between these noted independent variables and student performance on math and reading examinations. The participants for this study included a convenience sample of students who in 2013 - 2014 were enrolled in the eighth grade in the targeted Georgia public school district and were present for the reading and mathematics sections of the CRCT. This study included student demographic data and family socioeconomic status collected from the student information system of the selected Georgia public school district combined with CRCT data results provided to the school district by the Georgia Department of Education. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing awareness of the relationships among types of school absences, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, and academic achievement as determined by test performance in reading and mathematics. Differentiating among unexcused and <b>excused</b> <b>absences</b> will assist educators in determining potential at-risk behavior that impacts student achievement, which could lead to early identification of school or family issues based upon the number of unexcused absences...|$|R
