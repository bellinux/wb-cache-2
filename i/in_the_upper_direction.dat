40|$|It {{seems like}} that backward- bending of labor supply {{function}} {{can be observed}} in Central Asian Countries such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. People’s basic needs of life are satisfied and they do not increase labor supplies even if wage increases. It is possible to find some cases in which slowdowns increase, when a manager in a firm enforces penalties for workers have slowdowns. This phenomenon occurs because a worker prefers the position of equilibrium on the labor supply function always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>direction.</b> This article explains the increase of free-riders by penalties and how to avoid them...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of flow rates and spirometer type on chest wall motion in healthy individuals. Twenty-one healthy volunteers completed breathing trials to either two times tidal volume (2 xVT) or inspiratory capacity (IC) at high, low, or natural flow rates, using a volume-or flow-oriented spirometer. The proportions of rib cage movement to tidal volume (%RC/VT), chest wall diameters, and perceived level of exertion (RPE) were compared. Low and natural flow rates resulted in significantly lower %RC/VT compared to high flow rate trials (p 0. 001) at 2 xVT. Low flow trials also resulted in significantly less chest wall motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> anteroposterior <b>direction</b> than high and natural flow rates (...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of Titan's meteorology is reviewed, including diagnostic inferences {{of the large}} scale wind field and prognostic studies of thermal and momentum balances. Titan's winds were largely inferred from temperature maps whose spatial coverage is incomplete. The inferred winds are cyclostrophic, approximately 75 m/s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> stratosphere. <b>The</b> <b>direction</b> of the winds is ambiguous from the temperature data, but arguments based on the spin up of a planetary atmosphere from an initial state of rest strongly suggest that Titan's winds blow predominantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the planetary rotation. Stratospheric temperatures exhibit a north-south asymmetry, suggesting that seasonal variations are controlled by a dynamical inertia associated {{with the need to}} transport angular momentum as well as heat. A consideration of the global angular momentum balance indicates that the zonally averaged winds near the surface are approximately 0. 3 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Cosmic diffuse gamma-ray fluxes {{have been}} {{measured}} in six energy intervals from 2 to 25 MeV with a balloon-borne gamma-ray telescope. It is {{found that the}} observed fluxes are compatible with an energy distribution of 0. 0265 times E to the - 2. 08 (photon/sq cm-s-sr-MeV) at lower energies and steepen at higher energies to meet a power law of 0. 017 (E/MeV) to the - 2. 4. No deviation of the gamma-ray flux from isotropy is observed for five different times during the balloon flight for 10 -deg intervals up to 50 deg from the zenith and at celestial coordinates varying from latitude - 27 deg, longitude 102 deg to latitude 56 deg, longitude 195 deg, excluding <b>the</b> region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> galactic-anticenter <b>direction.</b> <b>Upper</b> limits to fluxes of 3 - 25 -MeV gamma rays are deduced {{for a number of}} possible galactic and extragalactic sources...|$|R
40|$|Kellogg (1961), {{suggested}} that transport of atomic oxygen {{from the summer}} into the winter hemisphere and subsequent release of energy by three body recombination, O+O+N 2 yields O 2 +N 2 +E, may contribute significantly to the so-called mesopause temperature anomaly. Earlier model calculations have shown that Kellogg's mechanism produces about a 10 -percent increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperature from summer to winter at 90 km. This process, however, is partly compensated by differential heating from absorption of UV radiation associated with dissociation of O 2. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> auroral region of the thermosphere, there is a steady energy dissipation by Joule heating causing a redistribution and depletion of atomic oxygen due to wind-induced diffusion. With the removal of O, latent chemical energy normally released by three body recombination is also removed, {{and the result is}} that the temperature decreases by almost 2 percent near 90 km. Through dynamic feedback, this process reduces the depletion of atomic oxygen by about 25 percent and <b>the</b> temperature perturbation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exosphere from 10 to 7 percent at polar latitudes. Under the influence of the internal dynamo interaction, the prevailing zonal circulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> thermosphere changes <b>direction</b> when the redistribution of recombination energy is considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{moderate}} size intraslab earthquake {{occurred on}} 12 June, 2006 at {{the depth of}} about 145 km <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippine Sea Plate beneath central Oita. Focal mechanism solution determined by F-net shows that this event has a down-dip extension focal mechanism and aftershock activity of this event is very low. Observed displacement waveforms indicate rupture propagates on the east-dipping nodal plane. To investigate source process of this event, inversion of strong motion waveforms is carried out. Result shows complex rupture propagation during this earthquake. Largest slip area is located near the hypocenter. Snapshots show rupture propagates to <b>the</b> right <b>upper</b> <b>direction</b> on <b>the</b> fault plane at first and change to <b>the</b> left <b>upper</b> <b>direction</b> after few seconds. Based on inversion result, the characterized source models of 2006 event are constructed. In this study source models with one and two asperities are proposed. Simulations using the empirical Green's function method suggest that the source model with two asperities is preferable but detail rupture process of this event is much more complex...|$|R
