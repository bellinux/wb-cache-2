In par-ticular, we are interested in if the single payments are capitalized into agricultural land values.

Disadvantages of new-type industrialization in traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> are also analyzed from four aspects of geographical disadvantage, inferior labor quality, informal system disadvantage, and backward non-agricultural industry. At the same time, opportunities for new-type industrialization in traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> are analyzed from three aspects of land system innovation, rural social security system, and financial policy supporting â€œThree Agricultureâ€ development. Threats for the new-type industrialization in traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> are also analyzed from {{the impact of the}} international market on agricultural products, threat of urban industry and threat of other <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> SPSS 16. 0 software and K-Means cluster {{analysis method}} are used to classify the traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> into four categories according to the advantage differences and overall characteristics in traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Strategic modes of new-type industrialization are provided, such as SO strategy (traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> with strong competitiveness), ST strategy (traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> with relatively strong competitiveness), WO strategy (traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> with normal competitiveness) and WT strategy (traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> with weak competitiveness), in order to make strategic mode suitable for different traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> and to offer references fro decision making of government.

The studied water bodies included two large lakes (Bau Sau and Bau Chim), small lakes and ponds, temporary pools, rivers and streams, as well as rice fields and ponds in an <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> beyond the boundaries of the National Park. Fifty three species of Cladocera were found, 18 of them new for Vietnam. Distribution and taxonomical status of the species are discussed. Of the recorded species, 58. 5 % (31) were found only in the National Park, 34 % (18) both in the National Park and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> and only 7. 5 % (4) exclusively in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area.</b> Of the 20 species new for Vietnam, only one was found both in the National Park and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> all others were found in the National Park only.

To this end, methods were developed to assess habitat suitability of indicator bird species, impacts of agricultural measures on farmland birds were analyzed and suggestions for a biodiversity-friendly land-use were derived.

Sufficiently beneficial effects could be reached through ecological focus areas, where these hold high habitat qualities and are large enough.

40|$|Some {{chemical}} compounds used in intensive agriculture {{have been found}} to induce estrogenic effects; therefore a histological analysis of the testes and an evaluation of plasma levels of sex steroid, thyroid hormones, and vitellogenin were carried out in adult male water frogs of two coexisting taxa (Rana lessonae and the hemiclonal hybrid Rana esculenta) sampled in <b>agricultural</b> and pristine <b>areas.</b> Differences in seasonal profiles of hormones were found in water frogs living in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> where the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds was suspected {{on the basis of a}} previous study. In R. esculenta, sampled in the pristine area, high androgen levels were found in May; the opposite trend was found for R. esculenta sampled in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> in which the highest androgen levels were found in September, significantly lower compared with those found in R. esculenta sampled in the pristine area. Low androgen levels were also recorded in R. lessonae males sampled both in pristine and <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas,</b> while the highest levels were found in September. Regarding the trend of estradiol- 17 β, an increase of this hormone was found in July both in esculenta and lessonae sampled in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> and in the same month an estradiol- 17 β peak, even though lower, was also found both in esculenta and lessonae males captured in the pristine area; detectable vitellogenin was found neither in males captured in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> nor in those sampled in the pristine one. Moreover, while no significant changes of thyroid hormones were found either in the esculenta or lessonae males sampled in the pristine area, increased T 3 and T 4 titers were found in July in both esculenta and lessonae captured in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area.</b> Morphological differences of the testes in males of parental species captured in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> were also observed. These findings indicate alterations in endocrine and reproductive function in frogs in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> that could suggest the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The results indicate that schooling and local language ability increase participation in local nonfarm activities and migration. Schooling also is found to increase nonfarm income at the household level but not farm income. We also find that farm household members from low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> are more likely to participate in local nonfarm activities and migration than those from high-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus, the results suggest that local nonfarm activities and migration offer employment opportunities for workers from low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Indeed, the nonfarm activities and migration is likely to provide an important pathway to reduce poverty in low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> in East Africa.
