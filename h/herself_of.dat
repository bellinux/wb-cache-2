5|$|Max {{is given}} the {{opportunity}} to go to San Francisco and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by availing <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> the time travel abilities in the first place. The only way to prevent it is for Max {{to go back to the}} beginning and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay in order to spare Chloe.|$|E
5|$|Paul and Helen {{move to the}} United States, marry, and Helen {{gives birth}} to the narrator. However, she becomes {{depressed}} a few months afterwards. She later confesses that she feared the taint of the vampiric bite that she acquired earlier would infect her child. The family travels to Europe {{in an attempt to}} cheer her up. When they visit the monastery Saint-Matthieu-des-Pyrénées-Orientales, Helen feels Dracula's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff. Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> his threat and her fears.|$|E
5|$|Whitney Russell is {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Eve and T.C. Russell. She is introduced as {{a close friend}} of Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane, but she became prominent on the show as the love interest of Chad Harris-Crane. When Chad is incorrectly identified as Eve and Julian's son, his relationship with Whitney is judged to be incestuous. Whitney's confusion about her relationship with Chad, and her shame at possibly committing incest, escalates after she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their son, Miles Harris-Crane. Whitney briefly becomes estranged from Chad and Harmony, and becomes a nun to absolve <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> the sin of incest. The discovery of Chad's birth certificate proves the couple are not blood relatives; they resume their relationship and eventually marry. Whitney leaves Chad after discovering his affair with Vincent Clarkson. Their later reconciliation is cut short when he is murdered by Alistair Crane. Following Chad's death, Whitney moves to New Orleans to raise Miles, and her unborn child, with the help of Simone. Whitney does not appear on screen after the show moved from NBC to DirecTV, but she is referenced in a telephone call to police chief Sam Bennett and Simone's letter to her best friend Kay Bennett.|$|E

25|$|Ferdinand's {{minority}} {{ended in}} 1767, {{and his first}} act was the expulsion of the Jesuits. The following year he married Archduchess Maria Carolina, daughter of Empress Maria Theresa.

25|$|As soon as Alexander died in 323 BC, Roxana murdered Alexander's {{two other}} wives. Roxana wished to cement her own {{position}} {{and that of}} her son, unborn at that time, by ridding <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> a rival who could be - or claim to be - pregnant. According to Plutarch's account, Stateira's sister, Drypetis, was murdered at the same time; Carney believes that Plutarch was mistaken, and it was actually Parysatis who died with Stateira.|$|E
25|$|Albion was {{launched}} at Topsham, Devon, in 1800. She {{spent most of}} her career sailing between London and Jamaica. After 1814 she held a license from the British East India Company to trade with India, but she {{does not appear to have}} availed <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> the option before she was condemned at Charleston, South Carolina, and broken up in 1816. In 1814 the American privateer Brutus captured Albion, but the British recaptured her within a few days.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{violence}} and its manifestation {{in the sex}} trade becomes {{one of the central}} themes in the book. Both of the main characters lose control of their bodies as they are abused.

However, sexual {{violence and}} terror recurs when Tallinn gets a sex shop that is staffed by ex-KGB, who had perpetuated the violence earlier in the novel. Ultimately, Oksanen successfully captures the horrors inflicted upon women by European military conflicts as well as exploring contemporary sex trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Tyahnybok's {{candidacy}} in the 2010 {{presidential election}} did not {{build on the}} 2009 Ternopil success. Tyahnybok received 1.43% of the vote. Most of his votes he gained in Lviv oblast, Ternopil oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk oblast accounted to 5% of the vote. In the second round, Tyahnybok did not endorse a candidate. He did present a list of some 20 demands for second round candidate Yulia Tymoshenko had to fulfil first before gaining his endorsement—which included publicizing alleged secret deals Tymoshenko had with Vladimir Putin and ridding <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> what he called Ukraine-haters in her close circles.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

After graduating from San Diego High, Loos devised a method of cobbling together published reports of Manhattan social life, mailing them to a friend in New York who would submit them under their own name for publication in San Diego. Her father had turned out some one-act plays for the stock company, and encouraged Anita to work in the field herself. She wrote The Ink Well, a successful piece for which she would receive periodic royalties.|$|E

25|$|While her {{partners}} were seeking {{to meet with}} her, Farmer was already aboard the SS Fürst Bismarck out of New York as a guest of Maria P.

They waited in Egypt where there are pictures of her with Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and scenes there, before leaving for Haifa March 23, 1900.|$|E
25|$|Within the series' narrative, Martha {{begins as}} a medical student who becomes the Doctor's time {{travelling}} companion after an incident at the hospital where she works.

25|$|The pelesit {{is created}} from the tongue {{of a newly}} buried dead body whose mother was also the eldest of her siblings. Its {{appearance}} {{is that of a}} cricket and it is kept in a bottle which is buried if the owner wishes to rid <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> it. In advance of a polong's arrival, the pelesit will enter the body of whomever its mistress has told it to attack. A person who has been thus afflicted might rave about cats. The pelesit is in many ways comparable to the bajang, but whereas the bajang's owner is always male, the pelesit may only be kept by a female. It may be fed on blood from the tip of the fourth finger or, alternatively, with saffron rice. Like the polong, the pelesit can be forced to reveal the name of their owner through magical questioning.|$|E

25|$|Regina confronts Hook at {{the docks}} {{to remind him}} about what {{happened}} back in the Enchanted Forest, but Hook chokes her, saying times have changed. At Granny’s, Mary Margaret, David, and Henry choose to spend their last hours alive, while Emma reveals her plan to Regina {{that she wants to}} sacrifice <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> the darkness inside. Gold then hands over Excalibur to Emma and arranges for Belle to escape town and live her life. Regina and Robin then confront Zelena again, only to have Regina use Merlin's Wand to conjure up a magic tornado to send Zelena to Oz, with Zelena vowing to return. Emma prepares her plan to confront Hook, who appears at her house, but he has the upper hand after he transforms into Henry, fooling her into handing over Excalibur, which leaves her defenseless.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate over}} how much of Genji was {{actually}} written by Murasaki Shikibu {{has gone on for}} centuries and is unlikely to ever be settled unless some major archival discovery is made. It is generally accepted that the tale was finished in its present form by 1021, when the author of the Sarashina Nikki wrote a diary entry about her joy at acquiring a complete copy of the tale. She writes that there are over 50 chapters and mentions a character introduced {{at the end of the}} work, so if other authors besides Murasaki Shikibu did work on the tale, the work was done very near to the time of her writing. Murasaki Shikibu's own diary includes a reference to the tale, and indeed the application to <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> the name 'Murasaki' in an allusion to the main female character. That entry confirms that some if not all of the diary was available in 1008 when internal evidence suggests convincingly that the entry was written.|$|E
25|$|In the forest, Emma, whose {{powers are}} still out of control, wakes up from her vehicle and finds Henry {{standing}} there, telling his mother that everyone was looking for her.

After Henry takes off, Emma is visited by Ingrid, who tells her that she should embrace her true self, but Emma takes off after the conversation, and heads to Gold's Pawn Shop, where Gold, sensing Emma was in the place by the way the items were coming to life, offered her a chance to rid <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> her powers, and gives her a location as to where to meet him; unknown to Emma, Gold has other plans for her. Back at the loft, David, Mary Margaret, Killian and Elsa ponder their next plan by planning another search, when Henry arrives and tells them he found her, but failed to help her regain control of her magic.|$|E
