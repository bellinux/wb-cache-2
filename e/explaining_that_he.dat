5|$|According to legend, Boyce {{was lost}} on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout {{came to his}} aid, guiding {{him back to his}} destination.

Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who {{was the head of the}} Boy Scout Association at that time. Boyce {{returned}} to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} season of The X-Files, Deep Throat {{provided}} Mulder and Scully with information {{they would have been}} otherwise unable to obtain.

Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E

5|$|In March 1944, MacArthur {{met with}} Curtin and {{detailed}} {{his plans for}} the Western New Guinea campaign, <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would assume direct command of land forces when he reached the Philippines, and suggesting that Blamey could either go with him as an army commander, or remain in Australia as Commander in Chief.

Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias {{and several of}} Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus {{that he should not}} offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted a better bride for him.
