500|$|The {{existence}} {{of the doctrine of}} substantive legitimate expectation in Singapore public law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor. In his judgment written on behalf of the Court, Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated that the idea behind the doctrine is that certain [...] "expectations could, in suitable circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right". Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could <b>estop</b> the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of substantive legitimate expectation {{has not yet}} been explicitly acknowledged as part of Singapore law. In Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997), the Singapore Court of Appeal had to decide whether life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant imprisonment for 20 years, which was the prevailing understanding, or whether it meant imprisonment for the remaining period of the convicted person's natural life. The Court concluded that the latter interpretation was correct, but overruled the former interpretation prospectively such that it only took effect from the date of the judgment and did not apply to the appellant. One of the reasons the Court relied on for doing so was the administrative law {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation. It recognized that [...] "certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right". Since for many years life imprisonment had been reckoned as 20 years' incarceration, this had given rise to a legitimate expectation according to which individuals had arranged their affairs. Thus, the Court ought to give effect to the expectation by prospectively overruling the prior interpretation. Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could <b>estop</b> the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E

5000|$|Where a court {{finds that}} a party has done {{something}} warranting a form of estoppel, that party {{is said to be}} <b>estopped</b> from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is <b>estopped</b> from presenting the related defence, or the plaintiff is <b>estopped</b> from making the related argument against the defendant. Lord Coke stated, [...] "It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth." ...|$|R

2500|$|Estoppel could {{arise in}} a {{situation}} where a creditor informs a debtor that a debt is forgiven, but then later insists upon repayment. In a case such as this, the creditor may be estopped from relying on their legal right to repayment, as the creditor has represented that he no longer treats the debt as extant. A landlord may tell his tenant that he is not required to pay rent {{for a period of time}} ("you don't need to pay rent until the war is over"). [...] After the war is over, the landlord would be [...] "estopped" [...] from claiming rents during the war period. Estoppel is often important in insurance law, where some actions by the insurer or the agent <b>estop</b> the insurer from denying a claim.|$|E

6000|$|At seven {{the next}} morning he started in cheerfully to work. At nine, A. M., he had placed three large stones on the first course in position, an hour having been spent in looking for a pick and hammer, and in the {{incidental}} [...] "chaffing" [...] with Bridget. At ten o'clock I went to overlook his work; it was a rash action, as it caused him to respectfully doff his hat, discontinue his labors, and lean back against the fence in cheerful and easy conservation. [...] "Are you fond uv blackberries, Captain?" [...] I told him that the children were in the habit of getting them from the meadow beyond, hoping to <b>estop</b> the suggestion I knew was coming. [...] "Ah, but, Captain, it's meself that with wanderin' and havin' nothin' to pass me lips but the berries I'd pick from the hedges,--it's meself knows where to find thim. Sure, it's yer childer, and foine boys they are, Captain, that's besaching me to go wid 'em to the place, known'st only to meself." [...] It is unnecessary to say that he triumphed. After the manner of vagabonds of all degrees, he had enlisted the women and children on his side--and my friend, the Tramp, had his own way. He departed at eleven and returned at four, P. M., with a tin dinner-pail half filled. On interrogating the boys it appeared that they had had a [...] "bully time," [...] but on cross-examination it came out that THEY had picked the berries. From four to six, three more stones were laid, and the arduous labors of the day were over. As I stood looking at the first course of six stones, my friend, the Tramp, stretched his strong arms out to their fullest extent and said: [...] "Ay, but it's worruk that's good for me; give me worruk, and it's all I'll be askin' fur." ...|$|E
60|$|The fifth {{resolution}} {{recommends that}} a Whig candidate for Congress be run in every district, {{regardless of the}} chances of success. We are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot succeed, {{to be able to}} choose between opponents; but we believe that that gratification is the seed-time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness. By this policy we entangle ourselves. By voting for our opponents, such of us as do it in some measure <b>estop</b> ourselves to complain of their acts, however glaringly wrong we may believe them to be. By this policy no one portion of our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our political identity is partially frittered away and lost. And, again, those who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest persecutors. Take a few prominent examples. In 1830 Reynolds was elected Governor; in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect Judge Young to the United States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently elected him; in 1836 General Ewing, was so elected to the United States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our men and measures than they? During the last summer the whole State was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us, methodized into chapters and verses, written by two of these same men,--Reynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging us with error merely, but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of human liberty, itself. If it be the will of Heaven that such men shall politically live, be it so; but never, never again permit them to draw a particle of their sustenance from us.|$|E
