500|$|The current {{building}} has several atria: A Louis Comfort Tiffany, (1848-1933), (later Tiffany & Co. studios of New York City) mosaic vaulted ceiling dome caps a 5-story balconied atrium {{in the southwest}} corner; the northwest section has a 13-story skylit atrium, and a newer atrium with a fountain in the center is bridged by double escalator banks. The Tiffany Ceiling is over , {{and it is the}} first <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> dome and it continues to be the largest glass mosaic of its kind. Only Egypt's 3,000-year-old Temple of Karnak, with its [...] columns rivals the four [...] Ionic-style capped granite columns on the State Street façade. The building is estimated to be [...] high.|$|E
60|$|So {{he turned}} away to his coffee and eggs. A little silver egg-cup with a curious little frill round it: honey in a frail, <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> bowl, gold-iridescent: the charm of {{delicate}} and fine things. He smiled half mockingly to himself. Two instincts played in him: the one, an instinct for fine, delicate things: he had attractive hands; the other, an inclination to throw the dainty little table with all its niceties out of the window. It evoked a sort of devil in him.|$|E
50|$|Favrile {{glass is}} a type of <b>iridescent</b> art <b>glass</b> {{designed}} by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It was patented in 1894 and first produced in 1896. It differs from most <b>iridescent</b> <b>glasses</b> because the color is ingrained in the glass itself, as well as having distinctive coloring. Favrile glass was used in Tiffany's stained-glass windows.|$|R
5000|$|Favrile is {{different}} from other <b>iridescent</b> <b>glasses</b> because its color is {{not just on the}} surface, but embedded in the glass. The original trade name Fabrile was derived from an Old English word, fabrile, meaning [...] "hand-wrought" [...] or handcrafted. Tiffany later changed the word to Favrile [...] "since this sounded better".|$|R

60|$|The travel of {{the last}} few weeks had {{impressed}} Benham's imagination profoundly. For {{the first time in his}} life he had come face to face with civilization in defeat. From Venice hitherward he had marked with cumulative effect the clustering evidences of effort spent and power crumbled to nothingness. He had landed upon the marble quay of Pola and visited its deserted amphitheatre, he had seen a weak provincial life going about ignoble ends under the walls of the great Venetian fortress and the still more magnificent cathedral of Zara; he had visited Spalato, clustered in sweltering grime within the ample compass of the walls of Diocletian's villa, and a few troublesome sellers of coins and <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> and fragments of tessellated pavement and such-like loot was all the population he had found amidst the fallen walls and broken friezes and columns of Salona. Down this coast there ebbed and flowed a mean residual life, a life of violence and dishonesty, peddling trades, vendettas and war. For a while the unstable Austrian ruled this land and made a sort of order that the incalculable chances of international politics might at any time shatter. Benham was drawing near now to the utmost limit of that extended peace. Ahead beyond the mountain capes was Montenegro and, further, Albania and Macedonia, lands of lawlessness and confusion. Amanda and he had been warned of the impossibility of decent travel beyond Cattaro and Cettinje but this had but whetted her adventurousness and challenged his spirit. They were going to see Albania for themselves.|$|E
60|$|Of {{many other}} facts I {{was at the}} time vividly aware: of the charm of finding the {{archaeologist}} in an upper room of the mediaeval church which is turning itself into his study, of listening to his prefatory talk, so informal and so easy that one did not realize how learned it was, and then of following him down to the scene of his researches and hearing him speak wisely, poetically, humorously, even, of what he believed he had reason to expect to find. We stood with him by the Arch of Titus and saw how the sculptures had been broken from it in the fragments found at its base, and how the carved marbles had been burned for lime in the kiln built a few feet off, so that those who wanted the lime need not have the trouble of carrying the sculptures away before burning them. A handful of <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> from a house-drain near by, where it had been thrown by the servants after breaking it, testified of the continuity of human nature in the domestics of all ages. A somewhat bewildering suggestion of the depth at which the different periods of Rome underlie one another spoke {{from the mouth of the}} imperial well or cistern which had been sunk on the top of a republican well or cistern at another corner of the arch. In a place not far off, looking like a potter's clay pit, were graves so old that they seem to have antedated the skill of man to spell any record of himself; and in the small building which seems the provisional repository of the archaeologist's finds we saw skeletons of the immemorial dead in the coffins of split trees still shutting them imperfectly in. Mostly the bones and bark were of the same indifferent interest, but the eternal pathos of human grief appealed from what mortal part remained of a little child, with beads on her tattered tunic and an ivory bracelet on her withered arm. History in the presence of such world-old atomies seemed an infant babbling of yesterday, in what it could say of the Rome of the Popes, the Rome of the Emperors, the Rome of the Republicans, the Rome of the Kings, the Rome of the Shepherds and Cowherds, through which a shaft sunk in the Forum would successively pierce in reaching those aboriginals whose sepulchres alone witnessed that they had ever lived.|$|E

5000|$|Dugan is {{best known}} for peach opalescent, a type of Carnival glass. They {{produced}} the most peach opalescent of any of the carnival glass manufacturers. They also produced deep shades of amethyst glass, some so dark they appeared black. [...] They were also known for deep crimped edges. They also produced <b>Iridescent</b> Frit <b>Glass.</b> The Dugan Pompeian, Venetian, and Japanese glass lines were examples of frit glass. These pieces were rolled in glass frit, which is ground up pieces of glass, and then shaped by hand.|$|R
50|$|Steuben Glass Works started {{operation}} in October 1903. Carder produced blanks for Hawkes and also began producing cut glass himself. Carder's great love was colored glass {{and had been}} instrumental in the reintroduction of colored glass while at Stevens and Williams. When Steuben's success at producing blanks for Hawkes became assured, Carder began to experiment with colored glass and continued experiments that were started in England. He soon perfected Gold Aurene which was similar to <b>iridescent</b> art <b>glass</b> that was being produced by Tiffany and others. Gold Aurene {{was followed by a}} wide range of colored art glass that eventually was produced in more than 7,000 shapes and 140 colors.|$|R
50|$|As {{opposed to}} the classic rhinestones which had a metal powder coating on the bottom side only, several {{companies}} have opted to mass produce <b>iridescent</b> lead <b>glass,</b> by reducing the metal coating thickness and apply it uniformly, not using metal powder with a binder but by applying various forms of metal deposition (thin foil, vapor deposition, etc): Favrile glass by Tiffany in 1894, Carnival glass under the name 'Iridrill' by Fenton in 1908, 'Aurora Borealis' glass by Swarovski in 1955 and PVD-coated dichroic glass in the late 20th century, amongst many other decorative lead glasses coated with a thin metal layer sold under various commercial names such as 'rainbow glass', 'aurora glass' and such.|$|R
50|$|The keys to {{its appeal}} were {{that it looked}} superficially like the very much finer and very much more {{expensive}} blown <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> by Tiffany, Loetz and others and also that the cheerful bright finish caught the light even in dark corners of the home.|$|E

6000|$|I was {{watching}} a solitary spring, when, far across the fields, stood up a plume of spun <b>glass,</b> <b>iridescent</b> and superb, against the sky. [...] "That," [...] said the trooper, [...] "is Old Faithful. He goes off every sixty-five minutes to the minute, plays for five minutes, and sends up a column of water {{a hundred and fifty}} feet high. By the time you have looked at all the other geysers he will be ready to play." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{entrance}} of the theatre, there are mascarons in bronze with depictions of Tlaloc, and Chaac, the Aztec and Maya deities of water, which along with the rest were designed by Gianette Fiorenzo. On the arch over the stage there are representations of various mythological personas such as the Muses with Apollo. This was constructed in Hungary in the workshops of Géza Maróti. However, the most impacting aspect is the stage [...] "curtain" [...] which is a stained glass foldable panel created out of nearly a million [...] pieces of <b>iridescent</b> colored <b>glass</b> by Tiffany's in New York. This stage curtain {{is the only one of}} its type in any opera house in the world and weighs 24 tons. The design of the curtain has the volcanos Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl in the center. Around them is a Mexican landscape surrounded by images of sculptures from Yautepec and Oaxaca. This design was inspired by work done by artist Gerardo Murillo (Dr. Atl). The theatre has a capacity of 1,000.|$|R
30|$|The imprint process {{between the}} ZnO NR mold and the semi-dried TiO 2 film was {{performed}} using an embossing machine at 10  bar for 15  s. After detaching the mold, the well-aligned ZnO NRs were successfully transferred {{on top of}} the semi-dried TiO 2 film, and then the photoanode substrate was completely sintered at 450  °C for 30  min to remove the remaining organic binders. Figure  1 c represents the transferred ZnO NRs on the TiO 2 film. Highly ordered ZnO NRs are tilted and lean on each other, and the root part of the ZnO NRs is facing upward after transferring. A dye-adsorbed ZNL/TiO 2 photoanode is shown in the inset of Fig.  1 c, which was made in an area of 4  cm 2 on a FTO <b>glass.</b> <b>Iridescent</b> colors (red-green) appear because of light reflection at the periodic ZnO NR array surface, which demonstrates a faithful transfer of the ZNL uniformly over the entire area. Figure  1 d reveals an area where the ZnO NRs were not transferred onto the TiO 2 film defectively. Imprinted holes by the ZnO NRs appeared on the TiO 2 film, in which the ZnO NRs should be embedded if properly transferred. A holey TiO 2 film without the ZNL was also possible after removing the ZNL by chemical wet etching using a hydrochloric acid solution before dye adsorption, as shown in Fig.  1 e.|$|R
50|$|A set of {{concrete}} steps leads {{up to the}} main entrance, double wooden doors surrounded by an enframement in which pilasters on the side support a large pointed arch with <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> panels. Inside, a narrow vestibule, with a kitchen on the side, leads to another set of double doors which open onto the community room. It has a pass-through window to the kitchen on a rear wall that replicates the sanctuary's original rear wall.|$|E
5000|$|The Tiffany {{windows were}} {{designed}} by Frederick Wilson (1858-1932), Tiffany's chief designer for ecclesiastical windows. He made extensive use of Tiffany's special glassmaking technologies, including confetti glass, <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass,</b> 3D-textured [...] "drapery glass", pastel colors for [...] "painting in glass", and the trademark opalescent “Favrile” glass. There are {{as many as six}} or seven layers of glass in a Tiffany window, producing visual textures that would otherwise have to be painted in. Only some fine details impractical to produce in glass were hand-painted, in permanent enamel.|$|E

The Tiffany Ceiling is over 6000 sq ft, {{and it is the}} first <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> dome and it continues to be the largest glass mosaic of its kind. Only Egypt's 3,000-year-old Temple of Karnak, with its 70 ft columns rivals the four 50 ft Ionic-style capped granite columns on the State Street façade. The building is estimated to be 150.68 ft high.|$|E
60|$|From {{the classic}} sculpture, I passed through an Assyrian room, where {{the walls are}} lined with great slabs of marble {{sculptured}} in bas-relief with scenes {{in the life of}} Senmacherib, I believe; very ugly, to be sure, yet artistically done in their own style, and in wonderfully good preservation. Indeed, if the chisel had cut its last stroke in them yesterday, the work could not be more sharp and distinct. In glass cases, in this room, are little relics and scraps of utensils, {{and a great deal of}} fragmentary rubbish, dug up by Layard in his researches,-- things that it is hard to call anything but trash, but which yet may be of great significance as indicating the modes of life of a long-past race. I remember nothing particularly just now, except some pieces of broken <b>glass,</b> <b>iridescent</b> with certainly the most beautiful hues in the world,--indescribably beautiful, and unimaginably, unless one can conceive of the colors of the rainbow, and a thousand glorious sunsets, and the autumnal forest-leaves of America, all condensed upon a little fragment of a glass cup,--and that, too, without becoming in the least glaring or flagrant, but mildly glorious, as we may fancy the shifting lines of an angel's wing may be. I think this chaste splendor will glow in my memory for years to come. It is the effect of time, and cannot be imitated by any known process of art. I have seen it in specimens of old Roman glass, which has been famous here in England; but never in anything is there the brilliancy of these Oriental fragments. How strange that decay, in dark places, and underground, and where there are a billion chances to one that nobody will ever see its handiwork, should produce these beautiful effects! The glass seems to become perfectly brittle, so that it would vanish, like a soap-bubble, if touched.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the main}} entry, {{at the base}} of the clock tower, is the entry hall, known as the Compass Room. The name {{references}} the navigational star compass rose design laid out in hand-cut marble tiles on the floor at its center. The Compass Room has marble wainscotting, and is lighted by a multi-globe chandelier suspended above the compass rose from an elaborate plaster rosette. Triple-globe wall sconces around the perimeter illuminate a band of inlaid green <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> tile on the walls. Circular clerestory windows are trimmed in plaster relief decoration. This motif was originally repeated throughout most of the station's waiting room. While there is no known influence for the design of the interior, it resembles the ceiling of the famous Salone dei Cinquecento at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy featuring a similar coffered grid with dentils and repeating circles.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{retiring}} {{from his position}} {{as president of the}} First National Bank of Chicago in 1900, Nickerson sold the house to Lucius George Fisher, the president of Union Bag & Paper Co., who owned the house until his death in 1916. [...] After purchasing the house, Fisher hired the Prairie School architect George Washington Maher to redesign Nickerson's art gallery, making it into a trophy room and rare book library. Among other features, Maher had a stained glass dome built to replace the room's skylight. As part of the remodeling, new book cases and a monumental mantlepiece, attributed to Robert E. Seyfarth who was an architect in Maher's office at the time, were installed in the gallery. The <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass</b> tile fire surround of the mantle was created by the Chicago firm of Giannini & Hilgart.|$|E
5000|$|The Darwin D. Martin House was {{designed}} by Frank Lloyd Wright and built between 1903 and 1905 for Darwin D. Martin, an executive of the Larkin Soap Company. Martin chose Wright to design his own house {{because he was so}} impressed with Wright and his design for the Larkin Administration Building. [...] The Martin House is considered {{to be one of the}} most important projects from Wright's Prairie School era. Compared to other Prairie Houses, the Martin House is unusually large and has an open plan containing fifteen distinctive patterns of nearly 400 art glass windows, designed by Wright, some of which contain over 750 individual pieces of <b>iridescent</b> <b>glass,</b> that act as light screens to connect exterior views to the spaces within. More patterns of art glass were designed for the house than for any other of Wright's Prairie Houses. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 24, 1986 and designated a National Historic Landmark, also on February 24, 1986.|$|E
40|$|Frankish Excavations at Bulles (Oise - France) Since 1963, {{a medical}} {{practitioner}} has been digging {{on the site}} of a large Frankish burial ground.
