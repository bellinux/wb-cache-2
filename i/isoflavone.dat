Results: <b>Isoflavones</b> do not {{play an important role}} on prostate-specific antigen levels reduction in PCa patients or healthy men.

A particularly intriguing hypothesis is that soy intake early in life markedly reduces breast cancer risk in adulthood. 2, 3 <b>Isoflavones</b> {{are considered to be}} phytoestrogens and exert both antiestrogenic and estrogen-like effects under some experimental conditions. 4 However, the effects of <b>isoflavones</b> on breast tissue in adult women are not clearly understood.
