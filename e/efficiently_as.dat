5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire <b>efficiently.</b> <b>As</b> a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E

5|$|The brigade's Headquarters Company {{managed the}} {{engineer}} battalions {{but it also}} undertook its own missions, including humanitarian missions and public affairs assignments. It {{was supported by the}} brigade's Special Troops Battalion which provided a wide range of duties for the Headquarters. The task of detecting and removing IEDs proved particularly difficult for the brigade, as IEDs were a serious issue for coalition forces and the leading cause of casualties at the time. The 54th Engineer Battalion under the 130th was specially tasked with counter-IED operations on the over 300kilometers of roads that the brigade was responsible for. The 249th Engineer Battalion was charged with maintaining the power grid throughout Iraq. They were required to assess 200 power stations throughout the country and make repairs to each one individually. The 84th Engineer Battalion was tasked with most construction projects in the Forward Operating Bases. These projects involved expansion of many of the larger FOBs as smaller ones were shut down and consolidated. One of the main focuses of the Battalion was the expansion of living quarters at Al Asad Air Base. The 565th Engineer Battalion was responsible for maintaining the supply yards housing building materials {{for the rest of the}} Brigade's battalions, and to ensure that the materials were dispersed and used as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> possible. The brigade's mechanical and vehicle maintenance duties were provided by civilian contractors. These contractors also handled transportation of construction vehicles and vehicle parts to the theater.|$|E

This gives language implementers immense freedom to schedule operations as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> possible.

25|$|Fish {{are able}} to quickly metabolize and {{eliminate}} PAHs, therefore tissue residue of parent PAH compounds will not provide adequate information on exposure to the organism. PAH exposure in fish {{has been associated with}} reproductive impairment, immune deficiency, and liver lesions as well as other health problems. In contrast, invertebrates do not metabolize and excrete PAHs as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> fish, therefore an investigator can better understand location and temporal patterns of bioavailable PAHs through tissue residue of these invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Some {{assemblers}} {{may also}} be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|Charge-sustaining mode {{is used by}} {{production}} hybrid vehicles (HEVs) today, and {{combines the}} operation of the vehicle's two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band. Over the course of a trip in a HEV the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change. The battery in a HEV can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device. Once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode, it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically.|$|E

25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that as we age our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for our inability to use working memory <b>efficiently</b> <b>as</b> we age. The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E
