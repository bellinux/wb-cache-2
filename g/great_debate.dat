40|$|The {{field of}} {{international}} relations {{has a long tradition}} of <b>Great</b> <b>Debates,</b> but both grand theory and clashes between competing grand theories now appear to be on the wane. Many international relationists bemoan the dominance of “normal science, ” a phrase almost always uttered in a derogatory manner. Yet, if grand theory was king, it was an evil tyrant. The <b>Great</b> <b>Debates</b> did help clarify issues in the field and were not entirely useless, though this is a low hurdle to cross. 1 Despite the attention they received, however, nothing was ever resolved. Indeed, as I shall explain, each of the three <b>Great</b> <b>Debates</b> continues to this day. More insidiously, the first and third <b>Great</b> <b>Debates</b> took the form of “paradigm wars ” in which the focus was less on how to explain world politics and more on which set of assumptions best captured the inherent nature of humans as political animals or states as political organizations. The paradigm wars greatly perverted the discipline and turned inquiry into contests of a quasi-religious belief in the power of one or another “ism ” (Lake 2011). I for one, do not mourn the tyrant’s passing. Developing in the interstices of the <b>Great</b> <b>Debates,</b> however, has always been a strain of mid-level theory that, today, forms the basis for a more eclectic approach t...|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} a matter for <b>great</b> <b>debate</b> in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.|$|E
5|$|William of Poitiers {{describes}} a council called by Duke William, {{in which the}} writer gives an account of a <b>great</b> <b>debate</b> that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, {{it is unlikely that}} any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife {{for the duration of the}} invasion.|$|E
