500|$|Also {{published}} in 1961 was Vonnegut's short story, [...] "Harrison Bergeron", {{set in a}} dystopic future where all are equal, {{even if that means}} disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages.

[...] He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers. Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that [...] "Harrison Bergeron" [...] might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high school misfit. [...] In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows [...] "in any leveling process, what really is lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom". Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on [...] "Harrison Bergeron", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.|$|E

Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?"

[...] One juror stated, [...] "His presentation indicated that he was well able to develop his own songs." ...|$|E

He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his Christmas Carols New and Old (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. H. R.
