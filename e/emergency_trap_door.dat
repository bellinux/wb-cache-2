50|$|The {{addition}} of glycerol {{results in an}} exothermic reaction (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive oxidation of organic materials by the hot nitric acid {{and the release of}} poisonous nitrogen dioxide gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the glycerin mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the glycerin addition at about 22 C, much below which the esterification occurs too slowly to be useful. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of iron or lead and generally stirred with compressed air, has an <b>emergency</b> <b>trap</b> <b>door</b> at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about 30 C (actual value varying by country) or brown fumes are seen in the nitrator's vent, then it is immediately drowned.|$|E

50|$|Vans {{built over}} the 1888-1925 period were {{constructed}} with a single <b>trap</b> <b>door</b> installed in place of louvres {{at one end of}} the wagon, while later wagons were fitted with a <b>trap</b> <b>door</b> at each end. The <b>trap</b> <b>doors</b> were used for the insertion of long metal bars, which could be used for hanging meat. When wagons were going through regular maintenance in the 1960s' the <b>trap</b> <b>doors</b> were either welded shut or the entire end panel was replaced with a new section of only louvres.|$|R
