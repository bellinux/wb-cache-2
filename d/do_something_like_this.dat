Two days later, {{he wrote in a}} press release announcing The Eraser: [...] "I have been itching to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> for ages. It was fun and quick to do ... Yes, it's a record! No, it's not a Radiohead record." [...] He emphasised that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made [...] "with their blessing". Before the album's release, [...] "Black Swan" [...] was used in the closing credits of the film A Scanner Darkly.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back raises his hand and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> But {{how often do you}} get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
500|$|... "Together Again" [...] {{was written}} {{as a tribute}} from Jackson to {{a friend who had}} {{recently}} died from AIDS as well as AIDS victims and their families worldwide, as stated in the liner notes of The Velvet Rope (1997). Originally written as a ballad, the track was re-arranged as a dance and house song. Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song from her own personal experience, as well as a piece of fan-mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father. According to Jimmy Jam, [...] "it had a deep meaning for her because it was about a friend she lost to AIDS, but as with all her songs, she tries to make them apply in a general sense to anybody. The idea was to make it a joyous song musically". The arrangement of the song was constructed in 30 minutes by Jam, Lewis, and Jackson while in the recording studio. Once the melody was in place, Jackson finished writing the lyrics to the song. The song's sound was inspired by Donna Summer's song [...] "Last Dance". Jackson told MTV News that her inspiration to write [...] "Together Again" [...] was [...] "Runaway" [...] by Nuyorican Soul, as the song reminded her of being in Studio 54 in New York when she was a child. [...] "Runaway" [...] gave Jackson a kind of New York feel of disco and she wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a guy who would <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E

[...] On August 24, 2007, his 42nd birthday, Miller decided against any comeback, stating: [...] "Physically, I know I could have done it.

2500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{prolonged}} touring of fourth album Catalyst (2004), {{which included a}} supporting slot on Green Day's American Idiot Tour, the band were left drained and sought an extended break. They {{were able to take}} two months off and regroup afterward, something they had not previously done during their career. The quintet decided to take on a new approach for the writing process of Coming Home, rather than the usual [...] "tour bus and dressing room jams", they moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and demo new material. Despite this, main composer and lead guitarist, Chad Gilbert took a book containing over 40 riff ideas that he had written during the previous tour into the mansion. Drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained that, [...] "The whole idea is that we can be sitting around, watching TV, and suddenly be like, 'Hey, I've got an idea. Let's do this'. We've always wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> but we were never sure just how to do it. I know all the guys are really excited to get into the house, hang out and make some music." [...] The band spent four months in Malibu with studio engineer and long term friend Paul Miner, from August 2005 through November, eventually leaving with 14 finished demos to present to their record label.|$|E
6000|$|Around {{this terrible}} spot the Franciscans have done {{something}} which will strike many good and thoughtful people as quite fantastically inadequate; and which strikes me as fantastically but precisely right. They have laid out the garden simply as a garden, {{in a way that}} is completely natural because it is completely artificial. They have made flower-beds in the shape of stars and moons, and coloured them with flowers like those in the backyard of a cottage. The combination of these bright patterns in the sunshine with the awful shadow in the centre is certainly an incongruity in the sense of a contrast. But it is a poetical contrast, like that of birds building in a temple or flowers growing on a tomb. The best way of suggesting what I for one feel about it would be something like this; suppose we imagine a company of children, such as those whom Christ blessed in Jerusalem, afterwards put permanently in charge of a field full of his sorrow; it is probable that, if they could do anything with it, they would <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> They might cut it up into quaint shapes and dot it with red daisies or yellow marigolds. I really do not know that there is anything better that grown up people could do, since anything that the greatest of them could do must be, must look quite as small. [...] "Shall I, the gnat that dances in Thy ray, dare to be reverent?" [...] The Franciscans have not dared to be reverent; they have only dared to be cheerful. It may be too awful an adventure of the imagination to imagine Christ in that garden. But there is not the smallest difficulty about imagining St. Francis there; and that is something to say of an institution which is eight hundred years old.|$|E
