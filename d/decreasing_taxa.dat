40|$|Drought {{and drying}} of {{perennial}} streams plays {{a central role}} in determining the structure of in-stream communities, <b>decreasing</b> <b>taxa</b> richness and abundance and changing trophic organisation. Further, flow cessation can increase spatial b-diversity of macroinvertebrate communities across disconnected sites. It has been hypothesised that the hyporheic zone may act as a refugium for benthic macroinvertebrates during low flow and flow cessation, but evidence remains equivocal. We explored hyporheic and surface benthic macroinvertebrate community changes associated with low flow and flow cessation conditions during a supra-seasonal drought on two normally perennial rivers: the Cotter and Queanbeyan Rivers (Canberra, ACT). Surface benthic and hyporheic samples were collected from these two rivers and four associated tributary streams across a drying gradient during dry conditions and after flow recovery to test whether macroinvertebrates in perennial streams utilise the hyporheic zone as a refugium and whether there is greater variability in the macroinvertebrate community at sites experiencing flow cessation compared with wetter sites. Low flow had no impact on macroinvertebrate taxa richness or density in either surface benthic or hyporheic habitats, whereas density and taxa richness declined during streambed drying, suggesting that the hyporheic zone did not provide a refugium for some taxa during these dry conditions. Spatial b-diversity peaked at dry sites, likely in response to the broad range of environmental conditions that may differ between refuges and sites, but decreased after flow recovery. Refuges in perennial streams appear more vulnerable to human disturbances during dry periods because a loss of suitable refuges can affect the ability of some macroinvertebrate taxa to recolonise after flow recovery.

40|$|Extreme climatic {{events such}} as {{droughts}} are known to eliminate aquatic biota and alter community structure and function. Perennial headwater springs provide important drought refugia to benthic macroinvertebrates and {{an important source of}} colonists via drift or aerial adults to intermittent streams post-drought. During a supra-seasonal drought in North-central Texas summer and fall 2006, benthic macroinvertebrates from persistent groundwater-dependent macrohabitats of varying hydrological connectivity and riparian shading were studied: perennial riffles, connected pools, shaded disconnected pools, and full sun disconnected pools. Riffles were a distinct habitat with significantly higher taxa richness, proportion of lotic taxa, diversity and evenness than other macrohabitats. Macrohabitats were found to be important refugia for 106 benthic macroinvertebrates and 4 microcrustacean taxa. Throughout the extreme drought, perennially flowing habitats were refugia to 19 taxa (17. 9 % total taxa) not collected in disconnected pools. Shaded disconnected pools contained lotic taxa not previously known to be able to complete their lifecycles in lentic habitats, emphasizing the importance of groundwater effluent and shading. With the resumption of flow at a downstream intermittent site of Ash Creek in mid-October 2006, an annual recolonization study was conducted comparing the perennial headwaters’ benthic macroinvertebrate taxa richness, densities and community ecology with the downstream intermittent site. The headwaters supported higher mean taxa richness than the intermittent site over the duration of the study (ANOVA P < 0. 001). However, the unexpected result of overall <b>decreasing</b> <b>taxa</b> richness at the perennial headwater site from August 2006 to April 2008 appears to reflect lag effects of the supra-seasonal drought combined with effects of multiple spates of 2007, which are factors confounding the point of recovery for taxa richness. Recovery of taxa richness at the intermittent site took 9 months compared to 1 to 2 months reported in other arid and semi-arid streams in the United States recovering from seasonal drying and floods. Sustainable use of groundwater resources and conservation of riparian corridors is vital to protecting groundwater-dependent ecosystems that {{play a vital role in}} maintaining regional biodiversity by serving as biotic refugia during catastrophic disturbance...|$|E

There are relatively few long-term studies investigating the ability of stream ecosystems to recover from AMD. Here we assess watershed scale recovery of a cold-water stream from pollution by AMD using a 1967 survey of the biological and chemical properties of the stream as a pre-restoration benchmark. We sampled water chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish throughout the watershed during {{the spring and summer of}} 2011. Water chemistry results indicated that pH and total alkalinity increased post-restoration, while acidity, sulfate, and iron concentrations <b>decreased.</b> Watershed-level <b>taxa</b> richness, local taxa richness, biomass, diversity, and density of macroinvertebrates were significantly higher post-restoration; however, %EPT was not significantly different.

An analysis of time-series of {{the abundance of}} 54 phytoplankton taxa in Galicia (NW Spain) between 1989 and 2008 to determine {{the main trends in}} relation to climate and upwelling showed that most of their variability was stochastic, as seasonality and long term trends accounted for a minor fraction of the series. All trends were non linear, and taxa clustered in 4 groups according to the trend pattern but there was no defined pattern for diatoms, dinoflagellates or flagellates. No clear trend was shown by 23 <b>taxa,</b> 14 <b>taxa</b> <b>decreased</b> and 4 <b>taxa</b> increased during the early 1990 s, while only 13 taxa showed a general increase through the series. In contrast, series of local environmental conditions (temperature, stratification, nutrients) and climate-related variables (atmospheric pressure indices, upwelling winds) showed a high fraction of their variability in deterministic seasonality and trends. As a result, each taxa showed independent responses to environmental and climate variablity, measured by generalized additive models. Most taxa showed a positive relationship with nutrient concentrations but only a few showed a direct relationship with stratification and upwelling. Climate variables only had measurable effects on some taxa but no common response emerged. Because its adaptation to frequent disturbances, phytoplankton communities in upwelling ecosystems appear less sensitive to changes in regional climate than communities characterised by short and well defined productive periods.

40|$|Lake Garda {{is one of}} {{the four}} large Central European lakes {{included}} in the EuLakes Project (Reg. Nr. 2 CE 243 P 3). The main objectives are to evaluate the lake vulnerability against specific human stressors in a climate change scenario, and to promote sustainable lake management. Lake Garda is the largest lake in Italy. The deep basin (350 m) is little impacted by human activities and is suitable for reconstruction of long-term environmental variability. In contrast, the shallow basin (81 m) is strongly affected by human activities and is for this reason more suitable for studying lake eutrophication. A consistent monitoring program was started in the early 1990 s. Before that, only sporadic limnological measurements are available. Lake sediment records provide a complementary source of information to extend the time span of ecological records back into the past, through the reconstruction of secular lake evolution. Radiometrical dating, geochemical (water and LOI content) and biological proxies (algal pigments and diatoms) are being analysed in one short core (56 cm) retrieved from the deepest part of the lake. Initial analyses of the sub-fossil diatom assemblages during the 20 th century show two major changes. The first one, recorded around 1960, is an increase in the relative abundance of planktonic Fragilariaceae, whereas centric <b>taxa</b> <b>decrease</b> suggesting a nutrient enrichment. The second change, in mid 1940 s, consists of a <b>decrease</b> in benthic <b>taxa,</b> which may be related with the intensive hydroelectrical exploitation of the catchment area.

40|$|Large inserts of {{horizontally}} acquired DNA {{that contain}} functionally related genes with limited phylogenetic distribution are {{often referred to}} as genomic islands (GIs), and structural definitions of these islands, based on common features, have been proposed. Although a large number of mobile elements fall well within the GI definition, there are several concerns about the structural consensus for GIs: The current GI definition was put forward 10 yr ago when only 12 complete bacterial genomes were available, a large number of GIs deviate from that definition, and in silico predictions assuming a full/partial GI structural model bias the sampling of the GI structural space toward “well-structured” GIs. In this study, the structural features of genomic regions are sampled by a hypothesis-free, bottom-up search, and these are exploited in a machine learning approach with the aim of explicitly quantifying and modeling the contribution of each feature to the GI structure. Performing a whole-genome-based comparative analysis between 37 strains of three different genera and 12 outgroup genomes, 668 genomic regions were sampled and used to train structural GI models. The data show that, overall, GIs from the three different genera fall into distinct, genus-specific structural families. However, <b>decreasing</b> the <b>taxa</b> resolution, by studying GI structures across different genus boundaries, provides models that converge on a fairly similar GI structure, further suggesting that GIs {{can be seen as a}} superfamily of mobile elements, with core and variable structural features, rather than a well-defined family...|$|R

Farther away, faunal density <b>decreases</b> and equilibrium <b>taxa</b> gradually replace opportunistic species. No more environmental impact is perceptible beyond 3 km. Nevertheless, some differences exist: foraminifera appear to be more impacted at the disposal site, probably {{as a consequence of the}} low pH, a supplementary stress factor for organisms provided with a calcareous test. At 3 km west of the disposal site, macrofauna is comparable to the reference station, whereas foraminifera still indicate environmental degradation, suggesting their higher sensitivity to this type of pollution.

The use of pollen and carbonized panicle analyses from sediment cores, in conjunction with ecological research on plant-fire relationships, establishes a role for palaeoecological techniques in the interpretation of long-term processes in semi-arid heathlands in Australia. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the treeless structure at our study site in the Little Desert of western Victoria has existed since at least the early Holocene.

To evaluate the effects of municipal wastewater effluent (WWE) and Missouri River water (MOR) as irrigation sources on soil chemistry, seed banks, and microorganisms, a field study was conducted in conjunction with a set of greenhouse studies and microbial assays. Samples of soils from WWE-irrigated and MOR-irrigated impoundments at Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area indicated that soil electrical conductivity was significantly greater and pH significantly less in WWE-impoundments. Results of greenhouse studies show that irrigation with WWE <b>decreased</b> vegetative <b>taxa</b> richness, stem densities, and biomass relative to other irrigation sources. Increases in electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium resulted from irrigation with WWE, which altered edaphic conditions and inhibited germination of the seed banks. Additionally, microbial activity was decreased in soil materials irrigated with WWE although microbial abundance was similar among treatments. Increased salinity and sodicity in the soil materials irrigated with WWE were concluded to be responsible for the depressed soil microbial activity. Wastewater irrigated wetlands may develop elevated levels of salinity and sodicity that alters edaphic conditions and ecological processes. This may be particularly pertinent to wetland managers that employ moist-soil practices to stimulate germination of selective taxa from freshwater seed banks...|$|R

In February 1981 a core {{was taken from}} the profundal sediments of the lake and analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} salt perturbation on the diatom community over a 32 -year period. Diatom assemblages from different levels were compared using multivariate techniques including cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Shifts in diatom composition related to salinification were revealed most clearly by subdominant taxa. Five distinct groups of diatom taxa were found to correspond with 5 depth intervals. The diatom component of the lake up to 1960 included two groups of taxa which were alkaliphilous and chloride indifferent. A reduction in species diversity beginning in 1960 may indicate a salt effect.

It was striking that many species which were abundant in the Caspian Sea in 1996 - 1997 were not found after 2000.

40|$|International audienceAquatic species {{living in}} running waters are widely {{acknowledged}} {{to be vulnerable}} to climate-induced, thermal and hydrological fluctuations. Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions {{are most likely to}} occur in a multiple-stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30 years (19792008) in the Middle Loire River, France. As observed in other large European rivers, water warming over the three decades (+ 0. 9 degrees C between 19791988 and 19992008) {{and to a lesser extent}} discharge reduction (80 m 3 s 1) were significantly involved in the disappearance or <b>decrease</b> in <b>taxa</b> typical from fast running, cold waters (e. g.

They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e. g. Corbicula sp. and Atyaephyra desmarestii). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i. e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution-sensitive taxa (e. g. the caddisfly Brachycentridae and Philopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects...|$|R
40|$|The Carex flava complex (Cyperaceae) {{was used}} as a model system in a study of the effects of {{variation}} in species delimitation on genetic diversity estimates. The whole complex constitutes a syngameon within which gene flow may occur between taxa. Several more or less distinct evolutionary lineages in the complex are morphologically similar to each other and are often combined into broadly defined taxonomic species. Separate calculations of genetic diversity estimates for the most narrowly defined species revealed clear differences between some of the taxa; for instance, C. flava s. s. had a very low value for individual gene diversity, H- 1 whereas C. hostiana and C. lepidocarpa ssp. lepidocarpa had high values for total genetic diversity, H-T Amounts of genetic diversity at different hierarchic levels (H-T, H-S, H-I) generally increased as narrowly defined species were combined into more broadly defined species. However, combining ecological species (ecotypes) within C. oederi s. l. had little effect on estimates of genetic diversity. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between populations, G(ST), increased initially as ecologically and/ or geographically separated lineages were amalgamated, but decreased as the species were even more boradly circumscribed to include distinct lineages growing in mixed populations. The proportion of genetic diversity due to variation between individuals within populations (numerically equivalent to the inbreeding coefficient, F-IS) was dependent on the degree of hybridization and introgression at sites with mixed populations and was found to increase or <b>decrease</b> when <b>taxa</b> became more broadly circumscribed. It is concluded that differences in species circumscription may have dramatic effects on genetic diversity estimates, and it is recommended that calculations should be performed separately for separate evolutionary lineages in order to obtain comparable estimates for different plant groups...|$|R
30|$|It {{was beyond}} the scope of this study to discuss the {{stressor}} response of every single OTU. It would also not have been possible, because only few OTUs can be reliably assigned to species and partly because there is a lack of ecological information. However, it is very likely that the applied stressors had an indirect effect on most chironomid OTUs rather than a direct physiological effect. The results of Beermann et al. [5] showed that many Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera <b>taxa</b> <b>decrease</b> in abundance upon added fine sediment and reduced flow velocity. Since many chironomids have a higher tolerance for more extreme conditions and the competition decreases with the applied stressors, they are likely increasing in abundance. A further indirect ecological effect might be due to the experimental manipulation affecting the microbial community. Microbes, i.e., bacteria and fungi, are the nutritional basis for many invertebrates either directly as food or indirectly as many invertebrates rely on microbial processes like decomposition of leaf litter. This highlights the need to extend multiple stressor analyses as done here to microbial taxa to understand community responses to multiple stressors and identify the relevance of indirect ecological effects.|$|R

We here evaluated the impact of oral consumption of a monostrain or multi-strain probiotic preparation in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. We observed a strain-specific effect and reported dissociation between the capacity of probiotics to dampen adipose tissue inflammation and to limit body weight gain. A multi-strain mixture was able to improve adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia through adipose tissue immune cell-remodelling, mainly affecting macrophages. At the gut level, the mixture modified the uptake of fatty acids and restored the expression level of the short-chain fatty acid receptor GPR 43. These beneficial effects were associated with changes in the microbiota composition, such as the restoration of the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Rikenellaceae and the <b>decrease</b> of other <b>taxa</b> like Lactobacillaceae. Using an in vitro gut model, we further showed that the probiotic mixture favours the production of butyrate and propionate.

The {{aim was to}} understand how eutrophication and climate change have influenced taxa co-occurrence patterns within and between groups over the lake water column (14 depths, 0 – 135 m), using null-models to test for non-random spatial (depth) assembly. We found that the whole community showed high taxa co-occurrence levels, significantly deviating over time from random assembly concurrently with lake warming and reduced nutrient loading. This pattern was driven mostly by the depth structure of metalimnetic assemblages during summer and autumn. The prevalence of non-random spatial patterns changed for different taxonomic and functional groups, with only few significant deviations from null-model expectations. Within taxonomic and functional groups (particularly Classes and size categories), the frequency of spatial overdispersion of <b>taxa</b> <b>decreased</b> over time while the frequency of clustering increased. Our {{data suggest that the}} relative importance of mechanisms determining phytoplankton metacommunity dynamics have changed along with environmental gradients shaping water column structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} the genus Picea form a {{dominant}} component in many alpine and boreal forests which are the major sink for atmospheric CO 2. However, {{little is known about}} the growth response and acclimation of CO 2 exchange characteristics to high temperature stress in Picea taxa from different altitudes. Gas exchange parameters and growth charac-teristics were recorded from four year old seedlings of two alpine (Picea likiangensis vars. rubescens and linzhiensis) and two lowland (P. koraiensis and P. meyeri) taxa. Seedlings were grown at moderate (25 °C/ 15 °C) and high (35 °C/ 25 °C) day/night temperatures, for four months. The approximated biomass increment (ΔD 2 H) for all <b>taxa</b> <b>decreased</b> under high temperature stress, associated with decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration. However, the two alpine taxa exhibited lower photosynthetic acclimation and higher respira-tory acclimation than either lowland taxon. Moreover, higher leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content per unit area (Narea), and a smaller change in the nitrogen use efficiency of photosynthesis (PNUE) for lowland taxa indicated that these maintained higher homeostasis of photosynthesis than alpine taxa. The higher respiration rates pro...|$|R
40|$|Summary- Sperm length was {{measured}} in 27 drosophilid species, and a general survey of size variation is presented for 75 species for which information is available. Mean length varies from 0. 113 mm in the D. obscura group to almost 20 mm in the recently investigated D. littoralis; in the latter case, sperm length is nearly 6 times the male body length. The huge interspecific variability may be estimated by considering the coefficient of variation (c. v.) between species belonging to the same taxon. In the genus Drosophila the c. v. amounts to 130 % (64 species). The average c. v. <b>decreases</b> in lower <b>taxa,</b> being for example 96 % in subgenera and 61 % in species groups. More closely related species are thus less divergent, {{but in any case}} sperm length must be considered as a fast evolving trait, increasing or decreasing. Individual measurements of sperm length within a species generally provide a unimonal, relatively gaussian distribution (monomorphism). By contrast, 13 investigated species of the D. obscura group exhibited bimodal distributions. This heteromorphism may be considered as a stable evolutionary strategy in the D. obscura group.

40|$|Samples of plankton, surface sediments and Holocene {{deposits}} {{from the}} South Alligator River, an energetic macrotidal river in northern Australia, are examined {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of estuarine foraminifers for palaeoenvironmental interpretation of sediments deposited in tropical macrotidal conditions. Although marine and estuarine foraminifers in the estuarine channel are mixed by strong tidal currents, there are significant trends along the 80 -km length of the tidal river. The relative proportions of marine and porcellaneous <b>taxa</b> <b>decrease</b> upstream from the mouth, but hyaline taxa and those with brackish affinities increase upstream. Foraminifers in intertidal sediments have distinctly different assemblages in the uppermost intertidal, mid-tidal (mangrove), lower intertidal and subtidal zones. In addition {{to the effects of}} tidal mixing, preserved thanatacoenoses are affected by selective dissolution and/or pyritisation within the sediment bodies. Despite the effects of adverse taphonomic factors, foraminiferal assemblages preserved in drill cores provide an accurate guide to original depositional environments (intertidal/subtidal; brackish estuarine/coastal marine), in mid-Holocene sediments in the South Alligator area. Foraminifers are found to improve the precision of previous palaeoenvironmental reconstructions {{made on the basis of}} sedimentary facies and pollen analyses. r 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|Alluvial springs are an {{interesting}} feature of braided river flood plains. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify and characterise the fauna and physicochemistry of these springs. The distribution and occurrence of springs was assessed using a GIS analysis in 20 South Island braided rivers. The greatest number of springs was found in east coast inter-montane valleys, 65 % of which were associated with obstructions in the river valley, such as alluvial fans, bluffs or flood retention works. A comparison between springs, hill slope streams and main channels in the upper Waimakariri River revealed physically disparate environments, which were reflected by their invertebrate communities. Springs contained the greatest number of unique taxa, which was attributed to high stability and the presence of phreatic taxa. In spring-sources the presence of aquatic plants were found to be a powerful structuring influence on benthic invertebrate communities. The generalist, asynchronous nature of New Zealand benthic invertebrate fauna, and the high diversity and evenness of predatory taxa are also thought to be influential on the high levels of taxonomic richness at spring-sources. Away from the spring-source taxonomic richness decreased due to the decline in stability and habitat complexity. Spring age, or time since major disturbance, was important in structuring benthic invertebrate communities. Older springs were dominated by non-insect taxa, whereas younger springs, were dominated by insects which are rapid dispersers. A macrophyte manipulation experiment was conducted in four spring-sources. The removal of macrophytes from treatment plots resulted in a <b>decrease</b> in <b>taxa</b> abundance, but an increase in evenness. Mayflies and caddisflies increased, replacing mollusca and diptera. This shift in community composition may have been due to changes in available living space, food resources, flow characteristics and physical structure between the cobble and macrophyte habitats. Springs contributed a major proportion of the benthic invertebrate biodiversity to the upper Waimakariri River and this study confirms that they deserve commensurate consideration in regional river management planning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Software {{interfaces}} for interactive multiple-entry taxonomic identification (polyclaves) sometimes {{provide a}} “best character ” or “separation ” coefficient, {{to guide the}} user to choose a character that could most effectively {{reduce the number of}} identification steps required.

Several current systems also provide tools to develop taxonomies or single-entry identification keys, with a variety of coefficients that are appropriate to that purpose. For the identification task, however, information theory neatly applies, and provides the most appropriate coefficient. To our knowledge, Delta-Intkey is the only currently available system that uses a coefficient related to information theory, and it is currently being reimplemented, which may allow for improvement. We describe two improvements to the algorithm used by Delta-Intkey. The first improves transparency as the number of remaining <b>taxa</b> <b>decreases,</b> by normalizing the range of the coefficient to [0, 1]. The second concerns numeric ranges, which require consistent treatment of sub-intervals and their end-points.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} the {{parasiticide}} ivermectin were assessed in plankton-dominated indoor microcosms. Ivermectin was applied once at concentrations of 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, and 10, 000 ng/l. The half-life (dissipation time 50 %; DT 50) of ivermectin in the water phase ranged from 1. 1 to 8. 3 days. The lowest NOECcommunity that could be derived on an isolated sampling from the microcosm study by means of multivariate techniques was 100 ng/l. The most sensitive species in the microcosm study were the cladocerans Ceriodaphnia sp. (no observed effect concentration, NOEC = 30 ng/l) and Chydorus sphaericus (NOEC = 100 ng/l). The amphipod Gammarus pulex was less sensitive to ivermectin, showing consistent statistically significant reductions at the 1000 -ng/l treatment level. Copepoda <b>taxa</b> <b>decreased</b> directly after application of ivermectin in the highest treatment but had already recovered at day 20 posttreatment. Indirect effects (e. g., increase of rotifers, increased primary production) were observed at the highest treatment level starting only on day 13 of the exposure phase. Cladocera showed the highest sensitivity to ivermectin in both standard laboratory toxicity tests {{as well as in}} the microcosm study.

40|$|Decreased {{consumption}} of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, {{has been proposed}} to promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an etiologic role. However, {{it is not known}} if transient fiber consumption during critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation. The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group. We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal microbiome. Several bacterial <b>taxa</b> <b>decreased</b> in relative abundance (e. g., Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0. 001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e. g., Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0. 008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0. 048]). Some of these shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowe...|$|R
