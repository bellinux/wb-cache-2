40|$|The {{objective}} of my {{study was to}} analyse the factors negatively influencing a somatic cell count (SCC) in raw cow´s milk. Milk samples were tested in three breeds with different technology of breeding and milking for a time period of three years. The SCC values were determined by <b>Fluoro-opto-electronic</b> <b>method</b> on a Fossomatic apparatus. Significant factor influencing SCC was quality practise hygiene of mammary gland. The lowest average values of SCC were determined in breed where was practise thoroughly hygiene of mammary gland (avarage SCC in year 2006 was 223, 3. 103 SB. ml- 1). Next factors negatively influencing SCC were age of cows, annual period, quality of feed and frequency exchanges a udder sleeve.

40|$|Physical-chemical {{composition}} and hygienic quality of milk are of crucial importance in cheese manufacturing. During 2007, a research {{was carried out}} with the aim to investigate manufacturing features and milk quality of Krk sheep and to describe technological procedure of manufacture and physicalchemical composition of Krk cheese. The milking capacity was checked according to AT method. Chemical composition was analyzed by infrared spectrometry and hygienic milk quality by <b>fluoro-opto-electronic</b> <b>method,</b> i. e. flow cytometry method. In 160 days of lactation, sheep produced in average 108 kg of milk (38 kg in lactating and 70 kg in milking period), 5. 67 kg of milk fat and 4. 12 kg of proteins. In the average, the milk contained: 19. 49 % of dry matter, 8. 29 % of milk fat, 5. 99 % of proteins, 4. 45 % of lactose and 11. 32 % of dry matter without fat. Milking had a significant influence on: daily milk quantity, dry matter and milk fat share, milk freezing point and hygienic milk quality (log 10 MO and log 10 BSS). Significant correlation coefficients were determined between manufacturing features of sheep and certain milk quality indicators. Based on the research results, values of physical-chemical composition, microbiological and sensory milk and cheese quality can be suggested, necessary in standardization of technological manufacturing procedure of Krk cheese...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} chemical and microbiological quality of raw milk from 30 farms of different sizes from eastern, central and southern Croatian regions. Samples of fresh raw milk (n= 360) are determined by the content of fat, protein, total solids, and the number of microorganisms and somatic cells. Analysed milk derived from Holstein, Simmental and Brown Swiss cows, and their crossbred. Chemical composition of milk was determined by infrared spectrophotometry, microbiological quality by milk epifluorescence flow cytometry, and the number of somatic cells in milk was determined by <b>fluoro-opto-electronic</b> <b>method.</b> The results of chemical quality of milk - of milk fat and protein entirely, for all groups of large and small farms in eastern, central and southern regions meet the requirements of the “Regulations on the Quality of Fresh Raw Milk”. Looking at the value of the total number of microorganisms, only a group of small agricultural holdings of the southern region do not meet the requirements prescribed by the Regulations on the Quality of Fresh Raw Milk in 2000. Small agricultural holdings of the southern region had significantly higher total number of microorganisms (P< 0. 0001) in relation to the other two groups. There was a statistically significant difference (P< 0. 01) between somatic cell count (SCC) in milk of all three region’s large agricultural holdings, while the SCC in milk of small agricultural holdings of different regions did not show statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of my {{study was to}} analyse the influence of selected factors in relation to somatic cell counts (SCC) in bulk milk samples of raw cow´s milk. Milk samples were tested in eight cowsheds with different technology of breeding and milking {{for a period of}} three years. The SCC values were determined by the <b>Fluoro-opto-electronic</b> <b>method</b> using the apparatus Fossomatic. A significant factor influencing the SCC was the season. The highest average values of the SCC were found in the summer months. The lowest average values of the SCC were determined in the loose bedded cubicle housing (250. 103. ml- 1), while the difference in the SCC compared to the loose bedding-free slatted floor housing (SCC average 317. 103. ml- 1) was highly statistically significant (p < 0, 001). In the tie stall with bedding was the SCC average 292. 103. ml- 1. A highly statistically significant difference in the SCC (p < 0, 001) was also demonstrated between breeds in the milking parlour (SCC average 265. 103. ml- 1) and breeds in the milking stall in the pipeline systems (SCC average 292. 103. ml- 1). It also showed a statistically highly significant difference in the SCC (p < 0, 001) between breeds dominated by the Holstein breed cows (SCC average 285. 103. ml- 1) and breeds with breed prevalence of the Czech Fleckvieh cows (SCC average 265. 103. ml- 1). The level of yield was also affected by the SCC. There was no statistically significant difference among the farms using grazing and breeding without any possibility of keeping cows on pasture...|$|E
