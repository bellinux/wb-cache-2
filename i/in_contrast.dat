5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> to the 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, {{and that they were}} capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E

Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E
