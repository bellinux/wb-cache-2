500|$|Peggy {{has been}} spoofed in several programmes, {{including}} the ITV cartoon sketch show 2DTV, and Harry Hill's TV Burp. In the BBC's Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around {{on her knees}} to exaggerate Barbara Windsor's petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase [...] "Get outta my pub!" [...] Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC's Dead Ringers, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona's impersonation, Windsor has said: [...] "she does me brilliantly. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was a great compliment. She made me realise my little hands wave around a lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not till I took Najdolene. Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was my heart. There's {{no need to}} say anything, {{now that}} I'm {{practically}} over it, is there?' ...|$|E
60|$|The bread was sour {{last week}} because mother wouldn't take my advice. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was too warm {{for it in}} the corner behind the stove.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then--I always {{expected}} to tell you--I {{did have a}} fancy for that girl, for Miss Vostrand, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so. <b>It's</b> like something that never happened. She wouldn't have me. That's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so; but <b>I</b> only <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> {{was no such}} thing, and I {{believe the}} child thought I meant to rebuke her for {{mentioning}} such frivolities, for she turned scarlet and held her peace." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> was a {{statuette}} of a god named Osiris and very, very ancient, probably quite {{five thousand}} years old, a statement at which she smiled a little; also {{that it came}} from Egypt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite positive. I was, by accident, {{the first}} that Mrs. Menlove named the matter to, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> might be much to her {{advantage}} if she took particular care it should go no further.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May marry her!" [...] cried Mr. Gilbert. [...] "Indeed, {{he shall}} marry her, if I have {{anything}} to say about it! My poor girl has been drooping ever since <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> could not be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> couldn't be done," [...] Munster went on. [...] "I {{told her}} the Martha hadn't a license for recruiting. 'Oh,' she said, 'it can't be done, eh?' and she stood and thought a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it," [...] {{answered}} Alice, very emphatically. [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>it</b> was {{she covered}} up her head with the bedclothes and declared, ma'am, {{that she would never}} get up until they were entirely gone out of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what mamma said when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> 'Depend upon <b>it,</b> my dear, such a choice will make the {{happiness}} of Miss Keeldar's life.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P.S.--I {{forgot to}} tell you that Lillie remarkably resembles the ivory {{miniature}} of our dear sainted mother. She was very much affected when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> think naturally Lillie has very much such a character as our mother; though circumstances, in her case, have been unfavorable to the development of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sweet! Sorrowful, indeed! About {{as sweet}} and sorrowful as the butcher to the lamb. Left you to judge! A {{refinement}} of cruelty! She had better have stayed away when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> {{was the only}} chance to save your life." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was Captain Davison from India; and {{described}} the appearance and behavior of the Captain. When I had finished speaking, {{she asked me to}} go and get her a glass of water; she felt unwell. But she was gone when I came back with the water.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> <b>It</b> was {{impossible}} to look into her face and not tell her. She listened eagerly, now with compassion, and now showing her white teeth in amusement. And when I had done, much to my discomfiture, she seized me in her strong arms and kissed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was hard-pressed," [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "and <b>it</b> was {{the only}} way to save him. Be brave, Lady Dennisford, for I have come to you for help!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was busy}} with the dog," [...] Lady Lydiard answered. [...] "Isabel Miller was of no use in the boudoir, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to seal <b>it</b> for me." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. If {{you mean}} {{how long has}} that lady been {{the apple of my}} eye, I'm not sure; but <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>it</b> until today.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Nesbit laughed. 'You, too! What has she {{to do with}} shyness? She has had her lesson; but you {{are like}} the rest! Your mamma {{actually}} proposing to take her likeness, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> {{was not to be}} thought of. There will be plenty to fill her with presumption.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you {{ring the bell}} for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know, if the basket was not {{finished}} tomorrow, for though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon having it done." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> {{was nothing}} to her any further than that as she knew her self to be {{originally}} not the same Creature she seem'd to be, but was of a sublime angelic Original; so by the Help of my recited Art I knew it too, and so far it might relate to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{he is not}} dead. By the way, I met Oom Croft's niece--the dark one. She is shut {{up there}} with the Captain, and she begged me to try and get them a pass to go home. Of course <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> was nonsense, and that they must stop and starve with the others." ...|$|R
60|$|She inquired {{after my}} luggage: <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> when <b>it</b> would arrive. She mused. At that moment a man's step was {{heard in the}} vestibule, hastily {{proceeding}} to the outer door. (I shall go on with this part of my tale as if I had understood all that passed; for though it was then scarce intelligible to me, I heard it translated afterwards).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{about his}} young woman. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the story; <b>it</b> was thoughtless, and yet I don't know that I was wrong. After all, Bolter {{could not have}} been a {{comfortable}} fellow to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was an accident," [...] groaned the Colonel. [...] "Your {{wife was}} looking at my new gun. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was loaded, and that she must be careful, and I thought she had put it down. The next thing that I heard was the report. It is all my cursed fault for leaving the {{cartridges}} in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said my aunt, suddenly; {{and this}} aroused us; [...] "it's a poky hole, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> would be. Let her thank the Lord she's got a man clever {{enough to get}} her out of it. I know him; he never could rest where he was put. Now he's at the bottom; he'll go up." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> {{was nothing}} but her own natural Picture, and that she knew well enough, and that I did not shew it her to inform her of it, but {{to let her know}} that I knew it too; that so she might make no Pretences of being {{offended}} when I talk'd familiarly to her of a Thing of this Nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Princess is much {{interested}} in you, and sends her love. She is impatient to take you under <b>her</b> care. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> will not be long--nor will it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hidden,' said Clara, 'yes, {{indeed it}} was, even from herself, because it never showed in manner, like my pride; she was gracious and affable {{to all the}} world. I heard the weeding-women saying, 'she had not one bit of pride,' and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>it,</b> she shook <b>her</b> head, and laughed sadly, and said that {{was the kind of}} thing which had taken her in.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> when <b>it</b> {{was that}} she had said them. But she did not {{remember}} about it. So then I knew that she had been asleep, or in a trance or an ecstasy of some kind, at that time. She bade me keep these and the other revelations to myself for the present, and I said I would, and kept the faith I promised.|$|R
60|$|After {{the reading}} {{of half a dozen}} pages during which she had not {{interrupted}} herself, she laid the manuscript in her lap, and asked me the time. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> wanted twenty minutes of twelve. She made no answer, but rose, put the manuscript in the drawer, and then returned with a little note which she had taken from her pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; and oh, Anne, {{she says}} I'm never {{to play with}} you again. I've cried and cried and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she's timing me by the clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I haven't much to spare; and I have {{relations}} in narrow circumstances--perhaps narrower than theirs. But {{that is not}} the point. Were I ever so rich I feel I could not rectify the past by money. I did not promise to enrich her. On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> would probably be dire poverty for both of us. But I did promise to make her my wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bunny was {{so frightened}} by what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> {{looked very much}} as if she would die of fright; but Sonny Bunny and I rubbed her ears hard, until we finally brought her around to that point where {{she was able to}} look danger in the face as one of our kind should, but, I am sorry to say, seldom does.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} <b>it.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> did <b>it</b> all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was just mad at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it? And it's quite true. That's the way {{we became}} Spooners. <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>it,</b> but, somehow I wish I had now. It always seemed that she didn't think that I was anybody." ...|$|R
