50|$|The memory <b>data</b> <b>lane</b> {{controllers}} {{are different}} on the ANS {{from the ones}} on the PM9500, presumably because of added support for parity memory. The ANS memory <b>data</b> <b>lane</b> controllers are 343S1161 instead of 343S1141 as on the PM9500. However, the memory structure is the same with two banks of DIMM slots and support for memory interleaving when corresponding slots in different banks contain identical memory DIMMs. The ANS does have eight memory DIMM slots instead of the PM9500's twelve, but other Hammerhead-based machines such as the PM8500 also carry only eight memory DIMM slots.|$|E
50|$|MHL {{uses the}} same Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) as HDMI to carry video, audio, and auxiliary data. However, MHL differs from HDMI in {{that there is only}} one differential pair to carry the TMDS <b>data</b> <b>lane,</b> compared to HDMI's four (three data lanes, plus the clock). Therefore these three logical data channels are instead time-division multiplexed into the single physical MHL <b>data</b> <b>lane</b> (i.e., with the logical channels sent sequentially), and the clock signal carried as a common mode signal of this pair. From MHL 3 onwards, the method for carrying the clock signal changed to being carried separately on the MHL CBUS pin instead.|$|E
50|$|NVLink is a wire based {{communications}} protocol for near range semiconductor communications developed by Nvidia {{that can be}} used for data and control code transfers in processor systems between CPUs and GPUs and solely between GPUs. NVLink specifies a point-to-point connections with data rates of 20 and 25 Gbit/s (v1.0/v2.0) per <b>data</b> <b>lane</b> in one data direction. Total data rates in real world systems are 160 and 300 GByte/s (v1.0/v2.0) for the total system sum of input and output data streams. NVLink products introduced to date focus on the high-performance application space. NVLINK, first announced in March 2014, uses a proprietary High-Speed Signaling interconnect (NVHS) developed by Nvidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising the lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV <b>data</b> <b>lanes</b> from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 <b>lanes</b> to carry <b>data).</b> The <b>data</b> <b>lanes</b> runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three <b>data</b> <b>lanes).</b> The <b>lane</b> <b>data</b> structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|R

50|$|At the {{physical}} layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane {{and one or}} more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first <b>data</b> <b>lane</b> (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse transmission direction. When more than one lane is used, they are used in parallel to transmit data, with each sequential byte in the stream traveling on the next lane. That is, if 4 lanes are being used, 4 bits are transmitted simultaneously, one on each lane. The link operates in either low power (LP) mode or high speed (HS) mode. In low power mode, the high speed clock is disabled and signal clocking information {{is embedded in the}} data. In this mode, the data rate is insufficient to drive a display, but is usable for sending configuration information and commands. High speed mode enables the high speed clock (at frequencies from tens of megahertz to over one gigahertz) that acts as the bit clock for the data lanes. Clock speeds vary by the requirements of the display. High speed mode is still designed to reduce power usage due to its low voltage signaling and parallel transfer ability.|$|E

5|$|The {{doubling}} of lane rate and increasing of <b>data</b> <b>lanes</b> from 3 to 4, raises the effective bandwidth to 48 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3). On using DSC, it {{has got a}} maximum compression of 3:1 and this effectively increases the bandwidth to 144 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3 * 3). This much bandwidth {{can be used for}} sending up to 10K/60 Hz video in 4:4:4 format with 24-bit color (i.e. 4K/60Hz * 4 * 16/9).

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} Master Thesis is the {{development}} of a field experiment at the B- 23 freeway accessing the city of Barcelona. The work aims to be a future reference for researchers, as it provides a unique database and also some guidelines for designing similar experiments. All the relevant issues faced during the experiment are explained in detail making the reader aware of the main difficulties. The experiment intends to provide enough quality data to definitely answer how the DSL affects traffic in a real freeway. Some of its supposed benefits are an increase of the maximum capacity and travel time reduction in congested periods and less air pollution. These possible benefits are still subject of intense scientific debate. The main reason for that is the lack of adequate data in order to prove or discard these assumptions. The present work is a first step towards achieving this goal. Video analysis is subject to a specific focus. Video tape recordings are the source measurement for obtaining lane changing <b>data.</b> <b>Lane</b> changes play a fundamental role in freeway traffic efficiency.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Philip Lane {{looks at the}} role of {{external}} funding in the funding of infrastructure. He starts with a review of literature which is, in large part, a review of Philip’s own work. This is appropriate given that the body of work he has put together, particularly with Gian Maria Milesi‑Ferretti, is the standard-setter {{when looking at the}} issue of cross-border financial stocks and flows. The difference between Lane’s paper and the previous paper in this session by Marcel Fratzscher is primarily one of frequency. Fratzscher’s paper examines weekly data while Lane’s paper utilises decadal <b>data.</b> <b>Lane</b> uses this analysis of the data on external positions to examine the role of foreign capital flows in funding infrastructure. He notes that accessing this larger pool of capital available offshore for infrastructure reduces the likelihood of crowding out that could occur if only domestic funding were sought. I am not sure I would completely agree with this argument. Capital is essentially fungible, so there is no particular reason (on this grounds) why offshore funding is more desirable for funding infrastructure rather than any other part of the economy where desired investment or spending exceeds savings. For example, infrastructure could be entirely domestically funded, but other areas of corporate activity could be funded from abroad...|$|E

50|$|New {{and large}} (>15") TFT {{displays}} often use LVDS signaling that transmits the same contents as the parallel interface (Hsync, Vsync, RGB) but will put control and RGB bits {{into a number}} of serial transmission lines synchronized to a clock whose rate is equal to the pixel rate. LVDS transmits seven bits per clock per data line, with six bits being data and one bit used to signal if the other six bits need to be inverted in order to maintain DC balance. Low quality TFT displays often have three data lines and therefore only directly support 18 bits per pixel, while better ones have a fourth data line so they can support 24 bits per pixel, which delivers truecolor. Ultra high end models can support even more colors by adding more lanes, that's how 30-bit color can be supported by five <b>data</b> <b>lanes.</b> Panel manufacturers are slowly replacing LVDS with Internal DisplayPort and Embedded DisplayPort, which allow sixfold reduction of the number of differential pairs.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{software}} defined radio (SDR) describes a signal processing system for wireless communications that allows performing major parts of the physical layer processing in software. SDR systems are more flexible and have lower development costs than traditional systems based on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Yet, SDR requires programmable processor architectures that can meet the throughput and energy efficiency requirements of current third generation (3 G) and future fourth generation (4 G) wireless standards for mobile devices. Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) processors operate on long data vectors in parallel <b>data</b> <b>lanes</b> and can achieve a good ratio of computing power to energy consumption. Hence, SIMD processors could {{be the basis of}} future SDR systems. Yet, SIMD processors only achieve a high efficiency if all parallel <b>data</b> <b>lanes</b> can be utilized. This thesis investigates the scalability of SIMD processing for algorithms required in 4 G wireless systems; i. e. the scaling of performance and energy consumption with increasing SIMD vector lengths is explored. The basis of the exploration is a scalable SIMD processor architecture, which also supports long instruction word (LIW) execution and can be configured with four different permutation networks for vector element permutations. Radix- 2 and mixed-radix fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, sphere decoding for multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems, and the decoding of quasi-cyclic lowdensity parity check (LDPC) codes have been examined, as these are key algorithms for 4 G wireless systems. The results show that the performance of all algorithms scales with the SIMD vector length, yet there are different constraints on the ratios between algorithm and architecture parameters. The radix- 2 FFT algorithm allows close to linear speedups if the FFT size is at least twice the SIMD vector length, the mixed-radix FFT algorithm requires the FFT size to be a multiple of the squared SIMD width. The performance of the implemented sphere decoding algorithm scales linearly with the SIMD vector length. The scalability of LDPC decoding is determined by the expansion factor of the quasicyclic code. Wider SIMD processors offer better performance and also require less energy than processors with a shorter vector length for all considered algorithms. The results for different permutations networks show that a simple permutation network is sufficient for most applications...|$|R
