5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid <b>indicia.</b> Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the stamping privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2008, in Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008), Judge Larson ruled {{again that}} the Superboy {{character}} was not a work for hire. Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs' claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and <b>indicia</b> as they appeared in Action Comics #1 (but not prior to or after that). Judge Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and <b>indicia.</b>|$|E

25|$|FATCA {{is used by}} {{government}} personnel to detect <b>indicia</b> of U.S. persons and their assets and to enable cross-checking where assets have been self-reported by individuals to the IRS or to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). U.S. persons, regardless of residence location and regardless of dual citizenship, are required to self-report their non-U.S. assets to FinCEN on an annual basis. According to qualification criteria, individuals are also required to report this information on IRS information-reporting form 8938. FATCA will allow detection of persons who have not self-reported, enabling collection of large penalties. FATCA allows government personnel to locate U.S. persons not living in the United States, so as to assess U.S. tax or penalties.|$|E
25|$|Effects on non-Americans. The {{financial}} information of non-US spouses {{and family members}} who share accounts with US persons are reported to the IRS under FATCA. Moreover, persons who are not US residents and are not US persons and do not share accounts with US persons still must self-certify said status when opening a bank account outside the US at any FFI. According to the FATCA IGA, if such a person does not self-certify said status, that person cannot open a bank account at that institution. Canada and United Kingdom have interpreted the IGAs differently and believe that non-US persons who fail to self-certify shall not be refused a bank account. However, non-cooperating non-US persons shall be FATCA reported {{in the same way}} as those persons who have US <b>indicia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a 2010 United States {{federal law}} {{requiring}} all non-U.S. ('foreign') financial institutions (FFIs) to search their records for customers with <b>indicia</b> of 'U.S.-person' status, {{such as a}} U.S. place of birth, and to report the assets and identities of such persons to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. FATCA also requires such persons to self-report their non-U.S. financial assets annually to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on form 8938, which is {{in addition to the}} older and further redundant requirement to self-report them annually to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on form 114 (also known as 'FBAR'). Like U.S. income tax law, FATCA applies to U.S. residents and also to U.S. citizens and green card holders residing in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{conversion}} of nonexempt assets into exempt assets {{on the eve}} of bankruptcy would not be <b>indicia</b> of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a {{conversion of}} nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.|$|E
500|$|The {{publisher}} was Crownpoint Publications for {{the first}} twelve issues, though the name was dropped from the <b>indicia</b> starting with the December 1953 issue. [...] From September 1955 the publisher was Peter Hamilton, who was editor throughout. [...] The price was 2/- (10p) {{for all but the}} last two issues, which were priced at 2/6 (12.5p).|$|E
500|$|However, in Florida v. J.L., the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} police {{officers}} {{did not have}} reasonable suspicion to detain a suspect based on an anonymous tip “that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.” The Court held that the tip [...] "lacked the moderate <b>indicia</b> of reliability present in White and essential to the Court’s decision in that case. The anonymous call concerning J.L. provided no predictive information, and therefore left the police without means to test the informant’s knowledge or credibility.” The Court declined to create a [...] "firearm exception" [...] for anonymous tips, but the court noted in dicta that a tip describing a bomb threat need not bear the <b>indicia</b> of reliability otherwise required of other anonymous tips. The Supreme Court of California would later rely upon this [...] "bomb exception" [...] in People v. Wells, when it ruled that an anonymous tip that accurately described a vehicle “weaving all over the roadway” justified a traffic stop. The California court held that “considerations of public safety and common sense” permit officers to conduct traffic stops based on anonymous tips [...] "to confirm the officer’s reasonable suspicion of intoxicated driving before a serious traffic accident can occur.” ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient <b>indicia</b> of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that <b>indicia</b> of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that reasonable cause for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number of the pickup truck, Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows the other car was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 emergency system are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E
500|$|Baronet Press, a small New York {{publishing}} house, {{agreed to}} publish A Contract with God, which bears the credit [...] "Produced by Poorhouse Press" [...] of [...] "White Plains, N.Y." [...] on its <b>indicia</b> page. Eisner had {{originally intended to}} call the book Tenement Stories, Tales from the Bronx, or A Tenement in the Bronx but Baronet titled it A Contract with God, after the lead story, as the term [...] "tenement" [...] was not widely known outside the eastern US. The trade paperback carried the term [...] "graphic novel", {{though it is a}} collection of stories rather than a novel. [...] As Baronet was not financially sound, Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published.|$|E
500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a [...] "scathing" [...] dissenting opinion, {{in which}} {{he argued that the}} tip was unreliable, and that the majority's opinion {{threatened}} the freedom and liberty of all citizens. Likewise, many commentators have noted Navarette represented a departure from earlier precedent, and that the opinion opened the door for expansive new police powers. Some commentators have also noted that the case leaves open several important questions, including the unanswered question of whether anonymous reports of extremely dangerous behavior require fewer <b>indicia</b> of reliability before police may act upon those reports. Other scholars have argued it was highly unlikely that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were actually driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they were stopped by police.|$|E
500|$|In Illinois v. Gates, the Supreme Court {{established}} that courts should apply a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test {{to determine whether}} an anonymous tip is sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to issue an arrest warrant. Although officers in Gates did not personally witness any criminal activity, the Supreme Court held that the anonymous tip in question was reliable, because officers could verify several events predicted by the anonymous tip. Seven years after Gates, the Supreme Court held in Alabama v. White that an anonymous tip was sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to justify a temporary detention, because the tip accurately predicted several key details. Although the Court conceded that White was a [...] "close case", the tip in question [...] "exhibited sufficient <b>indicia</b> of reliability" [...] to justify a temporary detention. The Court explained that [...] if [...] "an informant is shown to be right about some things, he is probably right about other facts that he has alleged, including {{the claim that the}} object of the tip is engaged in criminal activity." ...|$|E
500|$|Lorenzo Prado Navarette and Jose Prado Navarette {{filed an}} appeal in the California Court of Appeal, {{but the court}} affirmed the {{judgment}} of the Superior Court. Relying on the [...] "public safety" [...] exception established in People v. Wells, the court held that [...] "ongoing danger to other motorists [...] the stop without direct corroboration of the vehicle's illegal activity". The court noted that the vehicle was traveling on an [...] "undivided two-lane road, thus raising the risk of a collision with oncoming traffic, which poses a particular risk to human life and limb." [...] However, the court also held that the [...] "anonymous tip itself had several <b>indicia</b> of reliability — the content of the tip strongly suggested it came from the victim and the tipster accurately described the appearance, location and direction of the vehicle." [...] Lorenzo and Jose appealed again to the Supreme Court of California, but the Court declined to review their case. They then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted their petition for certiorari on October 1, 2013.|$|E
500|$|In July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts & Vinter a {{substantial}} sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter {{to focus on}} their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing New Worlds, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for {{a grant from the}} British Arts Council in late 1966. [...] In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that New Worlds would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the formal grant certification was delayed until at least May. [...] The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. [...] A publisher still needed to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. [...] While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories. [...] Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. [...] These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the <b>indicia.</b> [...] Science Fantasy, which by this time had been retitled SF Impulse, was not continued but was merged with New Worlds as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of SF Impulses design or content was visible in New Worlds.|$|E

2500|$|Journey into Mystery was retitled Thor (per the <b>indicia,</b> or The Mighty Thor per most covers) with issue #126 (March 1966).

2500|$|Admission of out {{of court}} statements, therefore, is and has been possible.
