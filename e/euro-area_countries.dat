To a large degree, the decoupling of the Danish economy reflects fundamental changes in the Danish economic policy during this period. Towards the end of the 1990 's a remarkable business-cycle convergence occurred between most of the industrialised countries, as documented in a series of empirical analyses. In the same period, the correlation between Danish and Euro area business cycles increased markedly.

A specific focus is on Greece. The paper extends the seminal Balassa-Samuelson model to include international capital markets, placing a particular focus on their impact on national wage policies. Capital flows are assumed to be able to invert the traditional direction of transmission of real wage increases from the tradable sector to the non-tradable sector and to cause real wages to increase beyond productivity increases. The augmented Balassa-Samuelson model is extended to trace cyclical deviations of real exchange rates from the productivity-driven equilibrium path. Panel estimations for the period from 1995 to 2013 show evidence of the Balassa-Samuelson effect if Greece is excluded from the panel. For Greece, this in turn provides evidence in favour of capital inflow-driven real wage increases in excess of productivity increases...|$|R

We quantify the linkages among banks’ equity performance and indicators of sovereign stress by using panel GMM to estimate a three-equation system that examines the impact of sovereign stress, as reflected in both sovereign spreads and sovereign ratings, on bank share prices. We use data for a panel of five <b>euro-area</b> stressed <b>countries.</b> Our findings indicate that a recursive relationship between sovereigns and banks operated during the euro-area crisis. Specifically, for the five crisis countries considered shocks to sovereign spreads fed-through to sovereign ratings, which affected commercial banks’ equity-prices.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{cross-country}} {{variation of the}} fiscal stimulus and the exchange rate adjustment propagated by the global crisis of 2008 - 9, identifying the role of economic structure in accounting for the heterogeneity of response. We find that greater de facto fiscal space prior to the global crisis and lower trade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009 - 2010 (where the de facto fiscal space is the inverse of the average tax-years {{it would take to}} repay the public debt). Lowering the 2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5. 94) down to the average level of the Euro minus the <b>Euro-area</b> peripheral <b>countries</b> (1. 97), was associated with a larger crisis stimulus in 2009 - 11 of 2. 78 GDP percentage points. Joint estimation of fiscal stimuli and exchange rate depreciations indicates that higher trade openness was associated with a smaller fiscal stimulus and a higher depreciation rate during the crisis. Overall, the results are in line with the predictions of the neo-Keynesian open-economy model. ...|$|R

40|$|This Policy Contribution {{reviews the}} major {{challenges}} faced by the euro area, and discusses recent initiatives and the way forward. Some implications are drawn out for Latvia’s euro accession, {{which is likely to}} be beneficial on balance. The euro area faces three major challenges: (1) high private and public debt in some of its parts together with a requirement for competitiveness adjustment that in some countries has barely started; (2) weak growth outlook; (3) continued banking-sector fragility that, with sovereign stress, feeds a negative feedback loop. The euro area has agreed many significant measures to overcome these problems, including the European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal compact. The 21 February agreement on Greece removes a major source of financial instability even though it is likely that further debt reductions will be needed. Significant concerns remain, the most important of which are the slow real economic adjustment and the largely unaddressed banking-sovereign fragility. The fiscal compact raises the issue of appropriate fiscal stabilisation tools at the <b>euro-area</b> level. <b>Countries</b> that will soon join the euro should actively shape the debate about the further development of the overall set-up. For Latvia, joining the euro makes sense because Latvia has kept its exchange rate fixed and has undergone internal adjustment.

30|$|After the {{occurrence}} of the Brexit, there is increasing uncertainty about its consequences for European countries, especially when additional nations are starting to evaluate leaving the Euro Area. An economic recession represents the main fear especially when {{the effects of the}} Subprime crisis are fresh on mind of agents. A lesson thought by the Sovereign crisis is that economic crises have heterogeneous impacts across <b>Euro-Area</b> <b>countries.</b> This evidence is interesting given this contradicts the achievement of an optimum currency area. This issue can certainly affect expectations of agents for future disturbances. Empirical and theoretical evidence shows that public policies across Euro Area are homogenous (Kose et al. 2012; Calderón and Fuentes 2014); nevertheless, there are still important differences across these countries (Krolzig and Toro 2005; Staehr 2008; Krugman et al. 2012; Kolasa 2013). For this reason, recession phases can be triggered by different roots and can have different characteristics among <b>Euro-Area</b> <b>countries.</b> For instance, the Sovereign crisis had dissimilar impacts across European nations. While some countries had a high and persistent unemployment rate during several years, e.g. Spain, others had minimums effects on the market labor, e.g. Germany. In such an environment, tools which help to characterize the different features of recession phases across <b>Euro-Area</b> <b>countries,</b> which seem to have marked differences, are useful to anticipate deeps impacts of future crises.|$|E

Our estimates indicate that policies have reacted to the state of public finances in a stabilizing manner. The European rules have significantly affected the behaviour of countries with excessive deficits. Apart from these cases, the rules appear to have reaffirmed existing preferences. We find a relatively large symmetrical counter-cyclical reaction of fiscal policy and strong evidence of a political budget cycle.

30|$|Our {{findings}} {{are useful for}} policy implications. In order to enjoy the benefits of an optimum currency area, Euro-Area integrants should fulfill a series of requirements {{that allow them to}} homogenize their economies. For this reason, the synchronization of expectations plays an important role to minimize heterogeneous impacts of centralized policies, i.e. monetary policy. This paper reveals significant differences in the expectations for Germany, Spain, and the Euro Area. Therefore, level of requirement fulfillment across <b>Euro-Area</b> <b>countries</b> {{does not seem to be}} enough to synchronize expectations. This may be the reason of the heterogeneous impacts of the Sovereign crisis across <b>Euro-Area</b> <b>countries.</b> For instance, different European economies had booms in housing prices during the economic crisis in 2010; however, Germany did not have this problem (Krugman et al. 2012). Furthermore, there are important differences in the impacts on the employment that can be related to the heterogeneity in the wage flexibility (Pino and Soto 2014), which contradicts the achievement of the optimum currency area.|$|E

We apply an approach developed by Bohn who proposes to study whether the primary surplus to GDP ratio is a positive function of the debt to GDP ratio which does not need arbitrary discount rates that other approaches have to assume. By controlling {{for the impact of}} other variables in this process, we can show that for the above mentioned countries fiscal policy shows evidence for sustainability, although the three percent rule of the Maastricht treaty might temporarily be violated.

The letter demonstrated that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target rate closely resembled the policy rate predicted by the Taylor rule for the euro area as a whole.
