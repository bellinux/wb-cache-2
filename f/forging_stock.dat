40|$|Abstract. High-precision near-net shape {{parts with}} {{excellent}} surface qualities {{can be produced}} with the forging process {{with a minimum of}} finishing operations thanks to the good formability of aluminium alloys. There has been a rapid increase in the use of aluminium forgings predominantly in the automotive industry, where weight savings for reduced fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is mandated by legislation. Aluminium forgings provide, in addition to low weight, high strength, good corrosion resistance and a fibrous grain structure to improve fatigue resistance. Typical commercial <b>forging</b> <b>stock</b> is the round bars produced by the extrusion of cast billets. An alternative process route that has received increasing attention in recent years is the casting of <b>forging</b> <b>stock</b> by a horizontal direct chill casting technique to make smaller billets without the need for extrusion to reduce their diameter. The anisotropy imparted to the <b>forging</b> <b>stock</b> via extrusion, often regarded as useful for the forging, is certainly missing in the former. However, cast stock has been reported to be more resistant to the formation of coarse surface grains than the extruded counterpart. The present work was undertaken to compare the casting and extrusion routes for the manufacture of 6082 alloy <b>forging</b> <b>stock...</b>|$|E

In turn something less than one third of this estimated twenty quads of energy is actually required to produce the product. This broad sweeping statement covers many sins and many virtues. The blast furnace, for example, is the largest user of energy per net ton of steel produced and operates at approximately 67 % of theoretical efficiency. The slot forge furnace, used to reheat steel fat hot forging, operates at approximately 10 % of theoretical efficiency. Actually steel <b>forging</b> <b>stock</b> can also be reheated at about 50 % efficiency {{and this has been}} done by a DOE sponsored contractor. The technology is, in fact, being commercialized by the contractor and its rapid diffusion by DOE will be actively encouraged...|$|E

40|$|Metals with grain sizes {{smaller than}} 1 -micrometer have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} past decade. These materials have been classified as ultra fine grain (UFG) materials (grain sizes {{in the range of}} 100 to 1000 -nm) and nano-materials (grain size half the melting temperature on the absolute scale) and very low strain rates (< 0. 0001 /s). UFG metals have been shown to exhibit superplastic characteristics at lower temperature and higher strain rates, making this phenomenon more practical for manufacturing. This enables part unitization and forging more complex and net shape parts. Laboratory studies have shown that this is particularly true for UFG metals produced by SPD techniques. This combination of properties makes UFG metals produced by SPD very attractive as machining, forging or extrusion stock, both {{from the point of view}} of formability as well as energy and cost saving. However, prior to this work there had been no attempt to transfer these potential benefits observed in the laboratory scale to industrial shop floor. The primary reason for this was that the laboratory scale studies had been conducted to develop a scientific understanding of the processes that result in grain refinement during SPD. Samples that had been prepared in the laboratory scale were typically only about 10 -mm diameter and 50 -mm long (about 0. 5 -inch diameter and 2 -inches long). The thrust of this project was three-fold: (i) to show that the ECAE/P process can be scaled up to produce long samples, i. e., a continuous severe plastic deformation (CSPD) process, (ii) show the process can be scaled up to produce large cross section samples that could be used as <b>forging</b> <b>stock,</b> and (iii) use the large cross-section samples to produce industrial size forgings and demonstrate the potential energy and cost savings that can be realized if SPD processed stock is adopted by the forging industry. Aluminum alloy AA- 6061 was chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach used. The CSPD process developed using the principles of chamber-less extrusion and drawing, and was demonstrated using rolling and wire drawing equipment that was available at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In a parallel effort, ECAE/P dies were developed for producing 100 -mm square cross section SPD billets for subsequent forging. This work was carried out at Intercontinental Manufacturing Co. (IMCO), Garland TX. Forging studies conducted with the ECAE/P billets showed that many of the potential benefits of using UFG material can be realized. In particular, the material yield can be increased, and the amount of material that is lost as scrap can be reduced by as much as 50 %. Forging temperatures can also be reduced by over 150 ºC, resulting in energy savings in the operation of billet heating furnaces. Looking at only the energy required to make forgings from stock materials, estimated energy savings associated with reduced scrap and lower furnace operating temperatures were greater than 40 % if ECAE/P stock material was used instead of conventionally extruded stock. Subsequent heat treatment of the forged materials to the T 6 condition showed that the mechanical properties of parts made from the ECAE/P stock material were the same as of those made from conventional extruded stock material. Therefore, the energy and cost savings benefits can be realized by the use SPD processed material as <b>forging</b> <b>stock</b> without sacrificing properties in the final part...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades equal channel angular {{processing}} (ECAP) and other severe plastic deformation (SPD) processes have been shown, in the laboratory scale, to produce material with promising properties for industrial applications. In particular, ultrafine grain (UFG) metals produced by ECAP process, for example, have been shown to exhibit higher strain rate sensitivity at lower temperatures and higher strain rates. These factors translate to improved hot formability. However, scale up of these processes to manufacture industrial size components has not been widely undertaken. In this study, billets of annealed AA 6061 with 12. 5 mm (0. 5 -in), 50 mm (2 -in) and 100 mm (4 -in) square cross section were ECAP processed. For the first time, these larger SPD billets were used as starting stock for subsequent hot forging. Several parts were forged on an industrial scale press with the UFG material, as well as conventional stock materials. These parts varied in complexity, as well as size in order to cover the variability in industrial components. This paper will present the effect of scaling up on the mechanical properties, microstructure, and the hot workability of the alloy from the laboratory scale (12. 5 mm) to industrial scale (100 mm). Results show that both the forging temperature of the billets and the starting billet size can be substantially decreased compared to conventional forging practice. Therefore, the use of SPD materials, as <b>forging</b> <b>stock,</b> results in decreased energy usage and increased material yield. Results presented will include examples of forged parts, estimated energy savings {{associated with the use of}} SPDUFG stock, and properties after forging and subsequent heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|British Alcan Aluminium plc {{installed}} {{a small scale}} melting and casting facility for aluminium-lithium based alloys at the Alcan Plate factory, Birmingham, England that was completed in early 1985. Since May 1985 the Lital alloys have been in regular production {{in the form of}} sheet, plate, extrusion, tube and <b>forging</b> <b>stock.</b> During the two years of production, {{attention has been paid to}} optimisation of all aspects of the manufacture of the semi-fabricated products and considerable improvements in properties have been achieved. This paper outlines the progress and compares current typical properties with guaranteed minima and the properties of the established aerospace alloys. Good damage tolerant properties have been achieved with Lital C (8090) in a lightly aged condition. In sheet form toughness is slightly better than that of 2024 T 3 at the same strength level and the corrosion/stress corrosion behaviour of the Lital alloy is superior to that of 2024. In plate and extruded forms strength properties match those for 2024 while toughness in the rolling plane is superior. Though thickness toughness matches that of 2024 while fatigue crack growth rate is less than for 2024. In the medium strength Lital A (8090) condition considerably improved strengths and strength/toughness relationships have been achieved by optimisation of stretching and final ageing practices. Strengths attainable are close to the targets originally set for the high strength Lital B (8091). Plate up to 100 mm thick has been produced exhibiting good ductility and fracture toughness in the short transverse direction. In sheet form the medium strength alloy is unrecrystallised and, therefore, exhibits some anisotropy of properties but strength targets are being achieved. Demand for the 8090 alloy has reduced the development time available for the high strength Lital B (8091) alloy. So far only limited production of Lital B has occurred at Kitts Green but very good strength properties have been achieved. Using optimised stretching and ageing practices, it appears that very high strength levels can be achieved in thin 8091 plate, although this is by sacrifice of the through thickness properties...|$|E

These specimens had plane proportions conforming to ASTM E 399 and covered a thickness range of from 1 / 32 to 1 / 2 in. Two sets of bend specimens were tested, one having fatigue cracks and the other 0. 5 mil radius notches.

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by <b>forging</b> or <b>stock</b> removal. <b>Forged</b> blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the <b>forging</b> and <b>stock</b> removal processes. <b>Forging</b> tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} rapid solidification {{technology for}} processing reactive and refractory alloys, utilized to produce {{large quantities of}} melt-spun filaments of NiAl, is presented. The melt-spun filaments are pulverized to fine particle sizes, and subsequently consolidated by hot extrusion or hot isostatic pressing. Rapid solidification process gives rise to very fine-grained microstructures. However, exposure to elevated temperature during hot consolidation leads to grain growth. Alloying agents such as borides, carbides, and tungsten can pin the grain boundaries and retard the grain growth. Various alloy compositions are investigated. The eventual goal is to utilize the hot-extruded and <b>forged</b> <b>stock</b> to grow single-crystal NiAl blades for advanced gas-turbine engine applications. Single-crystal NiAl, containing a uniform dispersion of carbide strengthening precipitates, is expected to lead to highly creep-resistant turbine blades, and is of considerable interest to the aerospace propulsion industry...|$|R

The experiments were performed as part of investigations on the residual life of COPV tanks being used in Space Shuttle Orbiters. Measured properties included tensile strength, compressive strength, reversed loading cycles to simulate liner proof strains, and cyclic fatigue loading to demonstrate the ability to sustain 1000 cycles after liner buckling. The liner material came from a salvaged 40 in. Columbia (orbiter 102) tank (SN 029), and tensile strength measurements were made on both boss-transition (thick) and membrane regions (thin). The average measured yield strength was 131 ksi in the boss-transition and membrane regions, in good agreement with measurements made on 1970 s vintage <b>forged</b> plate <b>stock.</b> However, Young s modulus was 17. 4 +/- 0. 3 Msi, somewhat higher than typical handbook values (approx. 16 Msi). The fracture toughness, as estimated from a failed fatigue specimen, was 74 ksi/sq in, in reasonable agreement with standardized measurements made on 1970 s vintage <b>forged</b> plate <b>stock.</b> Low cycle fatigue of a buckled test specimen implied that as-imprinted liners can sustain over 4000 load cycles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a <b>forged</b> <b>stock</b> {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R
