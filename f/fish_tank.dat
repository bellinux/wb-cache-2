She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} <b>fish</b> <b>tank</b> ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic <b>fish</b> <b>tank</b> in Fiore's house.|$|E

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the <b>fish</b> <b>tank,</b> assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a <b>fish</b> <b>tank</b> {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A <b>fish</b> <b>tank</b> in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E

25|$|Measurements {{have shown}} that typically, male {{electric}} fish that’s dominating usually has lower EOD frequency and longer EOD duration. An experiment has shown that, when two males are placed in the same <b>fish</b> <b>tank,</b> both fishes enhance their EOD in the first short period of time. However, after leaving the fishes in a dark period (mimicking night time), the male with higher EOD amplitude, which is also usually the male with bigger body size, will further enhance its EOD; on the contrary, the male with smaller body size/ smaller EOD does not enhance its EOD.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OnlyRecent trends {{reveal that}} fish rearing has became popular in Ogun State with {{the influx of}} new {{entrants}} into fish farming due to increasing demand for fish and fish products {{as well as an}} increase in awareness of relevant technologies. The need to study yield and revenue of fish cultured in dug-out fish ponds and <b>fish</b> <b>tanks</b> has become crucial for food security and sustainability of fish enclosures for fish production. The study was aimed at identify factors influencing the yield and revenue of Clarias gariepinus in two different fish enclosures (dugout and <b>fish</b> <b>tanks).</b> A three stage sampling technique was used to select 240 fish farmers located in the four Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) zones in Ogun State, Nigeria. Primary data collected through the questionnaire were analyzed by means of descriptive and multiple regressions statistics. Result show that 47. 1 % and 39. 6 % fish farmers adopted <b>fish</b> <b>tanks</b> and dug-out <b>fish</b> ponds respectively, while 13. 3 % adopted both on their farms...|$|R
25|$|In May 1902, Méliès {{made the}} film A Trip to the Moon which was {{loosely based on}} Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon. In the film, Méliès stars as Professor Barbenfouillis, a {{character}} similar to the astronomer he played in The Astronomer's Dream in 1898. Professor Barbenfouillis is the President of the Astronomer's Club and proposes an expedition to the Moon. A space vehicle {{in the form of}} a large artillery shell is built in his laboratory, and he uses it to launch six men (including himself) on a voyage to the Moon. The vehicle is shot out of a large cannon into space and hits the Man in the Moon in the eye. The group explores the Moon's surface before going to sleep. As they dream, they are observed by the Moon goddess Phoebe, played by Bleuette Bernon, who causes it to snow. Later, while underground, they are attacked and captured by a group of Moon aliens, played by acrobats from the Folies Bergère. Taken before the alien king, they manage to escape and are chased back to their spaceship. Then, with the aid of a rope attached to the spaceship, the men, along with an alien, fall from the Moon back to Earth, landing in the ocean (where a superimposed <b>fish</b> <b>tank</b> creates the illusion of the deep ocean). Eventually the spaceship is towed ashore and the returning adventurers are celebrated by the townspeople. At 14 minutes, it was Méliès' longest film up to that date and cost 10,000 francs to produce.|$|E

40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the association of hydroponic lettuce cultivation with residues from a fish intensive breeding system, a project {{was carried out in}} the Aquaculture Center in the FCAV-UNESP at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.

After this process, water returned back to the <b>fish</b> <b>tanks.</b> Three varieties of lettuce, constituting the treatments with four repetitions were evaluated.

Their concentration was close to that found in nutrient solutions, used for lettuce hydroponic cultivation, except for potassium and magnesium.
