5|$|Although the {{entrance}} to the pass had been secured by a regiment, the remainder of the 10th Cavalry Brigade did not reinforce the regiment. The brigade commander, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse had disobeyed divisional orders to do so and when the brigade finally advanced, twice got lost. In consequence, Barrow, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, relieved Howard-Vyse of his command on the spot. Lieutenant Colonel W. G.

5|$|Cumberland's {{neighbour}} club Western Suburbs {{had used}} {{black and white}} as their colours, which {{had been taken from}} Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle <b>green</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club, as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.|$|E

5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the <b>green</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll <b>green</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E

Prior to his junior year, he was named an alternate captain for the Big Green, going on to score a college career-high 12 goals and 28 points over 33 games. Glass made his second appearance in the ECAC's third-place game, winning 3–2 against Colgate.

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the <b>green</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E

When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.|$|E
