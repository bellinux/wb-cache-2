25|$|In the 1970s, {{wastewater}} {{was becoming}} an increasing problem. All of the city's untreated wastewater were being discharged into the Bogotá river {{and ultimately the}} reservoir behind the Muña dam. The community of Muña brought a lawsuit against EAAB, CAR, EMGESA, and the district government for negligence. The Tribunal of the Department of Cundinamarca ultimately decided for the community of Muña and further required the parties to create a review process and action plan to address the grievances brought forth by Muña. The Tribunal reserved the right to force {{a decision by the}} defendants if they did not make suitable progress on the mandate. The defendants appealed and the process went under review again. Upon further review, a judge ruled again in favor of Muña and delegated shared responsibilities to CAR, EAAB, and the District. The defendants agreed to the terms set by the court ruling and the prevailing legal document was called Convenio 171 and was signed by all parties in 2007. Convenio 171 calls for CAR to finance and construct the upgrade and expansion of the Salitre WWTP. CAR did this by creating a special account for the Bogotá wastewater program called Fondos Para Inversiones Ambientales en Bogotá (FIAB) (Funds for <b>environmental</b> <b>investment</b> in Bogotá). EAAB agreed to construct the new interceptors to the forthcoming Canoas WWTP.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a simple {{framework}} in macroeconomics for evaluating <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> that bear national significance.

The framework developed here shows that the recognition of environmental capital depreciation in macroeconomics permits the differentiation between various <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> in terms of their environmental impacts. These impacts are measured in terms of the costs of abating pollutants associated with climate change. The framework and its application are illustrated with reference to <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> in Vietnam. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{challenge of}} any company is to sustain long-term survival and competitive advantage through effective environmental practices (Epstein and Roy, 2000). This may be achieved if companies seek beyond legislative compliance through voluntary actions to resolve environmental problems. Implementation of such environmental practices requires various <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> to be undertaken. The {{impacts on the}} environment vary between industries, so companies have their own specific problems to address, thus also their own specific environmental challenge. In order to achieve enhanced environmental performance and competitive advantage, the company’s position in managing environmental issues has {{to be based on}} the context of the particular environmental challenge of the company (Reinhardt, 1999). Furthermore, it is assumed that a company’s level of environmental performance is proportional to how well <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> are undertaken to correlate with the environmental challenge. The pharmaceutical industry has previously been known for voluntary actions in terms of environmental practices, but some researchers proclaim the opposite (Blum-Kusterer and Hussain, 2001). For this reason, the purpose of this study is to map out the phenomenon of <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> in the context of the Swedish pharmaceutical industry. This study’s main finding was that not much has changed over the last 18 years since the latest survey regarding <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> in industry (Baumann and Bjerndell, 1990). The pharmaceutical industry is focused on managing environmental problems of today through pollution prevention strategies. <b>Environmental</b> <b>investments</b> are undertaken in resemblance with TQM thinking - preventing mistakes saves costs (Bring Procopé and Axelsson, 2003). In this study, different perspectives in environmental management literature have been applied to develop an analytical framework. The framework was used to investigate, and compare the environmental work of three pharmaceutical companies: AstraZeneca, Recip, and Pfizer. Empirical data has mainly been gathered from the companies’ publicly available environmental reports, but also from interviews with environmental representatives of the companies...|$|R

40|$|DOI: [URL] This paper aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between social and <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> and the inclusion of companies in the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA, by applying logistic regression. For this, we analyzed information relating to internal and external social and <b>environmental</b> <b>investments,</b> from the social balance of companies. The sample consisted of companies eligible {{for inclusion in the}} portfolio ISE in the period of December 2009 to December 2010. According to the results, we can conclude that there is a relationship between <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> and entry of firms in the portfolio ISE of BM&FBOVESPA, showing that investment made and evidenced in social and environmental issues is a sign of real commitment to social responsibility and sustainability and not simply a form of accountability of the funds invested. As the variables used, internal social investment (II), External (IE) and environmental (IA), we found that IE is the best proxy to explain this relationship. In other words, the results suggest that companies that invest resources in favor of community, either voluntarily or through taxes, which is or should be a resource applied in society, has more chances of entering the ISE portfolio composition...|$|R

We show that increases in <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> when councils are present could be employee-led, firm-led, or jointly-led. We test these alternatives with German panel data using a random effects probit model, and find a strong and robust relationship between investments in improving local environmental quality and council activities. This effect is largest when the council is active in environmental matters. With the exception of product innovation, we generally do not find analogous effects on <b>investments</b> that reduce <b>environmental</b> impacts more remote from the workplace, or for other types of investment. We conclude that the higher <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> in establishments with councils are largely employee-led or jointly-led...|$|R

Companies announcing membership in Climate Leaders and Ceres - two voluntary environmental programs related {{to climate change}} - experience significantly negative abnormal stock returns. The price decline is smaller in carbon-intensive industries, where regulatory actions are more likely, and for high book-to-market firms, suggesting that "green" expenditures crowd out growth-related investments. We also document insignificant announcement returns for portfolios of industry rivals. Overall, the <b>environmental</b> <b>investments</b> appear to conflict with shareholder value-maximization. This has far reaching implications since the U.
