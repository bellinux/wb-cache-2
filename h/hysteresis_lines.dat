40|$|This final {{technical}} report describes work performed under DOE Grant No. DE-FG 26 - 97 FT 97278 during the period October 01, 1997 to August 31, 2001 which covers the total performance period of the project. During this period, detailed information on optimal salinity, temperature, emulsion morphologies, effectiveness for surfactant retention and oil recovery was obtained for an Alcohol Ethoxycarboxylate (AEC) surfactant to evaluate its performance in flooding processes. Tests were conducted on several AEC surfactants and NEODOX (23 - 4) was identified as the most suitable hybrid surfactant that yielded the best proportion in volume for top, middle, and bottom phases when mixed with oil and water. Following the selection of this surfactant, temperature and salinity scans were performed to identify the optimal salinity and temperature, and the temperature and salinity intervals in which all three phases coexisted. NEODOX 23 - 4 formed three phases between 4 and 52. 5 C. It formed an aqueous rich microemulsion phase at high temperatures and an oleic rich microemulsion phase at low temperatures [...] a characteristic of the ionic part of the surfactant. The morphology measurement system was set-up successfully at CAU. The best oil/water/surfactant system defined by the above phase work was then studied for emulsion morphologies. Electrical conductivities were measured for middle and bottom phases of the NEODOX 23 - 4 /dodecane/ 10 mM water system and by mixing measured volumes of the middle phase into a fixed volume of the bottom phase and vice versa at room temperature. Electrical conductivity of the mixture decreased as the fraction of volume of the middle phase was increased and vice versa. Also inversion phenomena was observed. These experiments were then repeated for bottom/middle (B/M) and middle/bottom (M/B) conjugate pair phases at 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 C. Electrical conductivity measurements were then compared with the predictions of the conductivity model developed in this project. The M/B and B/M morphologies and their inversion <b>hysteresis</b> <b>lines</b> conformed to the previously postulated dispersion morphology diagram; that is, within experimental uncertainties, the two emulsion inversion lines in phase volume-temperature space met at a critical point that coincided with the upper critical end point for the phases. Coreflooding measurements were performed by our industrial partner in this project, Surtek, Golden, CO which showed poor hydrocarbon recovery (38. 1 %) for NEODOX 23 - 4. It was also found that NEODOX 23 - 4 surfactant adsorbed too much to the rock (97. 1 % surfactant loss to the core), a characteristic of the non-ionic part of the surfactant...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the real-time current response of strongly-correlated quantum dot systems under sinusoidal driving voltages. By {{means of an}} accurate hierarchical equations of motion approach, we demonstrate the presence of prominent memory effects induced by the Kondo resonance on the real-time current response. These memory effects appear as distinctive <b>hysteresis</b> <b>line</b> shapes and self-crossing features in the dynamic current-voltage characteristics, with concomitant excitation of odd-number overtones. They emerge as a cooperative effect of quantum coherence - due to inductive behavior - and electron correlations - due to the Kondo resonance. We also show the suppression of memory effects and the transition to classical behavior {{as a function of}} temperature. All these phenomena can be observed in experiments and may lead to novel quantum memory applications. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of an oscillated sessile drop of incompressible liquid with {{the focus on}} the contact <b>line</b> <b>hysteresis</b> is under theoretical consideration. The solid substrate is subject to transverse oscillations, which are assumed small amplitude and high frequency. The dynamic boundary condition that involves an ambiguous dependence of the contact angle on the contact line velocity is applied: the contact line starts to move only when the deviation of the contact angle exceeds a certain critical value. As a result, the stick-slip dynamics can be observed. The frequency response of surface oscillations on the substrate and at the pole of the drop are analyzed. It is shown that novel features such as the emergence of antiresonant frequency bands and nontrivial competition of different resonances are caused by contact <b>line</b> <b>hysteresis.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{fundamental}} concepts and the terminology of wetting. In particular, {{it focuses on}} high temperature wetting phenomena of primary interest to materials scientists. We have chosen to split this review into two sections: one related to macroscopic (continuum) definitions {{and the other to}} a microscopic (or atomistic) approach, where the role of chemistry and structure of interfaces and free surfaces on wetting phenomena are addressed. A great deal of attention has been placed on thermodynamics. This allows clarification of many important features, including the state of equilibrium between phases, the kinetics of equilibration, triple <b>lines,</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> adsorption (segregation) and the concept of complexions, intergranular films, prewetting, bulk phase transitions versus “interface transitions”, liquid versus solid wetting, and wetting versus dewetting.

40|$|As digital {{microfluidics}} {{has continued}} to mature since its advent in the early 19802 ̆ 7 s, an increase in new and novel applications of this technology have been developed. However, even as this technology has become more common place, a consensus on the physics and force models of {{the motion of the}} contact line between the fluid, substrate, and ambient has not been reached. This uncertainty along with the dependence of the droplet geometry on the force to cause its motion has directed much of the research at specific geometries and droplet actuation methods. The goal of this thesis is to help characterize the components of the friction force which opposes droplet motion as a one dimensional system model based upon simple system parameters independent from the actuation method. To this end, the force opposing the motion of a droplet under a thin rectangular glass cover slip was measured for varying cover slip dimensions (widths, length), gap height between the cover slip and substrate, and bulk droplet velocity. The stiffness of the droplet before droplet motion began, the force at which the motion initiated, and the steady-state force opposing the droplet motion were measured. The data was then correlated to hypothesized equations and compared to simple models accounting for the forces due to the contact angle <b>hysteresis,</b> contact <b>line</b> friction, and viscous losses. It was found that the stiffness, breakaway force, and steady-state force of the droplet could be correlated to with an error standard deviation of 8...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} {{confined in}} a quantum dot interacts with its local nuclear spin environment through the hyperfine contact interaction. This interaction combined with external control and relaxation or {{measurement of the}} electron spin allows for the generation of dynamic nuclear polarization. The quantum nature of the nuclear bath, along with the interplay of coherent external fields and incoherent dynamics in these systems renders a wealth of intriguing phenomena seen in recent experiments such as electron Zeeman frequency focusing, <b>hysteresis,</b> and <b>line</b> dragging. We develop in detail a fully quantum, self-consistent theory {{that can be applied}} to such experiments and that moreover has predictive power. Our theory uses the operator sum representation formalism in order to incorporate the incoherent dynamics caused by the additional, Markovian bath, which in self-assembled dots is the vacuum field responsible for electron-hole optical recombination. The beauty of this formalism is that it reduces the complexity of the problem by encoding the joint dynamics of the external coherent and incoherent driving in an effective dynamical map that only acts on the electron spin subspace. This together with the separation of timescales in the problem allows for a tractable and analytically solvable formalism. The key role of entanglement between the electron spin and the nuclear spins in the formation of dynamic nuclear polarization naturally follows from our solution. We demonstrate the theory in detail for an optical pulsed experiment and present an in-depth discussion and physical explanation of our results.

40|$|Many multiphase-flows {{are governed}} by {{capillarity}} and wettability such as spray painting and ink-jet printing applications, cooling devices of small scaled microchips and inside internal combustion engines referring to the fuel injection. The contact angle is a decisive parameter when such a system is analyzed. If the contact angle is in the bounds of the <b>hysteresis,</b> the contact <b>line</b> is pinned (immobile). An accurate numerical simulation is not trivial because of the contact line singularity, a good measure of the contact line velocity {{as well as the}} realization of pinning. In this study, the implementation of the dynamic contact angle is extended, accounting for contact line pinning as well as the dynamic behavior in the advancing and receding phase. In short, the whole contact angle hysteresis is realized. The implementation has been validated by considering the cases of a drop impact on a horizontal surface, the simulation of drops on inclined surfaces and drops exposed to a shear flow. Moreover, the wetting of geometrically complex surfaces has been investigated and an approach for the modeling of the geometrical influence on a flat wall by a boundary condition is presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{the nuclear}} fusion plasmas, both of thermal energy and {{particle}} transports governed by turbulent flow are anomalously enhanced more than neoclassical levels. Thus, to clarify {{a relationship between}} the turbulent flow and the anomalous transports has been the most worthwhile work. There are experimental results that the turbulent flow induces various phenomena on transport processes such as non-linearity, transition, hysteresis, multi-branches and non-locality. We are approaching these complicated problems by analyzing not conventional power balance but these phenomena directly. They are recognized as dynamical trajectories in the flux and gradient space and must be a clue to comprehend a physical mechanism of arcane anomalous transport. Especially, to elucidate the mechanism for electron thermal energy transport is critical in the fusion plasma researches because the burning plasmas will be sustained by alpha-particle heating. In large helical device, the dynamical relationships between electron thermal energy fluxes and electron temperature gradients are investigated by using modulated electron cyclotron resonance heating and modern electron cyclotron emission diagnostic systems. Some trajectories such as <b>hysteresis</b> loop or <b>line</b> segments with steep slope which represent non-linear property are observed in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|In part 1 (Gouin, [13]), we {{proposed}} a model of dynamics of wetting for slow movements near a contact line formed at the interface of two immiscible fluids and a solid when viscous dissipation remains bounded. The contact line is not a material line and a Young-Dupré equation for the apparent dynamic contact angle {{taking into account the}} line celerity was proposed. In this paper we consider a form of the interfacial energy of a solid surface in which many small oscillations are superposed on a slowly varying function. For a capillary tube, a scaling analysis of the microscopic law associated with the Young-Dupré dynamic equation yields a macroscopic equation for the motion of the contact line. The value of the deduced apparent dynamic contact angle yields for the average response of the line motion a phenomenon akin to the stick-slip motion of the contact line on the solid wall. The contact angle hysteresis phenomenon and the modelling of experimentally well-known results expressing the dependence of the apparent dynamic contact angle on the celerity of the line are obtained. Furthermore, a qualitative explanation of the maximum speed of wetting (and dewetting) can be given. Key words: contact angle, contact <b>line,</b> <b>hysteresis.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper we report the effects of surface roughness on contact line friction coefficients of water droplets on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces. Both advancing and receding contact line friction coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier (with micropillars), and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on micropillars) surfaces {{over a wide range}} of contact line velocities and droplet volumes. Our results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with CNTs on top of micropillars can significantly decrease both the advancing and receding contact line friction coefficients. In comparison, both the advancing and receding contact line friction coefficients on smooth surfaces were more than ten times larger than those on superhydrophobic surfaces. However, droplets on one-tier surfaces with only micropillars exhibit different dynamic behaviors on advancing and receding movements. We experimentally investigated the Wenzel-Cassie transition on micropillar structures and found that the receding motion on micropillars is dominated by the Wenzel behavior, which leads to higher receding contact line friction coefficients on one-tier surfaces. However, there is a high tendency for an advancing droplet to exhibit Cassie-type behaviors on one-tier surfaces. As a result, advancing contact line friction coefficient is considerably mitigated on micropillars. On two-tier superhydrophobic surfaces, it was the Cassie–Baxter behavior that dominates both the advancing and receding contact line motions giving rise to less friction coefficients. Furthermore, the effects of surface roughness on contact <b>line</b> <b>hysteresis</b> are discussed in this paper. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Non-wetting liquid slug motions in an axially {{oscillating}} horizontal circular tube are studied. We {{investigate the}} oscillatory dynamic contact lines that constitute an edge boundary condition for liquid interfacial flow with solid boundaries. To induce oscillatory {{motion of the}} liquid slug, the tube is oscillated horizontally along its axis where surface tension and inertia are dominant. Based on the observations, an oscillatory contact line model that considers the unsteady effect is proposed. When the slug acceleration is not large, the meniscus is always a spherical cap and the slug motion can be approximated by an ordinary differential equation in time (a zero dimensional simulation). For sufficiently slow motion, the model approaches Dussan’s (1979) unidirectional steady contact line model. For minimal contact line stick, commonly called contact angle <b>hysteresis,</b> the contact <b>line</b> motion versus contact angle polar plot obtained from both experiments and simulation have elliptical trajectories. When the slug coats the tube with a macro-scale liquid layer for larger forcing velocities, the contact line relation is similar to earlier experiments by Ting & Perlin (1995). This relationship follows the standard definition of hysteresis in that the contact angle depends on the time history of 2 the contact line velocity, whether or not stick occurs. The model predictions agree qualitatively with the experiments. When the tube oscillation is asymmetric directionally (e. g. a truncated periodic t 2 function), a net slug displacement relative to the tube is generated. The pumping effect has potential applications for fluid handling in microgravity or the control of small liquid drops in earth based labs. 1...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the {{modeling and simulation}} of a parallel-plate Electrowetting On Dielectric (EWOD) device that moves fluid droplets through surface tension effects. The fluid dynamics are modeled by Hele-Shaw type equations {{with a focus on}} including the relevant boundary phenomena. Specifically, we include contact angle saturation, <b>hysteresis,</b> and contact <b>line</b> pinning into our model. We show that these extra boundary effects are needed to make reasonable predictions of the correct shape and time scale of droplet motion. We compare our simulation to experimental data for five different cases of droplet motion that include splitting and joining of droplets. Without these boundary effects, the simulation predicts droplet motion that is much faster than in experiment (up to 10 - 20 times faster). We present two different numerical implementations of our model. The first uses a level set method, and the second uses a variational method. The level set method provides a straightforward way of simulating droplet motion with topological changes. However, the variational method was pursued for its robust handling of curvature and mass conservation, in addition to being able to easily include a phenomenological model of contact line pinning using a variational inequality. We are also able to show that the variational form of the time-discrete model satisfies a well-posedness result. Our numerical implementations are fast and are being used to design algorithms for the precise control of micro-droplet motion, mixing, and splitting. We demonstrate micro-fluidic control by developing an algorithm to steer individual particles inside the EWOD system by control of actuators already present in the system. Particles are steered by creating time-varying flow fields that carry the particles along their desired trajectories. Results are demonstrated using the model given above. We show that the current EWOD system at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) contains enough control authority to steer a single particle along arbitrary trajectories and to steer two particles, at once, along simple paths. We also show that particle steering is limited by contact angle saturation and by the small number of actuators available in the EWOD system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 11, 2014 - July 11, 2015 A microchannel-based hemodialyzer offers a novel approach to hemodialysis practice and holds many promises for improving dialysis treatment efficiency {{and quality of life}} for kidney patients. The hollow fiber hemodialyzer, a conventional dialysis device, has certain limitations including non-uniformity of the dialysate flow path which necessitates the use of a high dialysate flow rate. In the microchannel-based design, successive stacked layers alternate between blood flow and dialysate flow. A flat porous membrane between these layers allows for the transport of toxins from the blood side to the dialysis fluid side. This design improves mass transfer characteristics and enables the use of lower dialysate to blood flow rate ratios suitable for a home hemodialysis system. One of the current issues in microchannel dialyzer is the emergence of bubbles through blood-outgassing and air ingress. This dissertation provides an in depth study of the bubble pinning phenomenon and the impact of the geometrical design of a single lamina of the microchannel dialyzer on bubble removal. Our primary method to facilitate bubble mitigation in the system is increasing the surface hydrophilicity by applying polyethylene oxide (PEO) coating on internal surface of polycarbonate laminas. The effects of contact angle <b>hysteresis</b> and contact <b>line</b> (pinning) forces as well as the dewetting velocity on bubble stagnation have been studied. A theoretical model that estimates the required pressure drop along the length of a stagnant bubble to overcome pinning forces to stimulate motion has been developed. The model has been validated by experimental results. The model demonstrates that the use of highly hydrophilic surfaces is a robust approach to reducing both pinning and capillary forces and subsequently bubble clogging in microfluidic systems. The geometrical design must exhibit low resistance for bubble mitigation while maintaining a relatively uniform flow distribution between channels for efficient mass transfer. A single lamina of the microchannel dialyzer under development at OSU is comprised of an inlet manifold, an outlet manifold and a parallel microchannel array; the manifolds feature a micropost arrangement that supports the membrane. The overall manifold geometry was designed for uniform flow distribution while the suggested arrangement of microposts inside the manifolds was aimed at exhibiting low bubble retention. For all the experiments in this dissertation, water has been used as the working fluid; however, for the selection of the microchannel size and velocity conditions, considerations for preventing blood hemolysis under shear stress were taken into account. Furthermore, the anticipated differences between an air-water system and an air-blood system have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes research performed using siloxane polymers. This {{includes the}} reactions of siloxane polymers with inorganic oxide surfaces to form covalently attached monolayers, and the electrical properties of crosslinked silicone composite films fabricated by compounding with nickel particles. In addition to these topics, the use of contact line pinning as a practical and controllable method for the deposition of materials on superhydrophobic and chemically patterned surfaces is also described The first chapter provides a general review of siloxane polymer chemistry, focusing in particular {{on the relationship between}} molecular structure and physical properties. The use and fabrication of silicone composite materials is also discussed, including typical methods for crosslinking siloxane polymers and the effects of filler materials. Finally, contact angle <b>hysteresis</b> and contact <b>line</b> pinning phenomena are presented. Following this introduction, four separate but interrelated projects are presented. First, the surface modification of titania via hydridomethylsiloxanes is discussed. This work represents an extension of the reaction of hydridosilanes and provides an environmentally clean method for the hydrophobization of titania. Linear and cyclic hydridomethylsiloxanes, as well as hydridomethylsiloxane-co-dimethylsiloxane polymers, are used as reagents and the resulting surfaces are discussed. Unpredicted results from this method lead to the consideration of poly(dimethylsiloxane) as a previously unconsidered reagent presented in the next project. The second project discusses the covalent attachment of siloxane polymers, particularly poly(dimethylsiloxane), to a range of inorganic oxide surfaces, including titania, nickel oxide, alumina, and silica. This reaction is presented as a thermally activated equilibrium process, and offers insight into certain aging processes found in silicone materials. Particular focus is made on the development of a highly reproducible method for the fabrication of low contact angle hysteresis surfaces. Furthermore, this reaction is shown to be general for the siloxane bond through the reaction of functional and cyclic siloxanes. The third project describes the preparation of electrically conductive silicone coatings, containing nickel and titania particles. The effect of nickel concentration and geometry on the electrical properties of these coatings is examined and the effects on the percolation threshold are presented. In addition to this, the addition of titania nanoparticles to diminish electrical conductance is also investigated. The fourth project discusses the contact line pinning of liquids on hydrophobic surfaces. In this chapter, the use of ionic liquids exhibiting no vapor pressure is used to experimentally determine the de-wetting process of liquids from pillared, superhydrophobic surfaces through micro-capillary bridge rupture. Furthermore, this technique is used as a preparative technique for the fabrication of individual salt crystals supported on pillared surfaces...|$|R
