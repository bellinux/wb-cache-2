60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Geraldine Conyers, who {{had been}} {{watching}} him with interest. Lady Anselman at once introduced them.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Bulan stood {{watching}} the retreating savages, a smile upon his lips, {{and then as}} the sudden equatorial dawn burst forth <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "You boys let up {{with this}} nonsense," [...] came sternly from Tom Rover. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> one of his twins. [...] "Randy, I ought {{to give you a}} {{thrashing}} for wetting me like this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ace Palmero (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) - Local news {{reporter}} of Pleasant Hills, he always refers {{to himself as}} [...] "I, Ace Palmero". A recurring gag involves only his profile being shown on TV with the camera changing whenever <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> it. First appeared: [...] "Skate Gate". Last appeared: [...] "Truth or Daring".|$|R
60|$|Johnson, Redbrook, and {{the others}} return, rather mistrustfully {{ushering}} in Sidi el Assif, attended by Osman and a troop of Arabs. Brassbound's men keep together on the archway side, backing their captain. Sidi's followers cross the room behind the table and assemble near Sir Howard, who stands his ground. Drinkwater runs across to Brassbound and stands at his elbow as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Sidi.|$|R
60|$|The {{receiver}} {{slipped from}} his nerveless fingers. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> around <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Wingate, crouching over the table, his arms resting upon it, his eyes blood-shot, {{a slave to}} abject fear.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door upon them, and sighed supreme relief. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Hortensia, and a smile broke like {{sunshine}} upon his face, and dispelled the serious gloom of his expression. She sprang towards him.|$|E
60|$|But for {{his very}} low voice, his slow {{speaking}} of the words, Shefford would have thought him a white man. For Shefford there was indeed an instinct in this meeting, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the Navajo.|$|E
60|$|The boy stood {{upon the}} bed as before and, {{reaching}} up, closed the opening {{so that no}} one else could discover it. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his visitor, but the Slave of the Royal Bedstead had disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|In a post-credits scene set {{six months}} later, Chucky, {{still in his}} doll body, is {{delivered}} to the now-adult Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), apparently having failed to possess Alice's body. When Andy <b>turns</b> his back <b>to</b> answer {{a phone call from}} his mother, Chucky cuts {{his way out of the}} package with a knife. However, after Chucky looks at a picture of Kyle and Andy with his mother, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Andy, who had anticipated Chucky coming after him again and is now pointing a shotgun at Chucky's head. Andy says firmly, [...] "Play with this!" [...] right before pulling the trigger.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> {{sideways}} <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the bishop. [...] "I {{think we}} should be coming if--if it wasn't for old entangled difficulties. I don't know if you will mind my saying it to you, but...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I will," [...] he said abruptly, and {{thrusting}} {{the glove}} back <b>to</b> her <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> leave. <b>Facing</b> round, however, he said, [...] "Tess, as God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} professor, [...] "let us {{return to the}} long-house. I wish {{to have a few}} words in private with you, von Horn," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his assistant, but the man had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|At first Lydie {{only saw}} Gaston as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the intruders. His face was flushed, and he muttered a quickly-suppressed oath. But already she had guessed, even before Lady Eglinton's strident voice had set her every nerve a-tingling.|$|E
60|$|Kenton {{leaned against}} a tree, his face hidden in his arm, and we three stood gazing at him in silence and astonishment until perhaps ten minutes had passed, when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> us with an {{expression}} such as I shall never forget.|$|E
5000|$|... When Apollo reveals {{himself to}} Achilles, the Trojans have retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels {{the shame of}} the rout and {{resolves}} <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Achilles, despite the pleas of his parents, Priam and Hecuba. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him into stopping, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his opponent. After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck. Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he, too, is fated {{to die in the}} war. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it.|$|R
60|$|And so saying <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> {{the wall}} and gave up the ghost.|$|R
50|$|Another example {{involves}} a chimpanzee that was approached from behind by a loud aggressive rival. Here, the chimpanzee moved his lips until {{he lost his}} fear grin thereby concealing his fear. Only then did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> around <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the challenger.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> ahead. The {{stallion}} stretched low on a dead run; {{the tips}} of the pines were bending before the wind; and Wildfire, the terrible thing for which his horse was named, was leaping through the forest. But there was no sound.|$|E
60|$|An hysterical cry, choked and subdued, {{broke from}} her lips. He half carried, half {{led her to}} his easy-chair. Suddenly steadied by the {{presence}} of this unlooked-for emergency, he closed the outside door and relit the lamp with firm fingers. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> her, and his amazement at this strange visit became consternation.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy is a liar, and, what is more, {{has just}} robbed his uncle's store, if {{what they say}} over at the Run be true," [...] the fakir said, excitedly, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the crowd. [...] "I don't want to hurt him; but I won't be insulted by a thief, so {{the best thing for}} me to do is to leave." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> {{the wall}} {{and for a while}} was silent. Then he spoke again.|$|R
60|$|Verrall's fingers {{played on}} the cloth for a space. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> me again.|$|R
2500|$|Another example {{involves}} a chimpanzee that was approached from behind by a loud aggressive rival. Here, the chimpanzee moved his lips until {{he lost his}} [...] fear grin thereby concealing his fear. Only then did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> around <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the challenger.|$|R
60|$|There he turned, winded, {{to await}} the {{oncoming}} foe. Here was a spot where a single man might defy an army, and Bulan had been quick to see the natural advantages of it. He placed the girl upon her feet behind a protruding shoulder of the canyon's wall which rose to a considerable distance still above them. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the mob that was surging up the narrow pathway toward him.|$|E
6000|$|... "My misgivings are all for {{the time}} when this siege shall be ended; when you and I shall have gone each our {{separate}} way," [...] he answered boldly. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> her now, and his voice rang a little tense. [...] "But for being here to guide this fine resistance and lend you the little aid I can---- No, no, I have no misgiving for that. It is the dearest frolic ever my soldiering led me into. I came to Roccaleone with a message of warning; but underneath, deep down in my heart, I bore the hope that mine should {{be more than a}} messenger's part; that mine it might be to remain by you and do such work as I am doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the door}} opened, therefore, the lord Cornbury rose, and, {{determined}} {{to bring the}} interview to a speedy issue, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the individual who entered, with a mien, into which he threw all the distance and hauteur that he thought necessary for such an object. But he encountered, in the mariner of the India-shawl, a very different man from the flattering and obsequious grocer who had just quitted him. Eye met eye; his gaze of authority receiving a look as steady, if not as curious, as his own. It was evident, by the composure of the fine manly frame he saw, that its owner rested his claims on the aristocracy of nature. The noble forgot his acting {{under the influence of}} surprise, and his voice expressed as much of admiration as command when he said-- ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Angel" [...] {{features}} Daddy G {{in a car}} park. He is walking to the exit when Robert del Naja, Andrew Vowles and Horace Andy appear behind Marshall. They gradually get closer to Marshall, causing him to feel intimidated. More people start following him, which causes him to run outside the car park until he reaches a fence and therefore cannot go any further. As <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the people chasing him, they stop and face him. He then notices {{that they seem to}} be mirroring his movements, as if his body controls them. He suddenly charges towards the people that followed him, which causes them to run away.|$|R
5000|$|In one memorable scene, Groucho Marx {{said into}} a telephone, [...] "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" [...] <b>He</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> {{the camera and}} said to the audience, [...] "Well, all the jokes can't be good, you have to expect that once in a while." ...|$|R
60|$|As evening fell a gray shade {{gathered}} round Bobby's mouth, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the tent-wall wearily. The Surgeon-Major frowned.|$|R
60|$|He {{was in an}} {{enthusiastic}} mood. He seemed to see his way to living comfortably in Christminster {{in the course of}} a year or two, and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much. He might, of course, have gone there now, in some capacity or other, but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present. A warm self-content suffused him when he considered what he had already done. Now and then as he went along <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the peeps of country on either side of him. But he hardly saw them; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied; and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far.|$|E
60|$|Jake, to Dick's relief, {{did as he}} was told, {{but next}} moment another man ran out of the arch, and {{somebody}} in the darkness called out in Castilian. Dick thought he knew the voice; but the men were behind him now, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them. The nearest had his hand at his ragged sash, and Dick saw that he must act before the long Spanish knife came out. He struck hard, leaning forward as he did so, and the man reeled back; but the other two closed with him, and although his knuckles jarred as a second blow got home, he felt a stinging pain high up in his side. His breathing suddenly got difficult, but as he staggered towards the wall he saw Jake dash his soft hat in the face of another antagonist and spring upon the fellow. There seemed to be four men round them and one was like Oliva, the contractor; but Dick's sight was going and he had a fit of coughing that was horribly painful.|$|E
6000|$|... "A good reason, indeed," [...] said Ralph, [...] "and one {{of which}} I admit the weight," [...] and he drew {{to one side of}} the path as though to let Piet pass, which he began to do holding the muzzle of the gun in a line with the other's head. Ralph sat upon his horse staring moodily at the ground, as though he was trying to make up his mind to say {{something}} or other, but all the time he was watching out of the corner of his quick eye. Just as Swart Piet drew past him, and was shaking the reins to put his horse to a canter, Ralph slid from the saddle, and springing upon him like light, he slipped his strong arm round him and dragged him backwards to the ground over the crupper of the horse. As Piet fell he stretched out his hands to grip the saddle and save himself, so that the gun which he carried resting on his knees dropped upon the grass. Ralph seized it and fired it into the air; then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his enemy, who by this time had found his feet.|$|E
60|$|It was {{something}} in that voice, a muffled note of exultation, that awoke suspicion in him, and made whole the half-doubt he had been entertaining. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> sharply <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Don Diego, so sharply that the sly smile was not effaced from the Spaniard's countenance before Captain Blood's eyes had flashed upon it.|$|R
50|$|Beavis and Butt-Head {{are working}} at Burger World when the latter {{returns from the}} {{bathroom}} and realizes {{that he has been}} paid to defecate. Beavis finds this to be a genius discovery, and joins him in the bathroom, while the queue to be served grows longer and longer. The manager is upset and drags them out of the bathroom. However, a labor lawyer in the queue tells the manager that it is illegal to limit his employees' bathroom break. Beavis and Butt-Head return to slack off in the bathroom, and the manager has to serve the impatient queue. The manager leaves the restaurant and hides behind a secluded wall to urinate, but the police park right next to him and arrest him for public urination. As <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them without doing up his zipper, he is also charged with indecent exposure.|$|R
50|$|Handa {{launches}} a diversion as Koichi, Midori and Soichiro storm {{the plane and}} kill most of the splinter faction, but before they can fully secure the plane, Fujiwara orders the pilot to takeoff. Koichi, Midori and Soichiro force the plane down by shooting the engines. The plane crash-lands on a landfill on Showa Island and Fujiwara makes his escape. Koichi and Soichiro are in a daze from the crash, but Midori climbs up on the fuselage and begins setting up her Mauser C96 pistol for long-range shooting. Handa {{and the rest of}} the Kerberos unit scramble to the crash site, but are beaten by the Self-Police. Fujiwara meets a wall of Self-Police in riot gear, waiting to apprehend him, but instead of resisting arrest, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the distant crashed plane and Midori, who shoots him between the eyes.|$|R
