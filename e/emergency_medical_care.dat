5|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> {{applies to}} other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction.

5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the risk {{perceptions}} and attitudes of healthcare personnel, especially of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> personnel, regarding the possibility of an outbreak or epidemic event. This study was designed to investigate pre-event knowledge and attitudes of a national sample of the <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> providers in relation to a potential human influenza pandemic, and to determine predictors of these attitudes. Surveys were distributed to a random, cross-sectional sample of 20 % of the Australian <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> workforce (n = 2, 929), stratified by the nine services operating in Australia, as well as by gender and location. The surveys included: (1) demographic information; (2) knowledge of influenza; and (3) attitudes and perceptions related to working during influenza pandemic conditions. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of pandemic-related risk perceptions. Among the 725 Australian <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> personnel who responded, 89 % were very anxious about working during pandemic conditions, and 85 % perceived a high personal risk associated with working in such conditions. In general, respondents demonstrated poor knowledge in relation to avian influenza, influenza generally, and infection transmission methods. Less than 5 % of respondents perceived that they had adequate education/training about avian influenza. Logistic regression analyses indicate that, in managing the attitudes and risk perceptions of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> staff, particular attention should be directed toward the paid, male workforce (as opposed to volunteers), and on personnel whose relationship partners do not work in the health industry. These results highlight the potentially crucial role of education and training in pandemic preparedness. Organizations that provide <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> must address this apparent lack of knowledge regarding infection transmission, and procedures for protection and decontamination. Careful management of the perceptions of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> personnel during a pandemic is likely to be critical in achieving an effective response to a widespread outbreak of infectious disease...|$|R

5|$|One way {{to advance}} <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> is {{to obtain the}} {{recognition}} of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone loses its signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> {{providers}} are frontline health workers during emergencies.

[...] - [...] - Methods: Using a reply-paid postal questionnaire, the knowledge and attitudes of a national, stratified, random sample of the Australian <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> workforce in relation to pandemic influenza were investigated. In addition to knowledge and attitudes, there were five measures of anticipated behavior during pandemic conditions: (1) preparedness to wear personal protective equipment (PPE); (2) preparedness to change role; (3) willingness to work; and likely refusal to work with colleagues who were exposed to (4) known and (5) suspected influenza.
