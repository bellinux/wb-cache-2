50|$|Practicing {{instrument}} approaches {{can be done}} {{either in}} the instrument meteorological conditions or in visual meteorological conditions - in the latter case, a <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> is required so that the pilot practicing instrument approaches can wear a view-limiting device which restricts his field of view to the instrument panel. A <b>safety</b> <b>pilot's</b> primary duty is to observe and avoid other traffic.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that both pilots must agree prior to flight which pilot is the Pilot In Command (PIC). The designated Pilot In Command is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft and is liable for any mishaps. If the pilot operating the controls of the aircraft is designated the PIC, then the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> cannot log PIC time. If the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> is not the acting Pilot In Command, he can, however, log the time as Second-In-Command.|$|R

25|$|The Unmanned Little Bird demonstrator, which Boeing {{built from}} a {{civilian}} MD 530F, first flew on September 8, 2004, and {{made its first}} autonomous flight (with <b>safety</b> <b>pilot)</b> on October 16, 2004.|$|R
50|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> {{option is}} a very popular among general {{aviation}} pilots {{since it is the}} lesser expensive of the two options. Either pilot can potentially log the time as Pilot In Command (PIC) and an agreement of who is acting as Pilot In Command should be discussed before the flight occurs. The pilot wearing the foggles may log the time on the basis that he is rated in the airplane, and is the sole manipulator of the controls. The <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> can log PIC time only if he is the agreed upon acting Pilot In Command for the flight.|$|R

50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>Safety</b> Devices use lasers or {{cameras to}} sense a foreign {{object in the}} {{vicinity}} of the press brake. They are less obtrusive than other safety options, which means operators are less opposed to using them.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid this}} situation, a student pilot or a pilot under {{instruction}} uses a view limiting device to learn instrument flying proficiency {{under the supervision}} of a flight instructor. Instrument-rated pilots also use view-limiting devices supervised by an instructor or a <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> to practise instrument flight and maintain instrument flying proficiency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many safety-critical applications, battery perfor-mance is a {{significant}} limiting factor that affects the feasibility of <b>electronic</b> <b>safety</b> devices intended to alert workers to hazardous situations. In particular, battery capacity and lifetime are difficult to predict when safety devices are exposed to extremes of temperature, humidity, shock, and vibration that are common in construction, excavation, drill rigs, and mining work sites. Because battery failure is unacceptable in safety devices, periodic preventative maintenance is required, adding to device cost and labor cost and reducing acceptance of <b>electronic</b> <b>safety</b> devices. Energy harvesting and communications techniques based on passive UHF RFID technology may offer an alternative to battery power for some types of safety alert devices, particularly where hazardous conditions are created by powered heavy equipment. We present a worker safety device designed around a passiv...|$|R
25|$|The ULB Demonstrator first flew in the {{unmanned}} mode on June 30, 2006 {{from the}} United States Army's Yuma Proving Ground, flying a pre-programmed 20-minute armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission around the facility. All previous flights during the 450 flight hour engineering development phase had a <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> on board, although the aircraft was typically flown remotely from the ground.|$|R
50|$|When a pilot elects {{to train}} under the hood, two options are available. The {{first is to}} fly with a Certificated Flight Instructor - Instrument (CFII) who sits in the right seat and watches for aircraft, rising terrain, and other dangers. CFIIs {{typically}} charge between $30 and $60 per hour. The other option is to fly with a <b>safety</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|R

30|$|A further {{advantage}} of the electronic traction control is that the speed of applying and releasing the traction force can be adjusted. In addition to the <b>electronic</b> <b>safety</b> system, the unit is also provided with a mechanical traction limiting system and the patient can stop the switch which enables the patient to terminate the session.|$|R
50|$|There is {{currently}} no government regulation of ticket pricing, although {{the federal government}} retains jurisdiction over aircraft <b>safety,</b> <b>pilot</b> training, and accident investigations (through the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board).

5000|$|On 11 October 1988, USAF KC-135A, 60-0317, crashed at Wurtsmith Force Base after a {{hard landing}} {{following}} a steep approach in severe crosswind.

A fire erupted and killed all six crewmembers on board, while 10 passengers were able to jump to <b>safety.</b> <b>Pilot</b> error was determined as the cause of the accident.|$|R
50|$|Cameras {{are another}} <b>electronic</b> <b>safety</b> device used for press brake safety. The camera can detect an {{intrusion}} between {{the upper and}} lower dies. If an intrusion is detected, a signal will stop the downward movement of the ram. A camera safety system uses a linear scale to calculate the upper beam's position, velocity, and the stopping distance.|$|R
25|$|Olgay Özgür was the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> of the flight, a {{graduate}} of a flight school in Ankara, who flew the MD 80 for World Focus Airlines before joining Turkish Airlines and passing the 737 type rating; {{he was sitting in}} the cockpit's center jump seat.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} <b>electronic</b> formats for <b>safety</b> cases {{to meet the requirements}} of a number of military and civil standards. The challenge to safety engineers is to produce safety cases that are quickly readable, intelligible and auditable even when a large amount of material is required. We describe the problems in developing complex safety cases using traditional development methods and the opportunities to address these problems by the development of an <b>electronic</b> <b>safety</b> case. We then describe an example eSafety Case and how this can be used to manage a safety programme and to produce a safety case that will meet the requirements of the certification authorities. ...|$|R
