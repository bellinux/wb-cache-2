5000|$|Most IBM {{keypunch}} and verifiers used {{a common}} electrical/mechanical design in their keyboards to encode the mechanical keystrokes. As a key was depressed, a link on the keystem tripped a corresponding set of bails {{at the top}} of the keyboard assembly. The bails in turn made (closed) contacts to encode the characters electrically. As each key stroke was detected by the machine, a <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> energized a pair of magnets with a bail which restored the keystem mechanically, reset the bails performing the electrical encoding, and gave the [...] "feel" [...] and sound to the operator of a completed action. Each machine had a tendency to develop a [...] "feel" [...] of its own based on several variables such as the amount of wear, dirt,and clearance of the bail contacts within the keyboard, as well as factors in the base machine. The keyboards, however, had no provision for adjusting the [...] "feel" [...] other than the correct adjustment of the contacts on the restore bail contacts and the encoding bail contacts. Special function keys such as shift, release, duplication and others, had only electrical contacts under their stems, with no mechanical linkage to the bail assembly for encoding.|$|E

To improve the AC characteristics between 10 Hz and 100 kHz, a method is proposed to evaluate adjustments in the circuitry; {{increase of the}} amplification in the AC <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> and introduction of an external coaxial read-out shunt resistor.

40|$|Abstract—A continuous-time fourth-order equiripple linear phase filter with an {{automatic}} tuning circuit is presented. A high speed OTA based on the inverter structure is realized. The combined common-mode feedforward and common-mode <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> ensures the input and output common-mode stability. The gain performance could be maintained by combining an equivalent negative resistor circuit at the output nodes. Transcon-ductance tuning {{can be achieved by}} adjusting the bulk voltage by using the deep-NWELL technology. The modified automatic tuning circuit relaxes the speed requirement of the tuning blocks. Through the use of the operational transconductance amplifier as a building block with the automatic tuning scheme, the filter 3 dB cutoff frequency is 1 GHz with the group delay less than 4 % variation up to 1. 5 fc frequency. The 43 dB of IM 3 at filter cutoff frequency is obtained with 4 dbm two-tone signals. Implemented in 0. 18 - m CMOS process, the chip occupies 1 mm and consumes 175 mW at a 1. 5 -V supply voltage.

40|$|Abstract—A full CMOS seventh-order linear phase filter {{based on}} – biquads with a 3 -dB {{frequency}} of 200 MHz is real-ized in 0. 35 - m CMOS process. The linear operational transcon-ductance amplifier {{is based on}} complementary differential pairs {{in order to achieve}} both low-distortion figures and high-frequency operation. The common-mode feedback (CMFB) employed takes advantage of the filter architecture; incorporating the load capaci-tors into the CMFB loop improves further its phase margin. A very simple automatic tuning system corrects the filter deviations due to process parameter tolerances and temperature variations. The group delay ripple is less than 5 % for frequencies up to 300 MHz, while the power consumption is 60 mW.

40|$|Neural {{activity}} during development critically shapes postnatal wiring of the mammalian brain. This is best {{illustrated by the}} sensory systems, in which the patterned feed-forward excitation provided by sensory organs and experience drives the formation of mature topographic circuits capable of extracting specific features of sensory stimuli 1, 2. In contrast, {{little is known about}} the role of early activity in the development of the basal ganglia, a phylogenetically ancient group of nuclei fundamentally important for complex motor action and reward-based learning 3, 4. These nuclei lack direct sensory input and are only loosely topographically organized 5, 6, forming interlocking feed-forward and <b>feed-back</b> inhibitory <b>circuits</b> without laminar structure. Here we use transgenic mice and viral gene transfer methods to modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity in vivo in the developing striatum. We find that the balance of activity among the two inhibitory and antagonist pathways in the striatum regulates excitatory innervation of the basal ganglia during development. These effects indicate that the propagation of activity through a multi-stage network regulates the wiring of the basal ganglia, revealing an important role of positive feedback in driving network maturation...|$|R

We have achieved substantial progress on upgrading the high field (HF) EMR (W-band, 95 GHz) spectrometers that are especially advantageous for such studies. Particularly, we have built a new second W-band instrument (Mark II) in addition to our Mark I. Briefly, Mark II features: (i) an Oxford custom-built 7 T superconducting magnet which is scannable from 0 to 7 T at up to 0. 5 T/min; (ii) water-cooled coaxial solenoid with up to ± 550 G scan under digital (15 bits resolution) computer control; (iii) custom-engineered precision <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{which is used to}} drive this solenoid, is based on an Ultrastab 860 R sensor that has linearity better than 5 ppm and resolution of 0. 05 ppm; (iv) an Oxford CF 1200 cryostat for variable temperature studies from 1. 8 to 340 K.

40|$|The {{total amount}} of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) energy production in the global energy mix has been increasing strongly {{all over the world}} in the last decade. This phenomenon has been mainly driven by the promotion of renewable energies, {{as well as by the}} well known feed-in tariffs. Although the major part of PV installations consists in roof mounted panels in private, collective or commercial buildings, the amount of large scale PV power plants, from 200 kW to 10 MW or more is increasing drastically. Such large scale PV power plants already represent nearly 20 % of the total installed PV capacity. Indeed, by reducing of the overall system costs, they are becoming serious alternatives to fossil fuel or nuclear power plants for utilities. [GRAPHICS] Taking into account that a sun tracking system can substantially improve the daily energy production of flat plate modules (approx. 10 % to 50 %), and that such a tracking unit is absolutely necessary for concentrating photovoltaic systems (CPV), one understands its crucial role for solar power plants. One or two axis solar trackers already represent 27 % of the total power plant capacity worldwide in 2008. This part is increasing constantly since the additional investment costs for the mechanics are relatively inexpensive compared to PV. Especially for CPV systems, the control unit of a solar tracker has to provide reliable and precise positioning; hence controlling one or two drives to move the panels in a restricted angle window to the sun (typ. 1 degrees to 0. 1 degrees). In principle, such a positioning unit consists of a calculation unit (e. g. : mu C or DSP), a power unit driving the motors and a <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> for different kinds of sensors (e. g. : position or irradiance sensors). Consequently, integrating those functions into an already existing inverter, which feeds the PV power of one tracking unit (typ. 5 kW(p) to 40 kW(p)) into the grid, allows plenty of interesting advantages that will be pointed out in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} form of cancer among men in Europe and the US is {{prostate}} cancer. When a radical prostatectomy has been found necessary, it is of interest to examine the prostate, as tumour tissue on the capsule might indicate that the cancer has metastased. This is commonly done by a microscope-based morphometric investigation. Tumour tissue is normally stiffer than healthy tissue. Sensors based on piezoelectric resonance technology have been introduced into the medical field during the last decade. By studying the change in resonance frequency when a sensor comes into contact with a material, conclusions can be drawn about the material. A new and flexible measurement system using a piezoelectric resonance sensor has been evaluated. Three translation stages, two for horizontal movements and one for vertical movement, with stepper motors are controlled from a PC. A piezoelectric resonance element and a force sensor are integrated into a sensor head that is mounted on the vertical translation stage. The piezoelectric element is connected to a <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> and resonating at its resonance frequency until it comes into contact with a material, when a frequency shift can be observed. The force sensor is used to measure the applied force between the sensor and the material. These two parameters are combined into a third, called the stiffness parameter, which is important for stiffness evaluation. For measurements on objects with different geometries, the vertical translation stage can be aimed at a platform for flat objects or a fixture for spherical objects. The vertical translation stage is mounted on a manual rotational stage with which the contact angle between the sensor and the measured surface can be adjusted. The contact angles covered are between 0 ° and 35 ° from a line perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} measured object. The measured objects used were made from silicones of different stiffness and in the shape of flat discs and spheres. The indentation velocity of the sensor can be set at 1 mm/s to 5 mm/s. In the three papers that are the base for this licentiate thesis, we have investigated the dependence of the frequency shift, the applied force and the stiffness parameter on the contact angle, and the indentation velocity at different impression depths. The maximum error for the measurement system has also been determined. The results of the measurements indicate that great care must be taken when aiming the sensor against the surface of the point where the measurements are to be performed. Deviations in contact angle of more than iv± 10 ° from a line perpendicular to the surface will result in an underestimation of the frequency shift, meaning that the tissue will be regarded as stiffer than it really is. This result is important as the flat silicone models have a very even surface, which makes a controlled contact angle possible. Biological tissue can have a rough and uneven surface, which can lead to unintentional deviations in the contact angle. The magnitude of the stiffness parameter is favoured by a high indentation velocity compared to a low. The evaluation of this measurement system has shown that it is possible to distinguish between soft and stiff silicone models, which have been used in this initial phase of the study. A new feature in this measurement system is the fixture that makes measurements on spherical objects possible and the possibility to vary the angle of contact. This is promising for future studies and measurements on whole prostate in vitro. A future application for this measurement system is to aid surgeons performing radical prostatectomy in the search for tumour tissue on the capsule of the prostate, as the presence of tumour tissue can indicate that the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissue...|$|E
40|$|Members of the {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family play {{important roles}} in several neuronal functions. To understand the precise role of these channels in information processing, their presence on neuronal elements must be revealed. In this study, we investigated the localization of TRPC 6 channels in the adult hippocampal formation. Immunostainings with a specific antibody, which was validated in Trpc 6 knockout mice, showed that in the dentate gyrus, TRPC 6 channels are strongly expressed in granule cells. Immunogold staining revealing the subcellular localization of TRPC 6 channels clarified that these proteins were predominantly present on the membrane surface of the dendritic shafts of dentate granule cells, and also in their axons, often associated with intracellular membrane cisternae. In addition, TRPC 6 channels could be observed in the dendrites of some interneurons. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that TRPC 6 channels {{were present in the}} dendrites of hilar interneurons and hippocampal interneurons with horizontal dendrites in the stratum oriens expressing mGlu 1 a receptors, whereas parvalbumin immunoreactivity was revealed in TRPC 6 -expressing dendrites with radial appearance in the stratum radiatum. Electron microscopy showed that the immunogold particles depicting TRPC 6 channels were located on the surface membranes of the interneuron dendrites. Our results suggest that TRPC 6 channels are in a key position to alter the information entry into the trisynaptic loop of the hippocampal formation from the entorhinal cortex, and to control the function of both feed-forward and <b>feed-back</b> inhibitory <b>circuits</b> in this brain region...|$|R
40|$|Spasticity, a {{classical}} clinical manifestation of an upper motor neuron lesion, has been traditionally and physiologically {{defined as a}} velocity dependent increase in muscle tone caused by the increased excitability of the muscle stretch reflex. Clinically spasticity manifests as an increased resistance offered by muscles to passive stretching (lengthening) and {{is often associated with}} other commonly observed phenomenon like clasp-knife phenomenon, increased tendon reflexes, clonus and flexor and extensor spasms. The key to the increased excitability of the muscle stretch reflex (muscle tone) is the abnormal activity of muscle spindles which have an intricate relation with the innervations of the extrafusal muscle fibers at the spinal level (<b>feed-back</b> and feed-forward <b>circuits)</b> which are under influence of the supraspinal pathways (inhibitory and facilitatory). The reflex hyperexcitability develops over variable period of time following the primary lesion (brain or spinal cord) and involves adaptation in spinal neuronal circuitries caudal to the lesion. It is highly likely that in humans, reduction of spinal inhibitory mechanisms (in particular that of disynaptic reciprocal inhibition) is involved. While simply speaking the increased muscle stretch reflex may be assumed to be due to an altered balance between the innervations of intra and extrafusal fibers in a muscle caused by loss of inhibitory supraspinal control, the delayed onset after lesion and the frequent reduction in reflex excitability over time, suggest plastic changes in the central nervous system following brain or spinal lesion. It seems highly likely that multiple mechanisms are operative in causation of human spasticity, many of which still remain to be fully elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} stimulation of the ipsilateral DLF, caudal to a transection of the dorsal columns (at C 4), inhibits cells in the dorsal column nuclei. The presence of such inhibition was shown both by focal potential, and single unit, recording. It {{was found that the}} amplitude of a volley, conducted down the dorsal columns in response to a shock applied to the cuneate nucleus and recorded from the killed ends of dorsal column fibres at the rostral and of a transection of the dorsal columns, was increased by a preceding tetanus applied to the ipsilateral DLF. This evidence of depolarisation of dorsal column fibre terminals suggests that presynaptic inhibition contributes to the inhibition produced by DLF stimulation. A contribution from postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms was suggested by the observation, made on several occasions, that antidromic activation of a unit from the contralateral mid-brain could be prevented by a preceding shock applied to the ipsilateral DLF. In some oases inhibition of units was produced by squeezing {{one or more of the}} cat's paws; some of these units projected into the contralateral mid-brain. In addition to an inhibitory action from the ipsilateral DLF on the cells of the dorsal column nuclei, electrophysiological {{experiments have}} also demonstrated the presence of an excitatory action. The majority of the cells transynaptically activated stimulation of the DLF were found in the region andminus; 3 to + 2 andnbsp;mm (the obex being aero); however this may have been because the majority of electrode penetrations were also made in this region. Many of the unite so excited were shown to project into the contralateral mid-brain, thereby demonstrating the existence of a genuine excitatory effect on the dorsal column nuclei. Approximately one third of the units excited by stimulation of the DLF were also excited by peripheral mechanical stimulation. In the majority of cases the effective stimulus was cutaneous stimulation. A number of units, deep in the cuneate nucleus, ware found to be excited by "noxious" mechanical stimulation; no such units wore found in the gracile nucleus. Only one of those tested was found to project into the contralateral mid-brain, suggesting that these units may be inhibitory interneurones. The excitation and inhibition, produced by stimulation of the ipsilateral DLF, were abolished by transection of the DLF. They were net affected by transection of the brain stem at a level immediately rostral to the dorsal column nuclei. None of the cells transynaptically activated by stimulation of the DLF were also activated by stimulation of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum; this suggests that dorsal column nuclei cells were not excited by collaterals of direct spinocerebellar tract fibres. The presence of direct connections between the dorsal column nuclei and the DLF was demonstrated electrophysiologically by the recording, in the dorsal column nuclei, of short constant latency responses with properties indicative of external recordings from fibres. Whether such fibres were afferent to, or efferent from, the cells of the dorsal column nuclei could not be established from such recordings. However, evidence for the existence of both such categories was found. Some cells in the dorsal column nuclei were antidromically activated by stimulation of the ipsilateral DLF. Some of these cells were orthodromically activated by afferents coursing in the DLF. The presence of such orthodromic activation of those cells led to the speculation that the cells with descending projections may synapse, directly or indirectly, with the cells of origin of the afferent pathway, and thereby form a <b>feed-back</b> <b>circuit</b> within this system. Anatomical experiments have demonstrated the existence of direct afferent fibre connections between the DLF and the dorsal column nuclei. Terminal degeneration was found, after lesions of the DLF, in the rostral parts of both cuneate and gracile nuclei. The terminal degeneration extended from 1 andnbsp;mm caudal to the obex up to the rostral poles of both nuclei. Such anatomical evidence of a direct afferent pathway does not, of course, exclude the presence of indirect pathways; such pathways, if synapsing before reaching the dorsal column nuclei, would not be demonstrated by anatomical methods. It is not possible, from the results described, to determine whether the direct pathway is formed by collaterals from a tract already known, such as the spinocervical tract, or whether it exists as a separate entity. </p...|$|E
