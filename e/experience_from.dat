5|$|<b>Experience</b> <b>from</b> the few {{cities where}} {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City {{prepared}} for the final at Southport, Lancashire, at the Palace Hotel. The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On {{the day before the}} match travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the press about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered by injuries. They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of fabric structures expertise on the projects with Frei Otto, BuroHappold was instrumental in further developing the knowledge and technology of fabric structures. With Bodo Rasch, a protégé of Frei Otto, and drawing on <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> the Pink Floyd canopies, they designed folding, umbrella-like canopies to shade the courtyard of Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (The Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina, Saudi Arabia. They also designed the, at the time, largest fabric canopy in Europe at the Ashford Designer Outlet in the UK.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 17th century, England was {{embroiled in}} {{conflict}} with commercial rival Holland through the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Rupert became closely involved in these as a senior Admiral to King Charles II, rising to command the Royal Navy {{by the end of}} his career. Although several famous admirals of the day had previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monk, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively unusual for the period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> his campaigns in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|In Tatum's {{final season}} in College Park, Maryland spent four weeks as the first-ranked {{team in the}} AP Poll and ten weeks {{ranked in the top}} three. No {{opponent}} managed more than 13 points during the regular season. Maryland again had the first-ranked rushing defense in the nation, allowing 83.9 yards per game. Frank Tamburello became the starting quarterback, and entered the season with significant game <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> the prior year as a reserve behind Charlie Boxold. Fullback Tom Selep missed the season due to a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's cinema {{offers a}} {{different}} definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, {{unlike many other}} contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent years he has also progressively trimmed down {{the size of his}} films, which Akrami believes reduces the film making <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.|$|E
5|$|Matabele raiding parties {{attacked}} the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo. In pouring rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets. Forbes felt so humiliated {{by the events}} that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff. In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure {{the survival of the}} haggard men. He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} {{of the task force}} were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training. Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat <b>experience</b> <b>from</b> World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E

The country's {{participation}} at Rio de Janeiro marked {{its sixth}} consecutive {{appearance at the}} Summer Olympics. Three athletes from São Tomé and Princípe were selected for the Games. Romário Leitão and Celma Bonfim da Graça participated in athletics and Buly Triste in flatwater canoeing. Bonfim was the only female on the roster and the only member with prior Olympic <b>experience</b> (<b>from</b> Beijing 2008).

5|$|The PSO {{project cost}} the {{ministry}} at least 25 million.

Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced {{that there would be no}} more public tenders in the railway sector.

Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota {{and elsewhere in the}} Northern Mariana Islands, {{and as a result of}} its impact the name was retired.|$|E
