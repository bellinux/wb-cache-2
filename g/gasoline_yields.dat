Higher CHT indicated lower secondary cracking activity of liquid products especially gasoline and <b>gasoline</b> <b>yields.</b> Although the LAS amount was reduced after Mg doping when Mg/Al molar ratio was less than 1.0, the pre-cracking of VGO was enhanced due to the decreased activity of nonselective hydrogen transfer reactions which was reflected in the low yield of coke. In addition, the basic sites of MgO exhibited high hydrogen capacity that contributed to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen [12, 27]. However, the Zn/Mg 0.5 Al 2 O 3 had a higher CHT of 0.74 than that of Zn/Mg 1.0 Al 2 O 3 (CHT =  0.62) although the latter had higher Mg content. Therefore, the analysis of comparative results of Zn/Mg 0.5 Al 2 O 3 and Zn/Mg 1.0 Al 2 O 3 indicated that only combining with the Lewis acidity could the high activity of hydrogen transfer be achieved [2, 11]. However, the excess Mg on additives suppressed the secondary cracking of gasoline and diesel when Mg/Al molar ratio was more than 1.0. Hence, the higher CTO ratio was needed to achieve the same conversion level that led to higher coke yield and yields of gasoline and diesel.|$|E

40|$|Gasoline {{coming from}} {{refinery}} {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) unit is {{a major contributor to}} the total commercial grade gasoline pool. The contents of the FCC gasoline are primarily paraffins, naphthenes, olefins, aromatics, and undesirables such as sulfur and sulfur containing compounds in low quantities. The proportions of these components in the FCC gasoline invariable determine its quality as well as the performance of the associated downstream units. The increasing demand for cleaner and lighter fuels significantly influences the need not only for novel processing technologies but also for alternative refinery and petrochemical feedstocks. Current and future clean gasoline requirements include increased isoparaffins contents, reduced olefin contents, reduced aromatics, reduced benzene, and reduced sulfur contents. The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of processing an unconventional refinery feedstock, composed of blend of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) on FCC full range <b>gasoline</b> <b>yields</b> and compositional spectrum including its paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, napthenes, and aromatics contents distribution within a range of operating variables of temperature (500 – 700 °C) and catalyst-feed oil ratio (CFR 5 – 10) using spent equilibrium FCC Y-zeolite based catalyst in a FCC pilot plant operated at the University of Alicante’s Research Institute of Chemical Process Engineering (RICPE). The coprocessing of the oil-polymer blend led to the production of gasoline with very similar yields and compositions as those obtained from the base oil, albeit, in some cases, the contribution of the feed polymer content as well as the processing variables on the gasoline compositional spectrum were appreciated. Carbon content analysis showed a higher fraction of the C 9 –C 12 compounds at all catalyst rates employed and for both feedstocks. The gasoline’s paraffinicity, olefinicity, and degrees of branching of the paraffins and olefins were also affected in various degrees by the scale of operating severity. In the majority of the cases, the gasoline aromatics tended toward the decrease as the reactor temperature was increased. While the paraffins and iso-paraffins gasoline contents were relatively stable at around 5 % wt, the olefin contents on the other hand generally increased with increase in the FCC reactor temperature.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+YCP:ATU:CMI:YSCInternational audienceIn {{order to}} meet the EU’s {{renewable}} energy targets by 2020 (up to 10 % share in all forms of transportation fuels), a realistic alternative to first generation bio-fuels is to produce hybrid bio/fossil fuels by co-refining biomass pyrolysis liquids (PL) with crude oil fractions in a conventional oil refinery. However, co-refining may lead to severe changes in products quality, such as a higher aromaticity and residual oxygenates in the hybrid fuels that are produced. For the case of co-FCC (fluid catalytic cracking), various strategies can be implemented to limit those impacts along this complex value chain ranging from bio-mass to bio-gasoline. A first strategy was tested to preserve the gasoline yield and quality by implementing a PL hydrotreating prior to co-processing, to lower their oxygen content. By following the changes in conversion, yields and gasoline composition (aromatics/olefins vs saturated alkanes) {{as a function of the}} bio-oils hydrotreating severity, measured in a Micro Activity Test (MAT) reactor, it was shown that a compromise could be reached between bio-oil upgrading severity and FCC products yields and quality (RON, PIONA analysis). An optimum in the <b>gasoline</b> <b>yields</b> and quality was found by adding 10 to 25 wt. % of a mildly deoxygenated bio-oil to a standard VGO, via a co-processing carried out on a commercial equilibrated FCC catalyst. A second strategy was to adapt the FCC catalysts to the presence of oxygenate molecules typical of the bio-feedstock still present in the upgraded pyrolytic liquids. To that end, Y zeolites, which are the main active component in FCC catalysts, were up-graded by creating a mesoporosity in addition to the microporosity to favor the diffusion of the large lignocellulosic fragments throughout the cracking catalysts, according various hierarchical post synthesis processes. The main effects of replacing progressively micro- by meso-porosity are i) to slightly increase naphta yields (Fig. 1), ii) to decrease coke formation at high conversion (Fig. 2), iii) to increase the unsaturated fraction in gaseous (C 3 -C 5) (Fig. 3) and liquid products (not shown here), and iv) to decrease markedly the remaining oxygenated products in the liquid fraction (mainly alcohols, acids and phenolics, from 31 PNMR measurements). These effects underline the positive role of creating a mesoporosity in hierarchical FCC catalysts, in line with cracking mechanistic features. The combined impact for these two strategies on co-FCC will be discussed as a guideline for minimizing the cost of bio-oils upgrading and thereof the hybrid transportation fuels, while maintaining their quality within the specification limits.

The standardization on LDO- 75 catalyst after its system inventory reaches 80  % shows that the light oil yield and total liquid yield have increased 1.37 and 0.54  %, respectively; After adopting LCC- 2 catalyst and compared to 0  % case scenario, the propylene yield increases by 1.01  %. When LCC-A reaches 6  % of system inventory, the propylene yield increases by 1.41  % and RON by 1.5 units; the total liquid yield increases by 1.44  % and slurry yield drops by 1.41  % after LHO- 1 catalyst reaches 80  % of system inventory; LDC- 200 catalyst’s application shows 1.77  % total liquid yield increase, 0.83  % light oil yield increase and 1.72  % increase on propylene selectivity. The gasoline RON also increases 1.5 units; by adopting TMP technology and its matching catalyst LCC- 300, propylene yield in product distribution reached as high as 20.38  %; When MIP process matching catalyst LIP- 100 ’s system inventory reached 100  %, LPG’s yield increased by 1.04  %, <b>gasoline</b> <b>yield</b> increased by 0.74  %; The comparison of results between end-term and blank case standardization of MIP-CGP process matching catalyst LDR- 100 shows 0.4  wt% increase in diesel yield, 3.52  wt% increase in LPG yield and 1.3 units on gasoline RON.|$|R
30|$|By {{taking into}} {{consideration}} the operating conditions and yields of the FCC, the propylene yield pattern can be represented {{in the form of}} a continuum varying from operating severity to process design and these can be optimized to suit the refinery specific economics [32]. The optimum process design provides refiners with the flexibility to move up or down the optimal economic range of the propylene yield curve as shown in Fig.  3. From Fig.  3, it can be seen that higher propylene production comes at the expense of gasoline. For traditional refiners, maximizing <b>gasoline</b> <b>yield</b> is more important than the propylene yield, while for those interested in petrochemical applications, the target is operating at maximum propylene yield.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{the research and}} the results obtained by the author concerning the kinetic modeling of the riser of the catalytic cracking unit. This study is structured in four parts. The first part {{presents the}} process description and the actual kinetic model existent in the special literature. The next part contains a detailed presentation of the two kinetic models developed by the author for the catalytic cracking riser reactor (four and three lump kinetic model). The final part presents the comparison results of the three and four lump kinetic model. The results reveal the 4 lump kinetic model is more appropriate to represent the kinetic model of the catalytic cracking process, {{in the sense that}} a higher <b>gasoline</b> <b>yield</b> is thus obtained, whereas a lower quantity of coke is obtained...|$|R
