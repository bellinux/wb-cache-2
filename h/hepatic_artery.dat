25|$|<b>Hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> {{thrombosis}} usually {{occurs as}} a devastating complication after liver transplantation.|$|E
25|$|It {{begins on}} the right in the omental tuber, and is in {{relation}} with the celiac artery, from which the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> courses to the right just above the gland, while the splenic artery runs toward the left in a groove along this border.|$|E
25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
30|$|In our series, two of {{the eight}} donor {{candidates}} with circumportal pancreas (25 %) had variant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> and the prevalence of variant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> {{was similar to that}} without circumportal pancreas (23.4 %). This result suggests that there is no association between circumportal pancreas and variant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{portal vein}} and <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> form the liver's dual blood supply. Approximately 75% of hepatic blood flow {{is derived from}} the portal vein, while the {{remainder}} is from the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The liver {{receives}} a dual blood supply from the {{hepatic portal vein}} and <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b> The <b>hepatic</b> portal vein delivers approximately 75% of the liver's blood supply, and carries venous blood drained from the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and its associated organs. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its blood flow. Oxygen is provided from both sources; {{approximately half of the}} liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{occasionally}} used {{if there is}} pain due to anatomic extension, such as metastasis to bone. [...] Some [...] PanNETs absorb specific peptides or hormones, and these PanNETs may respond to nuclear medicine therapy with radiolabeled peptides or hormones such as iobenguane (iodine-131-MIBG). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> embolization may also be used.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with many}} {{experimental}} models used in early surgical research, the first attempts at liver transplantation {{were performed on}} dogs. The earliest published reports of canine liver transplantations were performed in 1955 by Vittorio Staudacher at Opedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. This initial attempt varied significantly from contemporary techniques; for example, Staudacher reported [...] "arterialization" [...] of the donor portal vein via the recipient <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> and use of cholecystostomy for biliary drainage.|$|E
2500|$|The donor's {{blood in}} the liver will be {{replaced}} by an ice-cold organ storage solution, such as UW (Viaspan) or HTK until the allograft liver is implanted. [...] Implantation involves anastomoses (connections) of the inferior vena cava, portal vein, and <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> [...] After blood flow is restored to the new liver, the biliary (bile duct) anastomosis is constructed, either to the recipient's own bile duct or to the small intestine. The surgery usually takes between five and six hours, but may be longer or shorter due to the difficulty of the operation and the experience of the surgeon.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Current {{anatomical}} classifications do {{not include}} all variants relevant for radioembolization (RE). The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the individual hepatic arterial configuration and segmental vascularization pattern and to develop an individualized RE treatment strategy based on an extended classification. METHODS: The hepatic vascular anatomy was assessed on MDCT and DSA in patients who received a workup for RE between February 2009 and November 2012. Reconstructed MDCT studies were assessed to determine the hepatic arterial configuration (origin of every hepatic arterial branch, branching pattern and anatomical course) and the hepatic segmental vascularization territory of all branches. Aberrant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> were defined as hepatic arterial branches that did not originate from the celiac axis/CHA/PHA. Early branching patterns were defined as hepatic arterial branches originating from the celiac axis/CHA. RESULTS: The hepatic arterial configuration and segmental vascularization pattern could be assessed in 110 of 133 patients. In 59 patients (54 %), no aberrant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> or early branching was observed. Fourteen patients without aberrant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> (13 %) had an early branching pattern. In the 37 patients (34 %) with aberrant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> five also had an early branching pattern. Sixteen different hepatic arterial segmental vascularization patterns were identified and described, differing by the presence of aberrant <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> their respective vascular territory, and origin of the artery vascularizing segment four. CONCLUSIONS: The hepatic arterial configuration and segmental vascularization pattern show marked individual variability beyond well-known classifications of anatomical variants. We developed an individualized RE treatment strategy based on an extended anatomical classification...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{example is}} the {{injection}} of yttrium-90 radioactive glass or resin microspheres into the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases. [...] These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as selective internal radiation therapy. The microspheres are approximately 30µm in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a catheter up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently two different kinds of microspheres: SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere.|$|E
2500|$|Before transplantation, liver-support therapy {{might be}} {{indicated}} (bridging-to-transplantation). Artificial liver support like liver dialysis or bioartificial liver support concepts are currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation. Virtually all liver transplants {{are done in}} an orthotopic fashion, that is, the native liver is removed and the new liver {{is placed in the}} same anatomic location. The transplant operation can be conceptualized as consisting of the hepatectomy (liver removal) phase, the anhepatic (no liver) phase, and the postimplantation phase. The operation is done through a large incision in the upper abdomen. [...] The hepatectomy involves division of all ligamentous attachments to the liver, as well as the common bile duct, <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> hepatic vein and portal vein. [...] Usually, the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava is removed along with the liver, although an alternative technique preserves the recipient's vena cava ("piggyback" [...] technique).|$|E
2500|$|Acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is an {{analgesic}} {{medication that}} can affect the liver when administered in high doses. [...] Acetaminophen is predominantly conjugated into glucuronate and sulfate moieties by Phase II metabolism. [...] A small percentage is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway to a toxic metabolite, NAPQI. [...] NAPQI is conjugated by glutathione to non-toxic cysteine and mercapturic acid moieties. [...] In cases of acetaminophen toxicity, the Phase II conjugation enzymes are saturated, and a higher fraction is converted to NAPQI. [...] The conjugation of NAPQI to glutathione occurs until glutathione is depleted from hepatic reserves, after which the toxic NAPQI accumulates and causes damage to the hepatocytes. [...] This occurs primarily {{in areas of the}} liver that are relatively poorly perfused with oxygen, or furthest away from the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> termed Zone 3. [...] Acetaminophen overdose is associated with Zone 3 necrosis, to the point that acute liver failure may result.|$|E
50|$|E. abramovi {{has been}} found in the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> of European elk (Alces alces), Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and Red deer (Cervus elaphus), as {{discussed}} in. E. abramovi has only been found in Russia.|$|R

60|$|Section 61. The liver is {{the most}} {{complicated}} gland in the body (Figure X.). The bile duct (b.d.) branches again and again, and ends at last in the final pits, the lobuli (lb.), which are lined with secretory epithelium, and tightly packed, and squeeze each other into polygonal forms. The blood supply from which the bile {{would appear to be}} mainly extracted, is brought by the portal vein, but this blood is altogether unfit for the nutrition of the liver tissue; for this latter purpose a branch of the coeliac artery, the hepatic serves. Hence in the tissue of the liver we have, branching and interweaving among the lobuli, the small branches of the bile duct (b.d.), which carries away the bile formed, the portal vein (p.v.), the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> (h.a.), and the hepatic vein (h.v.). (Compare Section 45.) Figure X.b shows a lobule; the portal vein and the artery ramify round the lobules-- are inter-lobular, that is (inter, between); the hepatic vein begins {{in the middle of the}} lobules (intra-lobular), and receives their blood. (Compare X.a.) Besides its function in the manufacture of the excretory, digestive, and auxiliary bile, the liver performs other duties. It appears to act as an inspector of the assimilation material brought in by the portal vein. The villi, for instance, will absorb arsenic, but this is arrested and thrown down in the liver. A third function is the formation of what would seem to be a store of carbo-hydrate, glycogen, mainly it would appear, from the sugar in the portal vein, though also, very probably, from nitrogenous material, though this may occur only under exceptional conditions. Finally, the nitrogenous katastates, formed in the working of muscle and nerve, and returned by them to the blood for excretion, are not at that stage in the form of urea. Whatever form they assume, they undergo a further metabolism into urea before leaving the body, and the presence of considerable quantities of this latter substance in the liver suggests this as a fourth function of this organ-- the elaboration of urea.|$|E

30|$|The {{advantages}} of OVA using the region-growing method with 3 D CT software are as follows: (1) 3 D imaging of liver structures, (2) detailed volumetric analyses based on portal perfusion, and (3) quantitative {{estimates of the}} venous drainage area, enabling the investigation of unknown fields that cannot be examined using conventional two-dimensional modalities such as hand-tracing volumetry [3, 4]. According to the manufacturer’s information for OVA, the software {{is based on an}} algorithm that defines the perfusion area of each portal branch based on the direction and diameter of vessels [3, 4]. In the present case, the region-growing method was applied to the 3 D image reconstruction of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b> Compared with the extraction of the arteries using semi-automatic tracing of the arteries, that using the region-growing method produced a more objective 3 D image because extracted arterial images were reconstructed based on the CT densities of the voxels within the specified range of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and not of the surrounding portal vein. The reconstruction of 3 D image of these small less-contrasted branches using the region-growing method was visually successful.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hepatic {{resection}} is {{the only}} effective treatment for combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Case presentation A 52 -year-old man was preoperatively diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in segment 2 with tumor thrombus in the segment 2 portal branch. Anatomical liver segmentectomy 2, including separation of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> portal veins, and bile duct, enabled us to remove the tumor and portal thrombus completely. Modified selective hepatic vascular exclusion, which combines extrahepatic control of the left and middle hepatic veins with occlusion of left hemihepatic inflow, was used to reduce blood loss. A pathological examination revealed combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with tumor thrombus in the segment 2 portal branch. No postoperative liver failure occurred, and remnant liver function was adequate. Conclusion The separation method of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> portal veins, and bile duct is safe and feasible for a liver cancer patient with portal vein tumor thrombus. Modified selective hepatic vascular exclusion was useful to control bleeding during liver transection. Anatomical liver segmentectomy 2 using these procedures should be considered for a patient with a liver tumor located at segment 2 arising from a damaged liver. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The normal liver {{histology}} of the African palm squirrel Epixerus ebii {{was investigated}} {{to fill the}} information gap on its micromorphology from available literature. The liver was covered by a capsule of dense connective tissue- the perivascular fibrous capsule. Beneath this capsule is the liver parenchyma were the hepatocyte were supported by reticular fibres. The hepatocytes in the lobules were hexagonal to polygonal in shape. Some hepatocytes were bi-nucleated. Clear spaces in the parenchyma must be storage sites for lipids in the liver. The classic hepatic lobules presented central vein surrounded by several liver cells. At the portal triad, <b>hepatic</b> vein, <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and bile ducts were seen. While the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins were lined by endothelium, the bile ducts were lined by simple cuboidal cells. Nerve fibres were also seen {{in the region of}} the portal triad. Hepatic sinusoids lined by endothelium were seen in the liver parenchyma between liver lobules. The sinusoids contained macrophages. This report will aid wild life biologists in further investigative research and Veterinarians in diagnosing the hepatic diseases of the African palm squirrel.
