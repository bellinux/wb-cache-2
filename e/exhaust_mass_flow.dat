Using a phenomenological zero-dimensional {{approach}} with five continuous and three discrete states we first model {{the effects of}} the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve, the exhaust Rebreathing Lift (RBL), and the fueling rate on the state of charge in the cylinder at intake valve closing. An Arrhenius integral is then used to model the start of combustion, θsoc. A series of simple algebraic relations that captures the combustion duration and heat release is finally used to model the state of charge after the HCCI combustion and the Location of Peak Pressure (LPP). The model is parameterized and validated using steady-state test data from an experimental engine at the General Motors Corporation. The simple model captures the temperature, pressure, air-to-fuel ratio, and inert gas fraction of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> This characterization is important for the overall HCCI dynamics because the thermodynamic state (pressure, tem-perature) and concentration (oxygen and inert gas) of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> affect the next combustion event.

40|$|Cost {{is equally}} {{important}} to power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste heat recovery thermoelectric generators (TEG) in many transportation and industrial energy recovery applications. In many cases the system design that minimizes cost (e. g., the $/W value) can be very different than the design that maximizes the system's efficiency or power density, {{and it is important}} to understand the relationship between those designs to optimize TEG performance-cost compromises. Expanding on recent cost analysis work and using more detailed system modeling, an enhanced cost scaling analysis of a waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator with more detailed, coupled treatment of the heat exchangers has been performed. In this analysis, the effect of the heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the hot-side and cold-side conductances that maximize power output are considered. This coupled thermal and thermoelectric treatment of the exhaust waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator yields modified cost scaling and design optimization equations, which are now strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate, and heat exchanger effectiveness. This work shows that heat exchanger costs most often dominate the overall TE system costs, that it is extremely difficult to escape this regime, and in order to achieve TE system costs of $ 1 /W it is necessary to achieve heat exchanger costs of $ 1 /(W/K). Minimum TE system costs per watt generally coincide with maximum power points, but Preferred TE Design Regimes are identified where there is little cost penalty for moving into regions of higher efficiency and slightly lower power outputs. These regimes are closely tied to previously-identified low cost design regimes. This work shows that the optimum fill factor Fopt minimizing system costs decreases as heat losses increase, and increases as <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate and heat exchanger effectiveness increase. These findings have profound implications on the design and operation of various thermoelectric (TE) waste heat 3 recovery systems. This work highlights the importance of heat exchanger costs on the overall TEG system costs, quantifies the possible TEG performance-cost domain space based on heat exchanger effects, and provides a focus for future system research and development efforts...|$|E

Besides the intrinsic robustness of the filter products a well designed operating strategy is required for the successful use of filters. The operating strategy is comprised of two elements: the soot estimation and the regeneration strategy.

The numerical model is able {{to keep track of the}} amount of soot in the flow; the increasing of back-pressure through the exhaust system (mainly due to the Diesel Particulate Filter) can be predicted by the calculation of the permeability variation of the porous wall, as the soot particles goes inside the DPF.

40|$|In {{this study}} the main {{objective}} was to estimate the instantaneous turbine shaft power and turbine efficiency of a turbocharger mounted on a 6 -cylinder 13 literheavy-duty diesel engine. The work was carried out at Scania CV AB in Södertälje, Sweden from January to June 2015 as master thesis under the division of Internal Combustion Engines at the Royal Institute of Technology KTH, Stockholm, Sweden. Normally the turbine performance is estimated during off-engine conditions in a gas flow bench during steady flow. When the turbocharger is mounted on the engine, the flow {{is far from being}} steady. The exhaust gas flow is pulsating and every thermodynamic property with it as well. In this thesis theturbine performance is estimated 1 crank angle degree resolved with 1 crank angle degree resolved pressures and turbocharger speed. Parameters difficult to measure crank angle resolved such as temperature and <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate are estimated utilizing methods found in literature. The turbine efficiency is defined as the utilized turbine shaft power divided with the isentropic turbine power. The utilized shaft power consists of the power consumed by the compressor, which is assumed to be constant in this thesis, the power lost due to bearing friction and the acceleration power of the rotating parts. The result of the used method revealed a fluctuating turbine efficiency, very seldom at the same levels as the optimal efficiency obtained during steady flow during one engine cycle. The results where promising, but lacked the needed accuracy to estimate the instantaneous turbine performance with proven confidence. Primarily this is believed to be caused by the instantaneous <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate approximation based on a calculated dynamical pressure. Another factor impacting the overall accuracy is the assumed constant compressor power. Further development of the method is needed and could yield results with better confidence in the future. Denna rapport handlar om skattning av momentan turbinaxeleffekt och turbinverkningsgrad för ett turboaggregat monterat på en 6 -cylindrig 13 liter stordieselmotor. Arbetet gjordes på och för Scania CV AB i Södertälje, från Januari till Juni 2015, som ett examensarbete under institutionen Förbränningsmotorteknik på Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan, Stockholm. När turbinprestandan normalt bestämms, sker detta i en s. k. flödesbänk där turbinen matas med ett konstant flöde. När turbon är monterad på en motor ser flädessituationen annorlunda ut, avgasflödet och dess termodynamiska tillståndpulserar. I den här rapporten skattas turbinprestandan vevvinkelupplöst med hjälp av vevvinkelupplösta tryck och turbovarvtal. Parametrar nästintill omöjliga att mäta vevinkeluppöst såsom temperatur och avgasmassflöde har skattats vevvinkelupplöst med metoder funna i litteratur. Turbinverkningsgraden består av den utnyttjade axeleffekten dividerad medden isentropa turbineffekten, där den utnyttjade axeleffekten består av kompressoreffekten vilken betraktats som konstant, en lagerfriktionsförlust samt enaccelerationseffekt av de roterande delarna i turbon. Resultatet visade att turbineeffekten och turbinverkningsgraden fluktuerade, som väntat med fluktuerande ingångsparmetrar och att verkningsgraden sällan är den optimala framtagen under konstant flöde. Den använda metodiken visade sig ge ett lovande resultat, men saknade tillräcklig noggranhet för att bestämma turbinverkningsgraden med stort förtroende över en hel motorcykel.

The impacts of EGR applied to a combined gas turbine cycle were investigated quantitatively on the energy demand of MEA-based chemical absorption. Simulations show that compared to a combined cycle without EGR, a recircualtion ratio of 50  could increase CO 2 concentration from 3. 8 mol% to 7. 9 mol% and reduce the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> of the absorber feed stream by 51. 0 %.

5000|$|Turbochargers suffer (to {{a greater}} or lesser extent) from {{so-called}} turbo-spool (turbo lag; more correctly, boost lag), in which initial acceleration from low RPM is limited by the lack of sufficient <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> (pressure). Once engine RPM is sufficient to raise the turbine RPM into its designed operating range, there is a rapid increase in power, as higher turbo boost causes more exhaust gas production, which spins the turbo yet faster, leading to a belated [...] "surge" [...] of acceleration. This makes the maintenance of smoothly increasing RPM far harder with turbochargers than with engine-driven superchargers, which apply boost in direct proportion to the engine RPM. The main advantage of an engine with a mechanically driven supercharger is better throttle response, as well as the ability to reach full-boost pressure instantaneously. With the latest turbocharging technology and direct gasoline injection, throttle response on turbocharged cars is nearly as good as with mechanically powered superchargers, but the existing lag time is still considered a major drawback, especially considering {{that the vast majority of}} mechanically driven superchargers are now driven off clutched pulleys, much like an air compressor.|$|R
40|$|The {{emissions}} from vehicles {{in real world}} driving are of current concern, as they are often higher than on legislated test cycles and this may explain why air quality in cities has not improved {{in proportion to the}} reduction in automotive emissions. This has led to the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) legislation in Europe. RDE involves journeys of about 90 km with roughly equal proportion of urban, rural and motorway driving. However, air quality exceedances occur in cities with urban congested traffic driving as the main source of the emissions that deteriorate the air quality. Thus the emissions measured on RDE journeys may not be relevant to air quality in cities. A Temet FTIR and Horiba <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement system was used for the mass emissions measurements in a Euro 4 SI vehicle. A 5 km urban journey on a very congested road was undertaken 29 times at various times so that different traffic congestion was encountered. Each journey was split into ten sections in order that the location and traffic conditions of the highest emissions could be determined. It was found that low speed stop-start traffic has much higher emissions than for freely moving traffic and most of the higher emissions on the longer 5 km journeys occurred in relatively short sections of slow moving stop/start traffic. The journey used passed a roadside air quality monitor that exceeded the EU NO 2 and PM standards on an annual basis and it was located by the most congested part of the route, where the traffic emissions are shown in this work to be at their highest...|$|E

The model of a 6 -cylinder turbocharged engine (Holset HDX 55 V) was calibrated using an experimental BSFC map to predict engine exhaust thermodynamic conditions such as <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate and exhaust temperature under various operating conditions. These engine exhaust conditions were then utilized to feed the inlet conditions for both the ORC and turbocompounding models, evaluating the available exhaust energy to be recovered by each technology. Firstly the ORC system model was simulated to obtain the power that can be generated from the system. Having this additional power converted to useful work, the BSFC was observed to reduce around 2 – 5 % depending upon engine’s speed and BMEP. The initial model of the engine was then modified by considering a second turbine representing turbocompounding heat recovery system. The BSFC was increased due to the back-pressure from the second turbine, but the energy generated from the turbine was sufficient to reduce the BSFC further. However, by application of turbocompounding no improvement in BSFC was achieved at low engine’s speeds. It is concluded that ORC heat recovery system produces a satisfactory results at low engine speeds with both low and high loads whereas at medium and high engine speeds turbocompounding heat recovery system causes higher BSFC reduction...|$|E

The standard layout of the DEP system comprises of two separately-functioned exhaust valves with one valve feeding the blow-down pulse to the turbine whilst the other valve targeting the scavenging behaviour by bypassing the turbine. Via combining the characteristics of both turbocharged engines and naturally aspirated engines, this method can provide large BSFC improvement. The DEP concept has only been applied to single-stage turbocharged engines so far. However, it in its basic form {{is in no way}} restricted to a single-stage system.

As the major objective of this project is to explore the gas exchange process for the DEP-based R 2 S downsized engine, the knock model in the system is ignored. The results showed that PMEP is significantly improved over the entire engine speed and BSFC was decreased by up to 3 % with minimum modification of the original system.

The model is described as a linear thermodynamic grey-box model withflow varying parameters, showing good results in validation. The model provides a simulation environment during the controller design, which isfocused around the development of linear regulators with the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> flowas a scheduling variable whose size determines controllers’ mode of operation. Basedon this approach an IMC controller and a PI controller with a combined feedforwardterm are developed and analyzed. Both controllers show good performance in termsof robustness and reference tracking. The authors' firm opinion is that controlstrategies with the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> as a scheduling variable is suitable forkeeping control of the temperature in the particulate filter during regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Power {{generation}} {{is one of}} the largest anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission sources; although it is now reducing in carbon intensity due to switching from coal to gas, this is only part of a bridging solution that will require the utilization of carbon capture technologies. Gas turbines, such as those at the UK Carbon Capture Storage Research Centre's Pilot-scale Advanced CO 2 Capture Technology (UKCCSRC PACT) National Core Facility, have high <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates with relatively low CO 2 concentrations; therefore solvent-based post-combustion capture is energy intensive. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can increase CO 2 levels, reducing the capture energy penalty. The aim of this paper is to simulate EGR through enrichment of the combustion air with CO 2 to assess changes to turbine performance and potential impacts on complete generation and capture systems. The oxidising air was enhanced with CO 2, up to 6. 29 %vol dry, impacting mechanical performance, reducing both engine speed by over 400  revolutions per minute and compression temperatures. Furthermore, it affected complete combustion, seen in changes to CO and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. This impacted on turbine efficiency, which increased specific fuel consumption (by 2. 9 %). CO 2 enhancement could therefore result in significant efficiency gains for the capture plant...|$|R
50|$|Only the {{limitations}} of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the compression ratio of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high propulsive efficiency because even slightly increasing the velocity {{of a very large}} volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the <b>exhaust</b> is the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities. A low disc loading (thrust per disc area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.|$|R
40|$|Turbochargers are {{becoming}} an essential device in internal combustion engines as they boost the intake air with more pressure {{in order to}} increase the power output. These devices are normally designed for a single steady design point but the pulsating flow delivered from the internal combustion engine is everything but steady. The efficiency drop experienced in the off-design points by the fixed geometry turbochargers have made some research groups to look into new variable geometry solutions for turbocharging. A nozzle ring is a device which normally achieves a higher performance under design conditions, but the efficiency rapidly drops at off-design conditions. In this paper, a variable angle nozzle ring is designed and implemented in the model of a radial turbine of a turbocharger in order to study its potential when working under real internal combustion engine cycles. To understand the profit margin the turbine performance is compared with two turbines with the same impeller geometry: one without nozzle ring and one with a nozzle ring with a fixed angle. The results show that the maximum efficiency angle function calculated for the variable angle nozzle ring achieves an improvement in the total efficiency of 5 % when comparing with a turbine with a fixed angle and 18 % when comparing with a vaneless turbine. The improved guidance achieved due to the variable blade angle leads to less turbine losses and therefore more mechanical energy can be extracted from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> throughout all the combustion cycle but a further study should be made in order to match all the engine operations points. Notably, taking the pulsating boundary conditions into consideration, a remarkable improvement is achieved already for the fixed angle nozzle ring. ...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, a new gas exchange concept termed divided exhaust period regulated two-stage (DEP R 2 S) {{system has been}} proposed. In this system, two exhaust valves in each cylinder are separately functioned with one valve feeding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> into the high-pressure (HP) manifold, while the other valve evacuating the remaining mass flow directly into the low-pressure (LP) manifold. By adjusting {{the timing of the}} exhaust valves, the target boost can be controllable while improving the engine's pumping work and scavenging is attainable which results in better fuel efficiency from the gas exchange perspective. This paper will continue this study by adding an appropriate knock model to examine the benefits this concept could bring to the combustion phasing. The results at full load showed that under knock limited spark advance (KLSA) and fully optimized exhaust valve timing condition, the DEP R 2 S system benefited from lower pumping loss and better scavenging due to the reduced backpressure and improved pulsation interference despite suffering from reduced expansion ratio and expansion work. The combustion phasing was advanced across the engine speed which is mainly attributed to the reduced residual and the reduced requirement of gross indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The net brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was observed to improve by up to 3 % depending on the engine operating points. At part load, the DEP R 2 S system {{could be used as a}} mechanism to extend the “duration” of the exhaust valve. This will reduce the recompression effect of the exhaust residuals during the beginning and the end of the exhaust stroke compared to the original R 2 S model with late exhaust valve opening and early exhaust valve opening. In addition, increased internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) due to the increased overlap between the LP and the intake valve is also beneficial for the improved pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) as the throttle can be further opened to reduce the corresponding throttling loss. The average net BSFC improvement is expected to be approximately 6 – 7 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of an ejector nozzle integrated with a reaction drive rotor configuration for a vertical takeoff and landing rotorcraft is considered in this research. The ejector nozzle is {{a device that}} imparts energy from a high speed airflow source to a lower speed secondary airflow inside a duct. The overall nozzle <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate is increased through fluid entrainment, while the exhaust gas velocity is simultaneously decreased. The exhaust gas velocity is strongly correlated to the jet noise produced by the nozzle, making the ejector {{a good candidate for}} propulsion system noise reduction. Ejector nozzles are mechanically simple in that there are no moving parts. However, coupled fluid dynamic processes are involved, complicating analysis and design. Geometric definitions of the ejector nozzle are determined through a reduced fidelity, multi-disciplinary, representation of the rotary wing ejector. The resulting rotary wing ejector geometric sizing procedure relates standard vehicle and rotor design parameters to the ejector. Additionally, a rotary wing ejector performance procedure is developed to compare this rotor configuration to a conventional rotor. Performance characteristics and aerodynamic effects of the rotor and ejector nozzle are analytically studied. Ejector nozzle performance, in terms of exit velocities, is compared to the primary reaction drive nozzle; giving an indication of the potential for noise reduction. Computational fluid dynamics are paramount in predicting the aerodynamic effects of the ejector nozzle located at the rotor blade tip. Two-dimensional, steady-state, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are implemented for sectional lift and drag predictions required for the rotor aerodynamic model associated with both the rotary wing ejector sizing and performance procedures. A three-dimensional, unsteady, RANS simulation of the rotary wing ejector is performed to study the aerodynamic interactions between the ejector nozzle and rotor. Overall performance comparisons are made between the two- and three-dimensional models of the rotary wing ejector, and a similar conventional rotor. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Daniel P.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{and economic}} {{analysis of a}} GT 10 gas turbine integrated with the air bottoming cycle is presented. The results are compared to commercially available combined cycle power plants {{based on the same}} gas turbine. The systems under analysis {{have a better chance of}} competing with steam bottoming cycle configurations in a small range of the power output capacity. The aim of the calculations is to determine the final cost of electricity generated by the gas turbine air bottoming cycle based on a 25 MW GT 10 gas turbine with the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate of about 80 kg/s. The article shows the results of thermodynamic optimization of the selection of the technological structure of gas turbine air bottoming cycle and of a comparative economic analysis. Quantities are determined that have a decisive impact on the considered units profitability and competitiveness compared to the popular technology based on the steam bottoming cycle. The ultimate quantity that can be compared in the calculations is the cost of 1 MWh of electricity. It should be noted that the systems analyzed herein are power plants where electricity is the only generated product.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{research}} {{effort of the}} automotive industry has been mainly focused on the reduction of CO 2 and pollutants emissions. In this scenario, concepts such as the engines downsizing, stop/start systems {{as well as more}} costly full hybrid solutions and, more recently, Waste Heat Recovery technologies have been proposed. These latter include Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and Electric Turbo-Compound (ETC) that have been practically implemented on few heavy-duty applications but have not been proved yet as effective and affordable solutions for passenger cars. The paper deals with modeling of ORC power plant for simulation analyses aimed at evaluating the opportunities and challenges of its application for the waste heat recovery in a compact car, powered by a turbocharged SI engine. A grey-box modeling approach has been applied to simulate the ORC plant components (i. e. pump, heat exchangers, scroll expander); model identification and validation have been carried out against literature experimental data, showing good agreement with published results. The ORC plant model has been integrated into a dynamic vehicle-engine model to estimate the recovered electric energy as function of hot side (exhaust gas) and cold side (ambient air or coolant) temperature as well as <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> Several simulations have been carried out to explore different driving conditions (e. g. NEDC, WLTC) and optimization analyses have been performed on ORC operating conditions and components to maximize the output power and reduce the packing. Results show that significant improvement of fuel economy can be achieved by suitable ORC operation, with average CO 2 savings up to 4 % on standard driving cycles for the analyzed vehicle model...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of heat {{recovery}} for electric power generation, Kalina cycle (a thermodynamic cycle using as working fluid a mixture of water and ammonia) and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) represent two dif- ferent eligible technologies. In this work a comparison between the thermodynamic performances of Kalina cycle and an ORC cycle, using hexamethyldisiloxane as working fluid, was conducted for the case of heat recovery from two Diesel engines, each one with an electrical power of 8900 kWe. The maximum net electric power that can be produced exploiting the heat source constituted by the <b>exhaust</b> gases <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> (35 kg/s for both engines, at 346 °C) was calculated for the two thermodynamic cycles. Owing to the relatively low useful power, for the Kalina cycle a relatively simple plant layout was assumed. Supposing reasonable design parameters and a logarithmic mean temperature difference in the heat recovery exchanger of 50 °C, a net electric power of 1615 kW and of 1603 kW respectively for the Kalina and for the ORC cycle was calculated. Although the obtained useful powers are actually equal in value, the Kalina cycle requires a very high maximum pressure {{in order to obtain}} high thermodynamic performances (in our case, 100 bar against about 10 bar for the ORC cycle). So, the adoption of Kalina cycle, at least for low power level and med- ium–high temperature thermal sources, seems not to be justified because the gain in performance with respect to a properly optimized ORC is very small and must be obtained with a complicated plant scheme, large surface heat exchangers and particular high pressure resistant and no-corrosion materials...|$|R
