5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose.</b>|$|E

The textbook IS/LM models, that rely so heavily on a monetary transmission mechanism running from “money” to activity and prices, {{may no longer}} be the most appropriate theoretical models for analysing monetary policy in a deregulated world. Despite this breakdown in the traditional monetary transmission mechanism, it is argued in this paper that monetary policy will continue to be effective in a deregulated environment. Worries that there will be price-level indeterminacy, no yard-stick to measure the stance of policy, and no rules to make monetary policy accountable in a fully deregulated world are not justified. A reaction function which ties the nominal short-term interest rate to a nominal anchor should ensure a stable steady state outcome. There are a number of alternative nominal anchors <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>chose,</b> including: nominal financial prices – the exchange rate or a long-term nominal interest rate; or more direct targets such as inflation or nominal GDP growth.
