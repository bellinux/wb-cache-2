40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the design methods {{and principles of}} operation of a fast-response integrated optical sensor for temperature measurement. The sensitive element consists of a microring resonator based on the double-slot waveguide made from Si 3 N 4 and coated on a SiO 2 buffer layer, which is disposed on a silicon substrate. The nematic 5 CB liquid crystal (LC) fills the slots of the ring waveguide. The sensor uses only the optical radiation, and the electrical current is not supplied to the measured matter. That allows applying such sensor for measuring the temperature of <b>highly</b> <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> and gases. The use of the microresonators based on the double-slot waveguides considerably (more than one order of magnitude) increases the sensor sensitivity. The operating speed of the device {{is defined by the}} time of establishing the steady-state regime in the ring microresonator and equals to tens of nanoseconds. The measuring device can consist {{of a large number of}} such sensing elements that allows simultaneously controlling the temperature in different points of the fluid flow or the matter volume. The sensor has a micrometer size and can be produced by using routine integrated technologies...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} a nondestructive and contactless screening method {{for water and}} <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> in common beverage plastic bottles by the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. No THz transmission has been observed between 10 and 60 cm− 1 for 45 -mm-thick water in plastic bottles. Part of the THz wave, on the other hand, has been transmitted through the commercially available <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> in the same bottles. The differences in the absorption intensities and the refractive indices in the THz region, which reflect the ingredients of organic compounds, allow us to distinguish these <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids.</b> We confirm that the screening method based on the THz transmission {{can be applied to}} classifying the commercially available <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> stored in plastic bottles and to distinguishing these <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> from water as well...|$|R

5000|$|The cargo {{included}} approximately 5,000 barrels, other containers, {{and bags}} containing inflammable substances (xylene, butanol, butyl acrylate, cyclohexanone, and sodium—contact of the sodium with water {{was the cause}} of the fire), toxins (aniline oil, diphenylmethane di-isocyanate, o-cresol, and dibutyl phthalate), and corrosives (phosphoric acid and phthalic anhydride). The <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> comprised at least 2,000 barrels stored in four of the five hold compartments. The nature of the cargo was initially unclear, but the Spanish newspaper El País identified it as [...] "several tons of a sodium compound, 110 tons of aniline oil, 6 tons of ethanol (grain alcohol) and 10 tons of an <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquid</b> of Grade 9 (maximum) danger", and the governor of A Coruña, Andres Moreno Aguilar, confirmed the list as accurate. There were rumours of nuclear material. Recovery of the dangerous substances that had not been swept into the sea by waves was completed on 12 December, after a deck was removed to access the deep tank where the aniline was stored. There were three injuries and one case of mild aniline poisoning among the salvage workers. A large portion of the cargo was not recovered; what was, was taken to the Alúmina-Aluminio plant in San Cibrao, causing alarm among the workers.|$|R

30|$|In the {{intensity}} range of 17 kW m− 1 to 350 kW m− 1 little damage {{is done to}} forest trees although some significant ecological changes can occur in this range. Many Australian species, particularly members of the Proteaceae, Myrtaceae and Casuarinaceae can be killed by these low intensity fires but little seedling regeneration will result as the fire is not hot enough to induce germination. Dogwood (Cassinia aculeate [Labill.] R.Br.) is another fire weed species which can be killed by a remarkably low intensity fire. Many of these species are <b>highly</b> <b>inflammable</b> and are undesirable fire fuel components.|$|R

40|$|Through the new {{modularization}} of {{the undergraduate}} science {{degree at the}} University of Brighton, larger numbers of students are choosing to take some science modules which include an amount of laboratory practical work. Indeed, within energy studies, the fuels and combustion module, for which the computer simulations were written, has seen a fourfold increase in student numbers from twelve to around fifty. Fitting out additional laboratories with new equipment to accommodate this increase presented problems: the laboratory space did not exist; fitting out the laboratories with new equipment would involve a relatively large capital spend per student for equipment {{that would be used}} infrequently; and, because some of the experiments use <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquids</b> and gases, additional staff would be needed for laboratory supervision...|$|R

Fires of quantities ranging from several pounds to several hundred pounds have been experienced and a number of extinguishers have been tried. Records of this work are available in our files.

25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquid</b> will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|R

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and <b>highly</b> <b>inflammable,</b> sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|R

Besides, DESs are {{commonly}} not flammable and have very low volatility, because their individual components are generally solids or <b>inflammable</b> <b>liquid.</b> These two properties decrease {{the risk of}} explosion and burning for an organic reaction if DESs are used as solvents instead of volatile organic solvents, thus making it safe to operate. What is more, density and viscosity are the other two important characteristics which affect the mass transfer when selecting a solvent for use. Generally, the viscosity of DESs lies in the constitution and is {{higher than that of}} the molecular solvent ethanol (Smith et al. 2014). The specific relationship between these factors has been documented at length in another review (Zhang et al. 2012). Most properties change as a function of temperature (Zhao et al. 2015). For instance, as the temperature increases, the density and viscosity decrease.|$|R
