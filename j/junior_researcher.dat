25|$|In May 1986 {{he became}} a <b>junior</b> <b>researcher</b> and diving {{specialist}} at the State Scientific Research Institute of Rescue, Diving, and Deep Sea Work of the Ministry of Defense. Solodkov participated in the creation and testing of diving equipment. While testing new technology, he spent a long period under 50 atmosphere pressure. Solodkov worked underwater and in the diving chamber for more than 3,000 hours. Solodkov spent 15 days underwater at 500 meters during a 1991 experiment and 25 days at 450 meters in a 1988 experiment. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 25 July 1990. On 24 December 1991, Solodkov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his contributions to diving. Solodkov {{was the last person}} awarded the title, receiving it two days before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Then with the Russian Navy, Solodkov received his Gold Star on 16 January 1992 from Yevgeny Shaposhnikov.|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival in}} London, Bohr rejoined his father, who had flown to Britain the week before. He officially became a <b>junior</b> <b>researcher</b> at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, [...] but {{actually}} served as personal assistant and secretary to his father. The two worked on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project. On 30 December 1943, {{they made the}} first of a number of visits to the United States, where his father was a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Due to his father's fame, they were given false names; Bohr became James Baker, and his father, Nicholas Baker. In 1945, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator. They reported that it would work. That they had reached this conclusion put Enrico Fermi's concerns about the viability of the design to rest. The initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1994, {{an article}} in the Chicago Tribune by John Crewdson stated that an {{anonymous}} <b>junior</b> <b>researcher</b> in Hamer’s laboratory alleged that Hamer selectively presented the data in his 1993 paper in the journal Science. The <b>junior</b> <b>researcher</b> had assisted in the gene mapping in Hamer's 1993 study. Shortly after voicing her questions, she was summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in Hamer’s lab; who dismissed her could not be determined. Later, she was given another position in a different lab. Hamer stated that Crewdson's article was [...] "seriously in error" [...] and denied the allegations made against him. An official inquiry launched by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to investigate [...] the allegations of selective presentation of the data ended in December 1996. It determined that Hamer had not committed any scientific misconduct in his study.|$|E
2500|$|Hakim Mohammed Said {{was born}} in [...] Delhi, British Indian Empire in 1920 to an educated and {{religious}} Urdu-speaking class family. His forefathers and family had {{been associated with the}} herbal medicine business, and had established the Hamdard Waqf Laboratories in India before 1947, which today has {{emerged as one of the}} largest manufacturers of Unani medicines in the world. Said attended the local school where he learned Arabic, Persian, Urdu, English and studied the Quran. At age 18, Hakim went on to attend the University of Delhi in 1938. There, Said obtained a B.Pharm degree and a BS degree in medicinal chemistry in 1942. After his undergraduate education, Said joined Hamdard Waqf Laboratories as a <b>junior</b> <b>researcher</b> and participated in herbal quality control while formulating medicines. In 1945, Said attended the post-graduate course, and obtained M.Pharm degree in Pharmacy from the same institution. Before 1947, Hakim Said was also involved in the Pakistan Movement activities. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Said left his hometown with his wife and only [...] daughter. The family settled in Karachi, Sindh Province of West Pakistan. He established Hamdard Laboratories and served as its first director until his death in 1998. In 1952, Said travelled to Turkey where he attended the Ankara University and was awarded a PhD degree in Pharmacy, then returned to Pakistan to devote his life to medicine research.|$|E

40|$|Master {{students}} and <b>junior</b> <b>researchers</b> within the Information Systems (IS) field often struggle to frame their knowledge contributions when reporting their research. In this paper, we investigated this research question: {{what are the}} forms of knowledge contributions that can be targeted in information systems research? We analysed a selection of NOKOBIT papers that were written by <b>junior</b> <b>researchers,</b> with their previous masters or PhD supervisors as co-authors. As expected, we found that all papers followed the same script of identifying a research gap and trying to fill it. While the practical contributions often can be acknowledged, the theoretical contribution can {{be more difficult to}} identify. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we suggest a taxonomy of various forms of knowledge contributions in Information Systems research. Second, we present contribution-focused guidelines for <b>junior</b> <b>researchers.</b> This study should be of interest to master {{students and}} <b>junior</b> <b>researchers,</b> as well as to their supervisors...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{presented}} in this article forms part of a wider project promoting collaboration between <b>junior</b> <b>researchers</b> from different universities with the objective of rethinking and improving teaching practice in relation to the use of technology. The article describes research carried out during the 2012 / 13 academic year aimed at developing collaborative action research through technologically mediated agoras involving students from three Spanish universities. The main results of this study show that <b>junior</b> <b>researchers</b> improved their teaching practice through technologically mediated inside and outside agoras. In addition, the transformation of university classrooms into agoras enabled the negotiated reconstruction of knowledge for the analysis of good practice in the use of technology. Likewise, these agoras helped reduce limitations by breaking down the barriers of time, distance and resources for sharing findings and limitations between <b>junior</b> <b>researchers.</b> Furthermore, they pave the way for improvements and their implementation in learning processes during initial teacher training...|$|R
