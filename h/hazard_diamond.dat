40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the term {{structure of the}} hazard rate to default by using two hazard models- one ignoring and another allowing unobserved heterogeneity and annual shocks to the <b>hazard</b> rate. <b>Diamond</b> (1989) predicts a declining hazard rate to default due to adverse selection and moral hazard. The adverse selection effect is confirmed. After controlling for adverse selection, the hazard rate shows to be increasing over time and hence the moral hazard effect cannot be confirmed. The paper contributes also to the credit risk literature by providing a tool to gap between the immediate and long-term default probabilities...|$|R
50|$|The HMIS Color Bar {{is similar}} to the fire diamond, created by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Before 2002 the fire diamond and the color bar both had {{sections}} colored blue, red, white, and yellow. After April 2002, with the release of HMIS III, yellow in the color bar (which stood for reactivity) was replaced by orange, standing for physical <b>hazard.</b> The fire <b>diamond</b> is designed for emergencies when information about the effects of short, or acute, exposure is needed. The color bar is not for emergencies and is used to convey broader health warning information.|$|R
2500|$|The {{maritime}} <b>hazard</b> of <b>Diamond</b> Reef lies at {{the entrance}} to the East River between Governor's Island and Lower Manhattan. [...] Benjamin Maillefert was favored to win the contract based on his experience with underwater demolition and salvage. [...] He attempted in 1851 to reduce this underwater obstacle by blasting. [...] This effort was accomplished by lowering a canister of powder onto the rock at flood tide, then backing away a safe distance, detonating it with a galvanic battery. [...] However, this was not yet deemed sufficient, and another bid was undertaken a few years later. [...] Kroehl & Husted was one among five bidders. [...] The Common Council awarded the contract to H, but Mayor Fernando Wood vetoed the contract on August 7, 1855, citing that the Council did not have the authority to award contracts, since such authority resides with the Street Commissioner. [...] After appeals and new bidding, H was awarded the contract without further dispute, and proceeded to remove the underwater hazard. [...] Blasting operations continued every year, except during the winter months, until 1860.|$|R
