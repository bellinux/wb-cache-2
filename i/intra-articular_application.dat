40|$|Aim: <b>Intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of {{platelet}} rich plasma (PRP) can be {{an alternative}} treatment method for knee osteoarthritis. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the activation methods of platelet rich plasma before <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application.</b> Material and Method: A total 51 patients (76 knees) was randomly selected into two groups. In group 1, activation of PRP was managed by adding calcium chloride (CaCl). In group 2, activation of PRP was managed by keeping the solution at - 70 ° degrees for 24 hours after preparation and immersed in water at 37 oC for a period of 5 minutes for complete dissolution. Then PRP was applied. The patients were assessed with VAS and WOMAC pain scores both baseline and after 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th months of the treatment. Results: VAS and WOMAC pain scores were significantly higher at baseline compared to the results obtained at the 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th months (p= 0. 06). Following 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th months a gradual downward tendency was seen in both scores, even though no significant difference was found between the groups after 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th months. Discussion: Patients received some clinical benefits from both activation methods. There is no significant difference between activating PRP by CaCl or - 70 °C which compared in terms of clinical benefits. Therefore, blood storage at - 70 ºC may be preferred primary due to no need for additional material such as CaCl...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to assess clinical effect of local (<b>intra-articular)</b> <b>application</b> of autologous platelet-enriched plasma (PEP) in treating gonarthrosis. Materials and methods. Clinical observation of 83 women with gonarthrosis was performed within 3 months. Within 3 weeks the patients were receiving PEP intra-articular injections of 5 ml twice a week. Results. In intra-articular PEP administration in patients with gonarthrosis, the change of knee joint functional state occurs depending on the severity of osteoarthrosis, the most significant change — in the early stage and almost absent change in severe diseases (complicated by synovitis). In typical gonarthrosis of II–III radiological stages, the positive effect is short-term and observed in early one-month observation period...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately {{one-third of}} {{patients}} undergoing total hip replacement surgery require {{one to three}} units of blood postoperatively. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that has been successfully used intravenously to control bleeding after total hip replacement. A topical application is easy to administer, provides a maximum concentration of tranexamic acid at the bleeding site, and is associated {{with little or no}} systemic absorption of the tranexamic acid. Methods: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 161 patients undergoing unilateral primary total hip replacement investigated the effect of topical (<b>intra-articular)</b> <b>application</b> of tranexamic acid on blood loss. The primary outcome was the blood transfusion rate. Secondary outcomes included the drain blood loss, hemoglobin concentration drop, generic quality of life (EuroQol), Oxford Hip Score, length of stay, a cost analysis, and complications.

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of post-operative meniscus can be challenging, e.g. when {{information about the}} type of prior surgery is not provided. The type of surgery defines the post-operative meniscus appearance. The two typical surgical approaches are meniscus preserving versus non-preserving therapies. The former includes meniscal suture, glueing, needle trephination or synovial abrasion. Non-preserving therapies include partial or total meniscectomy. Accordingly, normal intrasubstance changes in the operated meniscus after preservation surgery must be differentiated from a re-tear, which is usually characterized by a linear abnormal signal intensity that is more hyperintense than seen in healing meniscus. <b>Intra-articular</b> contrast <b>application</b> may help to differentiate re-tears (where the contrast is leaking into the cleft) from healing (where granulation and scar tissue fills up the cleft and where the contrast has no space to leak in). Missing parts of the meniscus may disclose non-preserving therapy. Sharp or truncated meniscal edges and loss of substance indicate meniscectomy.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: 5 -Aminolevulinic acid based {{photodynamic}} therapy (5 -ALA-PDT) has revealed promising {{results in the}} treatment of inflammatory joint diseases due to the sensitivity of inflamed synovial tissue. For 5 -ALA-PDT to be safe and beneficial for <b>intra-articular</b> <b>applications,</b> resistance of chondrocytes is essential to prevent cartilage damage. As no data yet exist, the aim {{of the present study was}} to assess in vitro the response of the chondrocytes to 5 -ALA-PDT and to compare with osteoblasts and synovial tissue derived cells. METHODS: Bovine articular chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and synovial cells were subjected to 5 -ALA-PDT in cell culture. The PpIX accumulation and the function of the cells were assessed for up to 12 days. RESULTS: Bovine chondrocytes showed lower PpIX fluorescence upon incubation with 5 -ALA (0. 0 - 2. 0 mM) for 4 hours as compared to osteoblasts and synovial cells suggesting a low PpIX accumulation. After incubation with 0. 5 mM 5 -ALA and application of light at a dose of 20 J/cm 2, chondrocytes were functionally not affected (collagen type II and aggrecan mRNA, glycosaminoglycan synthesis) whereas a decrease in the proportion of viable cells was observed in osteoblasts and synovial cells (2 +/- 2 % and 14 +/- 8 %, respectively; chondrocytes 91 +/- 13 %). Chondrocytes showed a 58 % reduction of 5 -ALA uptake using [3 H] 5 -ALA as compared to osteoblasts and a lower mitochondrial content as assessed by the activity of the mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase (9. 2 +/- 3. 6 mU/mg protein) than osteoblasts (32. 6 +/- 10. 5 mU/mg) and synovial cells (60. 0 +/- 10. 8 mU/mg). The reduced uptake of 5 -ALA and/or the low mitochondrial content, an adaptation to their in vivo environment and the site of PpIX synthesis, presumably explains the lower PpIX content in chondrocytes and their resistance against 5 -ALA-PDT. CONCLUSION: 5 -ALA-PDT might represent a treatment strategy in inflammatory joint diseases without endangering the cartilage function. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to confirm this data in the authentic environment of chondrocytes, the articular cartilage...|$|R
40|$|External {{fixation}} for fractures of {{the distal}} radius {{has been used}} for almost 80 years. The main objective is to gain reduction and maintain the reduction throughout the treatment period. Several fixator concepts are available and selection is based on the complexity of the injury to be treated as well as the surgeon’s experience. Periarticular application of the fixator with immediate use of the wrist joint is recommended whenever possible. For <b>intra-articular</b> fractures, transarticular <b>application</b> is advisable. External fixtion in complex fractures has to be supplemented by bone grafting, fixation wires and stabilization of the radioulnar joint.

40|$|The work studied {{efficacy}} of local <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of betametason for treating juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The survey findings of 50 children locally treated with betametason {{have revealed that}} the medication has a distinct local anti inflammatory effect. The findings are based upon statistically reliable reduction of articular syndrome activity (number of painful and increasedasize joints, pain index and exudation) with all patients. Along with a local effect, betametason had a systematic antiainflammatory effect, which leads to reduced intensity or total disappearance of inflammation symptoms in non punctured joints as well, and to reliable reduction of ESR. Local application of betametason cut short nonasevere syndrome of glucocorticoids cessation with arthralgia, low grade fever, nausea, vomitus, muscular tremor, arterial hypotension, depression and asthenia. Local inta-articular introduction of betametason may be applied as a substitution therapy for patients with reduced or discontinued intake of peroral glucocorticoids, provided an active synovitis is present.

40|$|Adipose tissue {{represents}} an abundant source of stem cells. Along with anti-inflammatory effects, ASC secrete various {{factors that may}} modulate metabolism of extracellular matrix in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, suggesting {{that the presence of}} ASC could be advantageous for OA cartilage due to the recovery of homeostasis between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). To evaluate these effects, cartilage explants (CE) were cocultured with ASC for 3 and 7 days under stimulation with or without IL- 1 β. The pattern of gene expression in CE was modified by ASC, including the upregulation of COL 1 A 1 and COL 3 A 1 and the downregulation of MMP 13 and COL 10 A 1. The production of MMP- 1, MMP- 3, and MMP- 13 by ASC was not significant; moreover, cocultures with ASC reduced MMP- 13 production in CE. In conclusion, active production of TIMP- 1, TIMP- 2, TIMP- 3, IL- 6, IL- 8, and gelatinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 by ASC may be involved in the extracellular matrix remodelling, as indicated by the altered expression of collagens, the downregulated production of MMP- 13, and the reduced chondrocyte apoptosis in the cocultured CE. These data suggest that ASC modulated homeostasis of MMPs/TIMPs in degenerated OA cartilage in vitro and might be favourable in case of the <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of ASC therapy for the treatment of OA...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is to define whether intra-articular nerve growth factor (NGF), an inflammatory mediator that contributes to osteoarthritic pain, is necessary and sufficient for the development or maintenance of injury-induced facet joint pain and its concomitant spinal neuronal hyperexcitability. MethodMale Holtzman rats underwent painful cervical facet joint distraction (FJD) or sham procedures. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed in the forepaws, and NGF expression was quantified in the C 6 /C 7 facet joint. An anti-NGF antibody was administered intra-articularly in additional rats immediately or 1 day following facet distraction or sham procedures to block intra-articular NGF and test its contribution to initiation and/or maintenance of facet joint pain and spinal neuronal hyperexcitability. NGF was injected into the bilateral C 6 /C 7 facet joints in separate rats to determine if NGF alone is sufficient to induce these behavioral and neuronal responses. ResultsNGF expression increases in the cervical facet joint in association with behavioral sensitivity after that joint's mechanical injury. <b>Intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of anti-NGF immediately after a joint distraction prevents the development of both injury-induced pain and hyperexcitability of spinal neurons. Yet, intra-articular anti-NGF applied after pain has developed does not attenuate either behavioral or neuronal hyperexcitability. Intra-articular NGF administered to the facet in naïve rats also induces behavioral hypersensitivity and spinal neuronal hyperexcitability. ConclusionFindings demonstrate that NGF in the facet joint contributes to the development of injury-induced joint pain. Localized blocking of NGF signaling in the joint may provide potential treatment for joint pain...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: For the {{treatment}} of septic arthritis in large animals, the local application of antibiotics as a slow release system may be an appropriate means to reach high local bioactivity and low systemic side effects and drug residues. In this study, doxycycline microspheres were developed and tested in vitro for their drug-release properties, suitability for <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> and antimicrobial activity. METHODS: The development of a slow release system was achieved by microencapsulation of the drug into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres by a novel ultrasonic atomization method. Drug elution was evaluated from microspheres dispersed in elution medium at pre-defined time points by HPLC. Joint-tissue compatibility was tested on cultured bovine synoviocytes by evaluating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA {{and the production of}} nitric oxide (NO). Finally, the antimicrobial activity of the released antibiotic was assessed with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria exposed to release medium sampled at days 1, 7 and 12 after microsphere suspension. RESULTS: An adequate size of the microspheres, sufficient stabilization of doxycycline in aqueous environment and drug release (25 mg microspheres in 4 mL medium) above MIC for bacteria usually isolated in bovine and equine joints were obtained over 15 days. Although the cytokine mRNA expression reflected the excellent tissue compatibility, the results with NO yielded contradictory results. Antimicrobial tests of the release medium proved to match perfectly the activity of non-encapsulated, free doxycycline as reported in the literature.

40|$|Current {{research}} indicates that exogenous stem cells may accelerate reparative processes in joint disease but, no previous studies have evaluated whether bone marrow cells (BMCs) target the injured cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) in dogs. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate engraftment of BMCs following intra-articular injection in dogs with spontaneous CCL injury. Autologous PKH 26 -labelled BMCs were injected into the stifle joint of eight client-owned dogs with CCL rupture. The effects of PKH 26 staining on cell viability and PKH 26 fluorescence intensity were analysed in vitro using a MTT assay and flow cytometry. Labelled BMCs in injured CCL tissue were identified using fluorescence microscopy of biopsies harvested 3 and 13 days after intra-articular BMC injection. The intensity of PKH 26 fluorescence declines with cell division but was still detectable after 16 days. Labelling with PKH 26 had no detectable effect on cell viability or proliferation. Only rare PKH 26 -positive cells were present in biopsies of the injured CCL in 3 / 7 dogs and in synovial fluid in 1 / 7 dogs. No differences in transforming growth factor-beta 1, and interleukin- 6 before and after BMC treatment were found and no clinical complications were noted during a 1 year follow-up period. In conclusion, BMCs were shown to engraft to the injured CCL in dogs when injected into the articular cavity. <b>Intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of PKH 26 -labelled cultured mesenchymal stem cells is likely to result in higher numbers of engrafted cells that can be tracked using this method in a clinical setting...|$|E

These groups were defined as Groups L 1, L 2, L 3 and L 4 which were right shoulders administered with 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % levobupivacaine, Group C which were left shoulders as the control group and Groups S 1 and S 2 which were left shoulders administered with 0. 9 % saline. On the 2 nd and 15 th days the animals were killed, the glenohumeral joints were evaluated macroscopically then cartilage samples were taken. These samples were evaluated with Mankin score, and histomorphometrically by measuring the thickness of the cartilage between the superficial cartilage layer and the tidemark and the thickness of calcified cartilage between the tidemark and the subchondral bone. ResultsMacroscopically, on the 15 th day the joint fluid was seen to have reduced in all the groups. After microscopic evaluation, the highest Mankin score (mean: 3. 14 ± 2. 1 / 14) was in the L 4 group (15 th day 0. 5 % levobupivacaine) and was found to be statistically significant (p< 0. 05).

A new treatment option is to administer Autologous Conditioned Serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL- 1 Ra and several growth factors. The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the osteoclastic effect could be affected by <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of ACS, thus resulting in a potential decrease of knee laxity and representing a better postoperative outcome. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT-scans, whereas the clinical efficacy was assessed by patient administered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) up to two years following the ACL-reconstruction in patients receiving ACS (Group ACS) or Placebo (Group Placebo. We compared the levels and dynamics of IL- 1 b concentrations in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL- 1 b in three different post-operative periods. Bone tunnel dilatation in the first year was lower in Group ACS than in Group B. The clinical outcome (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) was consistently better in patients treated with ACS at all data points and outcome parameters and statistically significant in the WOMAC subscale stiffness after 1 year (p= 0, 047). The decrease of the IL- 1 b synovial fluid concentration appeared more pronounced in the ACS Group and values were statistically significant lower in the ACS Group at day 10 (p= 0. 038). The intraarticular application of ACS tends to result in a decrease of widening of the bone tunnel after ACL reconstructive surgery and could influence on a better postoperative result...|$|E
30|$|In fact, {{the final}} outcome could be {{influenced}} by variables related to the product, such as dose, cell content, activation method and storage procedures, as well as application modality and concomitant procedures [38]. First of all, PRP dose could be of particular importance for the outcome since it is strictly linked {{to the amount of}} growth factors and bioactive molecules administered. Both in vitro and animal studies showed a time-dependent regulation and the dose-dependency effect of PRP, suggesting that a better clinical outcome can be achieved in function of the platelet count [26, 39]. However, beside the amount of platelets, another and more debated aspect could play a major role for the <b>intra-articular</b> <b>application</b> of PRP: cell content, which is the most controversial aspect, especially with regard to the presence of leukocytes. In fact, even though leukocyte presence could contribute to an anti-microbial effect [40], some in vitro studies have shown that leukocyte rich PRP stimulates expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and enzymes detrimental for joint homeostasis [41]. Nonetheless, from a clinical point of view {{there is a lack of}} studies addressing this question with a proper methodology and, looking at the current evidence, it has not been demonstrated any significant clinical difference according to PRP formulation, with the exception of post-injective adverse events (more pain and swelling after leukocyte-rich PRP administration) [42]. Activation methods and storage procedures are also aspects under examination: in particular, activation has been demonstrated to affect the physical properties and growth factors release kinetics of PRP [43], even if no data have been reported about differences in clinical results. For what regards storage methods, a recently published in vitro trial revealed that freeze thawing is a safe procedure, which sufficiently preserves PRP quality and its ability to induce proliferation and the production of extra cellular matrix (ECM) components in both chondrocytes and synoviocytes [44]. The possibility to preserve PRP could be relevant in the clinical setting since multiple injections of PRP can be required in case of poor response or symptom relapse, and this strategy is therefore attractive: a single blood harvesting can contribute to reduce costs and patient’s discomfort. However, therapeutic protocols (i.e.: number of PRP injections and their timing) are still a controversial point, where poor evidence is available, and clinicians tend to adopt very personal approaches, mainly based to their personal experience with other injective products [38].|$|E
