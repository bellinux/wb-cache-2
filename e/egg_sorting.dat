The CVS acquired an image of egg from top view and then processed the image to extract its 1 D and 2 D size features. The features were used as input for ANN in predicting the volume of egg.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} throughput of modern egg grading machines, which grade up to 120 000 eggs per hour, the visual inspection of eggs by humans ("candling"), becomes a critical bottleneck in the <b>egg</b> <b>sorting</b> chain. In order to assure a high and consistent egg quality, researchers investigated the use of modern sensor technologies to replace the candling operation. During the last decades, several types of sensors were developed, and {{it is believed that}} these sensors will replace human candling in the near future. A first class of sensors is based on mechanical techniques and allows investigation of the physical shell quality, such as the presence of cracks and shell strength. A second class is based upon spectroscopic principles and allows the operator to "see" through the egg shell {{in order to determine the}} internal quality of the eggs, such as albumen pH and viscosity and the presence of inclusions such as blood and meat spots. A third class of sensors aims at mimicking the human eye by means of a camera and a software platform ("computer vision").

Embryos of resting eggs of Penilia avirostris developed comparatively slowly (hatching after 86 days of incubation), with a hatching rate of only 5 %.

Eggs were analyzed and sorted according to forward angle and 90 ° light scatter, flow cytometric parameters that are relative measures of object size and granularity, respectively. Mature eggs containing vermiform juveniles were less granular and slightly larger than eggs in earlier stages of embryogeny, allowing for separation of mature eggs from immature eggs.

The hatchlings occurred mainly in September, when we registered the lowest hydrologic level of Paraná river (2. 40 m). Grimaldina brazzai presented the longest time for hatchling,  44 days; and Brachionus dolabratus and B. falcatus, the shortest time, 2 days.

This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of small-scale poultry production to contribute to household food security in the Maphephetheni lowlands in KwaZulu-Natal. Forty households, selected by stratified random sampling (eight households per sub-ward) participated in a trial to assess the feasibility of egg and broiler production, from commercial lines, {{and the potential for}} generating income to improve household food security. The study established that participating households acquired the necessary skills through a training module offered, actively engaged in poultry production and marketing of the produce, and managed their funds well. Market demand for poultry products in the Maphephetheni lowlands was high from both local consumers and traders. Egg production profit was constrained as <b>eggs</b> were not <b>sorted</b> into sizes according to South African standards and local selling prices, but, contrary to commercial market practice, the eggs are graded ‘standard’ regardless of size. Both egg and broiler production are technically feasible in Maphephetheni lowlands, but broiler production is more economically viable than eggs and more highly desired by households. Households reported that poultry production could provide much needed income and reduce poverty and hunger in their community. Although household dietary diversity did not improve, income increased and was put into a savings account. Households borrowed and used this money for various needs, but not necessarily to supplement their diets. Commercial point-of-lay pullets and three-week old vaccinated broilers could be used in the Maphephetheni lowlands, but broilers were more commercially viable than point-of-lay pullets.

The hatched larvae can be　reared as far as the yolk have been consumed, but even at this stage, some of　them are still remain unidentifiable. 　The pelagic fish eggs can be divided into the agglutinated pelagic eggs and　isolated ones. The characteristics of both of these groups are as follows :　Agglutinated pelagic eggs. The eggs are spawned either imbedded in a　gelatinous ribbon or balloon, or they are agglutinated to each other forming an　egg mass without gelatinous substance. 　Isolated pelagic eggs. The spawned eggs are isolated, not forming any　mass. 　The following characteristics are especially important to identify the pelagic　eggs. 　Egg size and shape. The diameter of the pelagic eggs is ranging from　 0. 5 to 4. 8 mm, mostly 0. 7 - 1. 5 mm. Most of the pelagic eggs are spherical in　shape, but some of them are ellipsoidal or in other shape. 　Egg membrane. Usually colorless, thin, without any markings, but some　have double membrane, coated membrane or membrane with various markings　or appendages (Pl. 1, figs. 5, 7, 8, 9, & 11). 　Perivitelline space is usually narrow, but sometimes considerablly wide. 　Yolk is mostly colorless and homogeneous, but some have segmented yolk. 　Oil globule. The pelagic eggs can be divided into three groups according　to the absence or presence of an oil globule or oil globules. Coloration, position　as well as the number of oil globule must be examined, together with their　changes during the course of <b>egg</b> development. 　Pigmentation. <b>Sorts</b> and distribution of pigments, time and location of their　occurrence and their changes during the egg development are also important. 　Hatching pore. Some eggs have special form in hatching pore. 　In the hatched larvae, the shape of the yolk, the position of oil globule, the　nutnber of myotomes, the position of the anus and its shifting, the nature of　the marginal fin, pigmentations, dorsal and ventral fins (if present), and the　changes of all these characteristics during the larval development arc indispensable　for {{the identification of}} species. 魚類の初期生活史の研究には,卵およびそれから孵化した仔魚の性質を明らかにすることが必要であるのは云うまでもない. 海産の硬骨魚の多くが浮性卵を産み,しかもそれらは容易に採集されるが,種名ないしは所属の判明しないものが多い. 我国における浮游性魚卵の研究は 19 世紀の末から行なわれ,神谷(1916 ～ 1925) によつてその当時までの知識がまとめられ, 50 種の記載と 53 種についての検索が示された・その後にも浮游性魚卵の研究はかなり行なわれているが断片的なものが多く,それらをまとめた業績は見当らない. 筆者は 1951 年から九州近海に出現する浮性魚卵の採集研究を行い,現在までに 200 余種を得ている. しかし,当然出現することが期待される種類はなお非常に多く,今後更に研究を続行する必要が痛感される. 最近水産資源調査研究の一部として,産卵調査が各地で行われ,神谷以後の知識の整理が必要になつて来た. この報告では浮游性魚卵およびそれから孵出した仔魚の種の同定について解説する. なお本研究に当り終始御指導下さつた内川恵太郎前教授に謹んで感謝の意を表する...|$|R

Nuclear staining** In order to visualize the morphological structures of the larvae, cell nuclei were stained either with TOTO- 3 iodide or with SYTOX Green. 1. Incubate stained (IHC / FISH) larvae overnight at room temperature in TOTO- 3 iodide or SYTOX Green working solution. - Wash larvae 3 × 5 min in PBST. - Transfer larvae to 80 % glycerol in PBS and image as soon as possible. **IV. Mounting** Before mounting, larvae should have spent at least six hours in 80 % glycerol in PBS, in order to be completely equilibrated. Melt mounting media in water bath and maintain liquid in 40 degree Celsius heating block or water bath. Larvae are mounted in a sandwich of one large cover slip (24 × 60 mm; used as “slide”) and a small coverslip (18 × 18 mm), with medium sized coverslips (22 × 22 mm) used as spacers. The sandwich is prepared by gluing with cyanoacrylate glue two stacks of small cover slips on one large cover slip at about 8 – 10 mm distance between the two stacks (Fig. 1). In general, three spacer cover slips (total thickness of 3 × 160 micrometer) are sufficient for two to four day old larvae. The spacers should generate a space thicker than the larvae to be mounted in order to avoid squeezing of the fixed tissue, which can cause deformations or damaged / torn tissue. 1. Put a single larva in an hourglass with some 80 % glycerol in PBS. - With two hollow needles, remove the yolk and cut off the tail (helps to keep the larva in place when mounted). - Transfer larva with the tip of a hollow needle to a cover slip (24 × 60 mm) prepared with cover-slip spacer stacks. - Fill the area between the spacers with liquid warm mounting medium. - With the help of the hollow needles, orient the larva into the right position. - Place a small cover slip (18 × 18 mm) on the spacers and confirm that the embryo is not shifted using a dissecting microscope. The agarose solidifies. - Fix the chamber by applying spots of nail polish (Fig. 1). - Incubate mounted larva overnight in the dark in a humid chamber at room temperature to let it equilibrate (This is very important and can significantly improve the quality of the TOTO- 3 nuclear stain as it might also equilibrate the nuclear staining.) **V. Microscope setup and confocal imaging** 1. For imaging place the cover slip sandwich with the mounted larva into the custom made aluminum frame (Fig. 2). - Fix the cover slip sandwich in the aluminum frame with modeling clay (Fig. 2). (This set up allows easy handling of the sample when it comes to turning around the cover slip to record a stack from the opposing side, here the ventral side). - Mount the aluminum frame on the microscope stage. - Perform recording of stacks in the first scan position (dorsal anterior part of the head); for high dynamic range imaging, record two stacks at different laser intensities; optimize laser for first stack such that all signal is in linear range, and for second stack such that signal deep in the brain is best. The depth in z-direction should be sufficient to cover most of the ventral brain. - Perform recording of stacks in the second scan position (dorsal posterior part of the head). The imaged volume has to overlap with the first position by about 20 % to enable correct stitching. Same z-stack depth and laser settings as for first position. - Manually turn the sample coverslip sandwich fixed in the aluminum fame upside-down to record the ventral side. - Perform recording of stacks in the third scan position (ventral anterior part of the head), same laser settings as for first position. - Perform recording of stacks in the fourth scan position (ventral rostral part of the head), same laser settings as for first position. High dynamic range is obtained by recording each staining, the specific stain as well as the nuclear stain, with two intensities for every side (dorsal and ventral) and part (frontal and rostral) scanned, ending up with four channels per scan. The two intensities are individually adjusted once per larva with the first scan and kept equal for all the following scans. The low intensity is recorded first to minimize bleaching and is set in a way that no overexposure occurred, whereas the high intensity is set in a way that structures deep in the brain are fairly visible independent of how strongly the surface structures are overexposed.

Multiview resonstruction, stitching, and attenuation correction** The recorded stacks are further processed using the ViBE-Z software package through a web interface ([URL] 1. Recorded stacks are imported into ImageJ ([URL] using the import plugin appropriate for the confocal microscope brand type software. - Install the HDF 5 data format plugin in ImageJ ([URL] - Save stacks in HDF 5 format. - Create account at “[URL] Upload files and follow instructions for processing at this site. ### Timing - Day 1 cross fish - Day 2 collect <b>eggs</b> and <b>sort</b> embryos - Day 3 larvae are 24 hours old - Day 4 larvae are 48 hours old - Day 5 larvae are 72 hours old, fix embryos over night (most recordings were done with 72 hours old larvae) - Day 6 stop fixation, dehydrate, wait at least one hour before rehydration (better: start on the next day) - Days 7 – 9 in situ staining or immunostaining - Day 9 nuclear staining - Day 10 stop nuclear staining, larvae into glycerol, wait six hours and mount - Day 11 record larvae (approximately four hours per larva) - Day 12 data processing ### Troubleshooting - Weak FISH or IHC staining: - Embryos should be fixed as freshly as possible. - The proteinase K digest is a crucial step in both IIA and B protocols and may always be a step worth to be optimized if problems occur, especially for older larvae. - Always make sure, all solutions are carefully prepared and probes / antibodies are working. - High background in WISH - Can be reduced by optimizing the probe concentration {{as well as with the}} hybridization water bath temperature (higher temperature lead to a more stringent environment and might therefore lower the background). - High background in the IHC - Might be decreased by reducing the antibody concentration. - A weak or uneven nuclear staining - Can be caused by a short staining time. It is important, especially in older larvae, that the staining is performed overnight, as the stain needs to diffuse evenly deep into tissue. It turned out that a longer staining time also enhances the signal to noise ratio (lower apparent background), as there is less stain visible in the cytoplasm and the nuclei become more clearly visible. This may be caused by TOTO 3 binding equilibrium to DNA versus double stranded RNA. The nuclear stain however also diffuses over time out of the samples, thus it is suggested to do the imaging as soon as possible after the stain is complete. - It is not recommended to increase the concentration of the staining working solutions, as this increases the background rather than improving the staining quality. - Bleaching - If too much bleaching occurs during imaging, the staining may be too weak and a fresh staining might be necessary. Bleaching may be reduced if multiple imaging is avoided. Recording the low channels first is also highly recommended. It might also be helpful to check that the intensities are as low as possible. - Avoid optimizing recording settings on the same embryo that you take stacks, which may cause bleached planes in the stack data. Usually within an identically treated batch larvae are fairly similar in stain intensity, and some larvae should be sacrificed to find the optimized scan setting, which are then applied to a fresh larva. - Orientation of larva in mounting medium - Images of zebrafish are typically displayed thus that anterior points to the left and posterior to the right. It can be helpful to mount a larva in a way that it will automatically be recorded pointing into the right direction. This depends on the microscope setup as well as on the microscope software. Thus, depending on these two factors, the axis along which a larva is mounted as well as the direction can vary. - Problems with data processing using the ViBE-Z web-interface - It is important for the registration that embryos are not damaged, deformed or squeezed. To avoid damaged tissue, embryos should be as freshly fixed as possible, because long storage times can lead to artifacts in the tissue. Staining and mounting should be performed as gently as possible. If any squeezing occurs, use more spacer cover slips for mounting. For the correct stitching of the dorsal and ventral side data stacks, it is important to scan as far through the sample...|$|R
