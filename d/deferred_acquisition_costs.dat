50|$|<b>Deferred</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Costs</b> (DAC) {{is a term}} {{commonly}} used in the insurance business. It describes the practice of deferring the cost of acquiring a new customer over {{the duration of the}} insurance contract. Insurance companies face large upfront costs incurred in issuing new business, such as commissions to sales agents, underwriting, bonus interest and other acquisition expenses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferred</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Costs</b> (DAC) {{represents}} the “un-recovered investment” in the policies issued {{and are therefore}} capitalized as an intangible asset to match costs with related revenues. Over time the acquisition costs are recognized as an expense that reduces the DAC asset. The process of recognizing the costs in the income statement is known as amortization and refers to the DAC asset being amortized, or reduced {{over a number of}} years.|$|E
50|$|Accrual {{accounting}} and deferring implies timewise matching(synchronization) {{of income and}} expenses: an incurred cost is capitalized and does not become an expense until it is recognized in the financial statements of the company. In an accounting sense, it is the amortization of that cost, and not the original cost itself, that becomes the expense. Hence, certain costs which are incurred to acquire insurance contracts should not be recognized as an expense in the accounting period {{in which they are}} incurred but should be capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually amortized over the lifetime of the insurance contracts. Such costs are called Deferred Acquisition Expenses (DAE) and capitalization of DAE results in setting up of an asset called <b>Deferred</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Costs</b> (DAC).|$|E

40|$|Generalized Linear Model Approach to Adjusting Expected Assumptions of Long-Term Care Incidence Rates Rozita Ramli, PhD University of Connecticut, 2016 Actuarial {{assumptions}} {{are needed in}} most of actuarial works, for example pricing and reserving and setting capital standards. In long-term care (LTC) insurance, three main actuarial {{assumptions are}} incidence, termination and utilization rates. These assumptions {{can be seen as}} factors affecting the financial progress in LTC insurance business. Insurance companies must make sure the assumptions they use adequately reflect actual experience to avoid adverse financial consequences. Hence, a regular systematic methodology to monitor expected assumptions is essential. This work proposes a methodology to adjusting expected assumptions of LTC incidence rates. The methodology uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach in modeling incidence rates and the adjustment is parallel to an established industry technique of stochastic <b>deferred</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> (DAC) unlocking. The methodology uses confidence intervals as a decision tool to decide if any adjustment is needed. We also bring in a credibility component into the methodology to provide rationalization for choosing the appropriate significant level of the confidence interval when applying the methodology. Lastly we study the effect of size of historical experience used in the adjustment on the efficiency of the methodology. Similar to how the stochastic DAC unlocking technique is an acceptable technique by regulators and practitioners, we foresee our GLM methodology to be accepted as a basis for adjusting assumptions under Principle-Based Reserving in the future...|$|R
50|$|This {{presentation}} of net income is prohibited by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, arbiters of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the United States. In GAAP, marketing expenses may be accrued {{in some situations}} as prepaid expenses, but only amortized in special cases. <b>Deferred</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> are typically only allowed for amortizing the acquisition costs of customers in businesses like insurance, where the amortization occurs over the well-defined duration of a contract. ACSOI can be a useful internal metric for businesses to determine financial performance and to make strategic management decisions, if they believe their subscriber acquisition costs are an up-front cash outlay that truly builds long-term customer assets commensurate with that outlay. A main argument for not using this metric in GAAP accounting {{is that there is}} a key difference between subscribers and customers: customers make purchases and generate revenue for the business; it may be faulty to assume that all subscriber acquisition costs can be amortized as assets if only an unknown portion of the acquired subscribers will actually convert to customers.|$|E

40|$|IFRS {{standards}} are getting acceptance {{day by day}} rapidly in all over the world. It is because IFRSs are the global and common language, which are more transparent and comparable for the investors and users residing in different nations. IFRSs are mandatory for all companies listed in capital market within EU {{from the beginning of}} 2005. As a member state of EU, Swedish banks also adopted mandatory IFRS from 1 January 2005. However, the banks were already implementing IFRS to some extent as most of the standards in SGAAP (Swedish Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) were already directly translated from IAS. After mandatory period, the banks adopted all new, updated and revised standards in accordance with EU recommendations. Nevertheless, there are little or no material effects of adoption of IFRS standards except some particular standards. Such particular {{standards are}}: IFRS 3, IAS 39, IAS 27, EU Occupational Pension Directive, IAS 32, and <b>Deferred</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Cost.</b> And the main differences between IFRS and SGAAP are IAS 1, IFRS 3, financial assets, financial instruments, intangible assets, hedge accounting and tax driven. But, the Swedish GAAP no longer exists now for the companies listed in capital market as mandatory IFRS is into force. Furthermore, I examined transparency & accounting quality, information environment, and cost of equity capital of four sample banks after mandatory IFRS adoption. But, I find the level of transparency and financial reporting quality has not been increased over the years. Regarding accounting quality, I also examined earning management, loss recognition, and value relevance. I find little evidence of less earning management, and find unclear evidence regarding loss recognition and value relevance. In other word, I find little evidence of increased accounting quality, although Sweden is a country with strong regulatory enforcements. Moreover, I also find little evidence of improved information environment but find information cost increased; although I find lower information risks after mandatory IFRS adoption. I, however, find lower cost of equity capital after mandatory IFRS adoption because for banks it will be easy to reach wider investors communities residing in different nations. Nevertheless, the evident advantage of IFRS is that the capital market can use information based on common rules...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{introduction}} of a consumption-based corporate income tax in the European Union. Our proposal would guarantee neutrality regarding investment decisions {{and at the same time}} increase cost-efficiency. The proposal is based on the S-base cash flow tax, where transactions within the corporate sector are not at all taxable and only transactions be-tween shareholders and corporations are subject to tax. In contrast to existing S-base cash flow tax systems, tax deductibility of investments is <b>deferred.</b> Rather, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> and capital endowments are compounded at the capital market rate and are set off against fu-ture capital gains. Dividends and withdrawals are fully taxable at the shareholder level. Be-cause of the similarities to the Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) tax our proposal is called Allowance for Shareholder Equity (ASE tax). The ASE tax exhibits the same neutrality properties as the traditional cash flow tax. More-over, the compounded inter-temporal credit method ensures that it is neutral with respect to the decision between domestic and foreign investment. To increase acceptance of the ASE tax, current taxpayers' documentation requirements will be reduced rather than extended. Our proposal is shaped in a way that it could be realized in a single EU country or in all member states of the EU. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{initiatives}} {{to protect and}} restore valued species and communities in human-dominated landscapes face huge challenges linked {{to the cost of}} acquiring habitat. We ask how the sale of forest carbon offsets could reduce land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs,</b> and how the alternate goals of maximizing a or b-diversity in focal communities could affect the prioritization land parcels over a range of conservation targets. Maximizing total carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential reduced land <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> by up to 48 %. Maximizing b rather than a-diversity within forest and savannah bird communities reduced <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> by up to 15 %, and when these solutions included potential carbon credit revenues, <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> reductions up to 32 % were achieved. However, the total cost of conservation networks increased exponentially as area targets increased in all scenarios. Our results indicate that carbon credit sales have the potential to enhance conservation outcomes in human-dominated landscapes by reducing the net <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> of land conservation in old and maturing forests essential for the persistence of old forest plant and animal communities. Maximizing b versus a-diversity may further reduce costs by reducing the total area required to meet conservation targets and enhancing landscape heterogeneity. Although the potential value of carbon credit sales declined as a fraction of total <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs,</b> even conservative scenarios using a carbon credit value of $ 12. 5 /T suggest reductions in <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> of up to $ 235 M, indicating that carbon credit sales could substantially reduce the costs of conservation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients' non-adherence to {{drug therapy}} {{is a major}} problem for society as it is {{associated}} with reduced health outcomes. Generally, approximately only 50 % of patients with chronic disease in developed countries adhere to prescribed therapy, and the most common non-adherence refers to chronic under-use, i. e. patients use less medication than prescribed or prematurely stop the therapy. Patients' non-adherence leads to high additional costs for society in terms of poor health. Non-adherence is also related to the unnecessary sale of drugs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence to drug therapy in a national population. Methods We constructed a model of the drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence to drug therapy based on patient register data of dispensed out-patient prescriptions in the entire Swedish population during a 12 -month period. In the model, the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> was successively adjusted for the assumed different rates of primary non-adherence (prescriptions not being filled by the patient), and secondary non-adherence (medication not being taken as prescribed) according to the patient's age, therapies, and the number of dispensed drugs per patient. Results With an assumption of a general primary non-adherence rate of 3 %, and a general secondary non-adherence rate of 50 %, for all types of drugs, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 11. 2 billion (€ 1. 2 billion), or 48. 5 % of total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> in Sweden 2006. With the assumption of varying primary non-adherence rates for different age groups and different secondary non-adherence rates for varying types of drug therapies, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 9. 3 billion (€ 1. 0 billion), or 40. 2 % of the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> When the assumption of varying primary and secondary non-adherence rates for a different number of dispensed drugs per patient was added to the model, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> related to non-adherence totalled SEK 9. 9 billion (€ 1. 1 billion), or 42. 6 % of the total drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> Conclusions Our estimate indicates that drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> related to non-adherence represent a substantial proportion of the economic resources in the health care sector. A low rate of primary non-adherence, combined with a high rate of secondary non-adherence, contributes to a large degree of unnecessary medical spending. Thus, efforts of different types of interventions are needed to improve secondary adherence. </p...|$|R
