2500|$|In 1994, a study {{conducted}} by the University of California in which <b>fifth</b> <b>graders</b> played extensive hours of video games, they managed to gain better spatial skills. [...] The children were split into two groups, with the experimental group playing Marble Madness, while the control group played Conjecture. [...] The distinction is important because Marble Madness requires spatial skills while Conjecture does not. [...] The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population. [...] The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days. [...] Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for spatial ability, on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing Marble Madness significantly increased spatial ability, especially in the children who had low performance on the spatial ability pre-test. [...] Conversely, playing Conjecture did not increase children's spatial skills. [...] This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present. [...] It is unknown if these increases in spatial ability persist into the long-term. [...] This could mean that any benefits to practicing may only last if practice sessions are done at least intermittently.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, a {{longitudinal}} study conducted in Japan assessed possible long-term effects of video game playing in children. The final analysis consisted of 591 <b>fifth</b> <b>graders</b> aged 10–11 across eight public elementary schools, and was conducted {{over the course of}} a year. [...] Initially, children were asked to complete a survey which assessed presence or absence of violence in the children's favorite video games, as well as video game context variables that may affect the results and the aggression levels of the children. [...] Children were assessed again for these variables a year later. [...] Results reveal that there is a significant difference in gender, with boys showing significantly more aggressive behavior and anger than girls, which was attributed by the authors to boys elevated interest in violent video games. [...] However the interaction between time spent gaming and preference for violent games was associated with reduced aggression in boys but not girls. [...] The researchers also found that eight context variables they assessed increased aggression, including unjustified violence, availability of weapons, and rewards. Three context variables, role-playing, extent of violence, and humor, were associated with decreased aggression. [...] It is unknown if the observed changes from the two surveys are actually contextual effects. [...] The researchers found that the context and quality of the violence in video games affects children more than simply presence and amount of violence, and these effects are different from child to child.|$|E
