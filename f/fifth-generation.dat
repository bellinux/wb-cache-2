5|$|In the mid-1990s, the United Arab Emirates {{evaluated}} the Su-27M, but later acquired the Mirage 2000 {{due to the}} country's close relationship with France. In 2015, its officials entered into negotiations with their Russian counterparts about the possible contract for the modernized Su-35. In February 2017, the country signed a preliminary agreement {{for the purchase of}} a number of Su-35s, later reported to be 24, and also signed an agreement with Rostec, Russia's state-owned corporation responsible for the development of advanced industrial products, to develop a <b>fifth-generation</b> aircraft based on the MiG-29.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a <b>fifth-generation</b> fighter that is {{considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner began {{development}} after the positive reception of Shin Megami Tensei If.... Designed {{from the outset}} as a spin-off from the main Megami Tensei series, it drew on elements of detective fiction. It was also the series' first appearance on <b>fifth-generation</b> home consoles. Regular Megami Tensei staff were involved with the project, including director Kouji Okada, writer Ryutaro Ito, and character designer Kazuma Kaneko. The music was composed by Toshiko Tasaki and Tsukasa Masuko. Upon its release in Japan, the original version garnered positive reviews from Japanese press and strong sales. It went on to spawn both a television series and multiple sequels.|$|E
5|$|Kennywood Entertainment, {{itself an}} {{operator}} of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies {{to purchase the}} group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the Six Flags franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new owners would make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment {{announced that it would}} sell its parks to the Madrid-based amusement company, Parques Reunidos. The fourth- and <b>fifth-generation</b> family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the <b>fifth-generation</b> iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the Old Hat Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a <b>fifth-generation</b> descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster, a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E
5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. <b>Fifth-generation</b> descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|With {{the need}} to update Russia's ageing fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started {{integrating}} glass cockpits and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate {{a greater variety of}} weapons) to existing air force aircraft. The Su-27SM, as the modified aircraft is called, made its first flight in December 2002. The initial success of this project led Sukhoi in December 2003 to proceed with a follow-up modernization programme. Known internally as T-10BM, the programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of the airframe to narrow the qualitative gap between Russian aircraft and foreign so-called fourth-generation aircraft. The resultant design, also designated Su-35, would serve as an interim solution pending the introduction of the Sukhoi Su-57 <b>fifth-generation</b> fighter, many features of which the aircraft would incorporate. Additionally, the aircraft was to be a single-seat alternative to the two-seat design of the Su-30MK on the export market.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner was {{the first}} Megami Tensei title to be {{released}} on a 32-bit <b>fifth-generation</b> home video game console, and the first Megami Tensei game to feature 3D graphics. The latter presented a new challenge for the development team: while they found adjusting to the new specifications a challenge, they also greatly enjoyed working with the Sega Saturn, the which was unlike anything previously experienced by the team. Among the design staff were Katsura Hashino, who focused on combat, and Shogo Isogai, who focused on coordination between gameplay events. The demon conversation system was conceived by Okada based on experiences with the multiple accents encountered in the Kansai region of Japan. Using this as a base, he created the response system to give demon negotiation a more realistic feeling than previous Megami Tensei games. It was also a means of equalizing the relationship between demons and the player party, which had previously been more akin to master and servant than equal partners. The Zoma demons, which could be freely tailored into different demon types, was created while the team was balancing out the game's difficulty. The gameplay difficulty, which by later standards would be considered quite high, was toned down from the difficulty of earlier Megami Tensei titles {{to appeal to a}} wider audience. This necessitated balancing a more forgiving difficulty with keeping traditional Megami Tensei gameplay elements.|$|E

The line initially {{consisted of the}} ES 350 sedan, which as per previous models, featured front-wheel drive and a V6 engine—now displacing 3.5 liters. The line was refreshed in 2009, during which more features were added, and a four-cylinder variant, the ES 240, was introduced for Asian markets. The <b>fifth-generation</b> ES remained Lexus' top-selling sedan model in the North American and Asian markets, anchoring the marque's entry-level model lineup.
