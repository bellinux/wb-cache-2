5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

40|$|Mahler’s {{music has}} been used in over 130 films and {{television}} programmes. This appropriation generally falls into three categories: a) usage that apparently has no intentional regard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music’s</b> cultural origins or significance; b) usage that does have intentional regard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music’s</b> cultural origins or significance; and c) usage that has intentional regard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>music’s</b> previous screen application. Distinctions between these categories are blurred by unpredictable differences in viewer competence and perceptual/emotional response, and by the interpretative inclinations of the critic. This paper explores ways in which the use of Mahler’s music on screen either trades—directly or more tenuously—on its inherited meanings, or reveals hitherto unsuspected semantic possibilities. Calling on a range of commercial and non-commercial screen repertoire from a variety of periods, the paper questions whether there are any aesthetic, cultural or technical limits to such acts of re-contextualization and translation of Mahler’s music...|$|R

John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
