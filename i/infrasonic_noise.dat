40|$|Introduction: The {{agricultural}} tractor {{is one of}} the most commonly used vehicles on farms and one of the most prominent sources of noise. This article presents an exemplary assessment of the audible and <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> levels in the cabins of selected modern wheeled {{agricultural tractor}}s. Materials and Methods: Operator-perceived audible and <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> levels in the cabins were examined for 20 types of modern tractors during typical conditions of work. The tractors had been in use for no longer than 3 years, with rated power between 96 kW and 227 kW, designed and produced by world-renowned companies. Noise level measurements were performed in accordance with PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 (ISO 9612 : 2009). Results: Audible noise levels (A-weighted) ranged from 62. 1 to 87. 4 dB-A (average: 68. 2 to 83. 8 dB-A) for different work tasks. The factors influencing noise levels include performed tasks, soil, weather conditions and the skills of individual drivers. In spectrum analysis, the highest noise levels occurred at frequencies 250 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz. Infrasound noise levels (G-weighted) ranged from 87. 3 to 111. 3 dB-G. The driver-experienced exposure to infrasound was found to increase significantly when the vehicle was in motion. Conclusions: Average audible noise levels have no potential to adversely affect the hearing organ during tasks performed inside the closed cabins of the analysed modern agricultural tractors. Due to the relatively low audible noise levels inside the cabins of modern agricultural tractors, non-auditory effects are the only adverse symptoms that can develop. Modern agricultural tractors emit considerable <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> levels. All tractors introduced into the market should be subjected to tests with regard to <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{occupational}} noise and hearing survey (ONHS) was begun in 1968 by the U. S. Public Health Service as a long-range project {{of what was}} then called the National. Noise Study, with operations based at the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati, Ohio. With {{the creation of the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in December 1970, the survey program was continued by the Noise Section of the NIOSH Physical Agents Branch. An {{occupational noise}} and hearing survey was made to characterize noise-exposure levels in a variety of industries, to describe the hearing status of workers exposed to such noise conditions, and to attempt to establish a relationship between occupational noise level and hearing loss that would be applicable to general industry. The four types of data collected during a typical survey at a given individual plant included noise measurements, background personal- occupational information, medical and otologic data, and audiometric data. The relationship between hearing-loss-risk and noise level has been roughly defined for employees who work eight hours a day in relatively simple, or "ordinary" noise environments. The effects of fluctuating levels, quiet rest periods, shortened exposures at higher levels, administrative controls, ear protectors, impact or impulsive noise, lengthened exposure, seasonal exposures, high frequency <b>noise,</b> and <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noises</b> could not be quantified without further research and evaluation. Additional work is indicated to enhance the effectiveness of audiometric monitoring and noise-measurement techniques, and to develop better indicators and citeria for hearing loss.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to study {{the life cycle of}} a SSW using <b>infrasonic</b> ambient <b>noise</b> observations. The potential of infrasound is shown to provide the missing observations required by numerical weather prediction to better resolve the upper atmosphere. The 2009 major SSW is reanalyzed using the Evers and Siegmund (2009) data set. Microbarom observations are evaluated to identify detections that cannot be explained by the analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Identified differences can be related to either the altitude limit of the analysis, not resolving thermospheric ducts, or to an actual error in the analysis. Therefore, a first-order model is used to relate observations with the analysis, existing of the Waxler et al. (2007) microbarom source model, including bathymetry to allow column resonances, and an atmospheric propagation model using 3 -D ray tracing. Daily normalized spectral powers are proposed to distinguish stratospheric from thermospheric return height, based on the different signature of solar tidal amplitude fluctuations. It is shown that a SSW is not a smooth event as following from the analysis but a series of abrupt changes with a period of 10 to 16 days, increasing in intensity and duration. This is in agreement with the wave period of Rossby waves, interacting with the stratospheric circumpolar vortex. The type of vortex disturbance, split or reversal, can be deduced from the combined effect of the change in back-azimuth direction, solar tidal signature type, and/or phase variation of the amplitude variation of the observed microbaroms.

40|$|Introduction and {{objectives}} Although exposure to audible noise has been examined in many publications, {{the sources of}} infrasound in agriculture have not been fully examined and presented. The study presents the assessment of exposure to infrasound from many sources at workplaces in agriculture with examples of possible ergonomic and health consequences caused by such exposure. Material and Methods Workers’-perceived <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> levels were examined for 118 examples of moving and stationary agricultural machines (modern and old cab-type tractors, old tractors without cabins, small tractors, grinders, chargers, forage mixers, grain cleaners, conveyors, bark sorters and combine-harvesters). Measurements of infrasound were taken {{with the use of}} class 1 instruments (digital sound analyzer DSA- 50 digital and acoustic calibrator). Noise level measurements were performed in accordance with PN-Z- 01338 : 2010, PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 and ISO 9612 : 2009. Results and conclusions The most intense sources of infrasound in the study were modern and old large size types agricultural machinery (tractors, chargers and combined-harvesters, and stationary forage mixers with ventilation). The G-weighted infrasound levels were significant and at many analyzed workplaces stayed within or exceeded the occupational exposure limit (L G eq, 8 h = 102 dB) when the duration of exposure is longer than 22 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – modern cab-type tractors), 46 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old type cab-tractors), 73 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old tractors without cabins), 86 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – combine-harvesters) and 156 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – stationary forage mixers with ventilation). All measured machines generated <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> exceeded the value L G eq, Te = 86 dB (occupational exposure limit for workplaces requiring maintained mental concentration). A very important harmful factor is infrasound exposure for pregnant women and adolescents at workplaces in agriculture. Very valuable work can be technical limiting exposure to infrasound from new and used agricultural machinery. The technical limitation of infrasound caused by both old and new agricultural machinery can be invaluable from the work point of view...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A four-element, 1 -km-aperture seismo-acoustic array {{has been}} {{designed}} and installed northeast of Seoul, Korea. Each element of the array consists of a GS- 13 vertical seismometer (1 Hz) in a shallow borehole (10 m) and a low-frequency acoustic gauge connected to an 11 -element hose array (7. 6 -m hoses) at the surface. The array {{is being used to}} assess the importance of colocated seismic and acoustic sensors for the purposes of (1) quantifying wind as a source of seismic and acoustic noise, (2) constraining propagation path effects in the atmosphere and solid earth, (3) locating the sources of the waves, and (4) characterizing the source type. Seismic noise estimates illustrate a level that is only slightly above the low-noise model on average. Acoustic noise levels resolve the microbaroms during low-noise times but document a nearly 50 -dB increase in noise during the windiest periods. <b>Infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> in the 0. 01 - to 5 -Hz band increases rapidly with wind velocity. The seismic noise shows little or no dependence on wind velocity. Analysis of the data from a 2 -month time period suggests that there are many more acoustic signals than seismic (4 – 10 times as many). Approximately 1 / 4 of all seismic signals are associated wit...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{coherence}} structure of 30 infrasound array detections, with source-to-receiver ranges of 25 – 6500 km, has been measured within the 0. 25 – 1 Hz passband. The data were recorded at International Monitoring System (IMS) microbarograph arrays with apertures of between 1 and 4 km. Such array detections {{are of interest}} for Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty monitoring. The majority of array detections (e. g. 80 per cent of recordings in the third-octave passband centred on 0. 63 Hz) exhibit {{spatial coherence}} loss anisotropy {{that is consistent with}} previous lower frequency atmospheric acoustic studies; coherence loss is more rapid perpendicular to the acoustic propagation direction than parallel to it. The thirty array detections display significant interdetection variation in the magnitude of spatial coherence loss. The measurements {{can be explained by the}} simultaneous arrival of wave fronts at the recording array with angular beamwidths of between 0. 4 and 7 ◦ and velocity bandwidths of between 2 and 40 m s− 1. There is a statistically significant positive correlation between source-to-receiver range and the magnitude of coherence loss. Acoustic multipathing generated by interactions with fine-scale wind and temperature gradients along stratospheric propagation paths is qualitatively consistent with the observations. In addition, the study indicates that to isolate coherence loss generated by propagation effects, analysis of signals exhibiting high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) is required (SNR 2 > 11 in this study). The rapid temporal variations in <b>infrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> observed in recordings at IMS arrays indicates that correcting measured coherence values for the effect of noise, using pre-signal estimates of noise power, is ineffective.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since 2009 the Seehore {{test site}} is {{operative}} within the MonterosaSki resort in Aosta Valley (NW Italy). This real scale test site {{was intended to}} study the dynamics of small/medium ava-lanches, the avalanche release processes and the interaction between avalanche flows and obstacles. From 2570 to 2300 m asl, the slope presents a NNW aspect, a mean inclination of about 28 ° and it is instrumented with a galvanized steel obstacle to measure avalanche impact forces and their effects on it. Though most of the avalanches are artificially triggered on a routine basis to secure the ski-runs of MonterosaSki resort, the system records also natural events. In case of avalanche release, the ero-sion/deposition mass and the front velocity are evaluated by laser scan measurements and photo-grammetry. Avalanche outline is recorded by using GPS devices coupled with snow depth, density and granulometry measurements. In the release zone, snowpack properties and release features are recorded by field surveys. A specific survey is done for the snow deposited around the obstacle. Since Summer 2012, a high sensitive low <b>noise</b> <b>infrasonic</b> microphone was placed near the obstacle to un-derstand the characteristic frequency range in infrasonic waves produced by avalanches. Moreover, the site was implemented in Fall 2012 with a snow/weather station installed on the ridge at 2570 m asl to understand the influence of snowdrift on avalanche release. The data registered by obstacle an...|$|R
40|$|Fiber-based interferometers {{provide the}} means to sense very small {{displacements}} over long baselines, and {{have the advantage of}} being nearly completely passive in their operation, making them particularly well suited for geophysical applications. This work presents the development and results from four new systems: one in atmospheric acoustics and three in Earth strain. Turbulent pressure fluctuations (wind noise) are a significant limiting factor in low-frequency atmospheric acoustic measurements. The Optical Fiber Infrasound Sensor (OFIS) provides an alternative to traditional <b>infrasonic</b> wind <b>noise</b> reduction (WNR) techniques by providing an instantaneous average over a large spatial extent. This study shows that linear OFISs ranging in length from 30 to 270 m provide a WNR of up to 30 dB in winds up to 5 m/s, in good agreement with a new analytical model. Arrays of optical fiber strainmeters were deployed to measure sediment compaction at two sites in Bangladesh. One array at Jamalganj (in the north) consists of 20, 40, 60, and 100 m long strainmeters, while the second near Khulna (in the south) also includes lengths of 80 and 300 m. Two years of weekly measurements show a clear seasonal signal and subsidence at both sites that is in reasonable agreement with collocated GPS receivers. A new 250 -meter, interferometric vertical borehole strainmeter has been developed based completely on passive optical components. Details of the prototyping, design, and deployment at the Piñon Flat Observatory (PFO) are presented. Power spectra show an intertidal noise level of - 130 dB (re. 1 [epslion] /Hz), consistent within 1 - 3 dB between redundant components. Examination of its response to Earth tides and earthquakes relative to the areal strain recorded by an orthogonal pair of collocated, 730 m horizontal laser strainmeters yield a Poisson's ratio of 0. 26. Two prototype horizontal strainmeters were also developed to explore the use of similar interferometric optical fiber technology for near-surface, long baseline strain measurement. Both instruments are shown to faithfully record earthquakes and yield very good estimates of the M 2 tidal constituent, despite unexplained 2 - 8 % amplitude discrepancies between the 90 and 180 m long instruments relative to the collocated laser strainmeter and each othe...|$|R
50|$|In {{experiments}} using heart-rate conditioning, Pigeons {{have been}} found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz. For frequencies below 10 Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55 dB which is at least 50 dB more sensitive than humans. Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1 Hz and 20 Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20 Hz to a 7% shift at 1 Hz. Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate conditioning test. In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird’s heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not. Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon’s sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light. These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient <b>noise.</b> <b>Infrasonic</b> stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the tone burst stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients.|$|R
