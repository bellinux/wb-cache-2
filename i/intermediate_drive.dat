50|$|The {{powered axles}} of the ER2 {{trainset}} are individually driven: each axle {{is powered by}} its own traction motor, which {{is connected to the}} axle by a pair of spur gears with a torque ratio of 3.17 (73:23) in a fully enclosed gearbox. The large gear with a transmission modulus of 10 is mounted directly on the axle, whereas the small gear is on a shaft which is mounted on 2 ball bearings (on early trains) or roller bearings (on later trains). The gearbox casing is mounted on the axle by means of a sealed roller bearing, and is also attached to the truck frame via a special suspension. Initially this suspension comprised a sickle-shaped link with 2 rubber and metal shock absorbers, but beginning in 1969 this was replaced by a vertical rod with 4 such shock absorbers (as on the ER22). During motion of the train, the frame-suspended motors constantly move relative to the axles, which requires some kind of flexible drive to accommodate this motion. On early ER2s this was achieved by means of a jaw coupling between the motor shaft and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, but on later trains, rubber rag joints were used instead. The first such joint was fitted to an ER2 in 1964 as an experiment; in late 1965, five more prototypes with rubber couplings were built, and from 1966 onward these became standard on all new ER2s.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the results of the {{experimental}} study of influence of installation faults on tractive ability of belt conveyor <b>intermediate</b> <b>drive.</b> The alternative of experimental simulation of cyclic displacement relative to cross displacement of belts is suggested. The displacement is created by forced cocking of joint of the upper bench contour. The study procedure and applied equipment are described. The physical ‘observation’ method of relative rest and sliding zones of belts is suggested. This method is based on capturing temperature difference at entry and exit points of the zones which is produced through the implementation of the principle of belt dry friction within the specified zone. Experimental confirmation of the existence of relative rest and sliding zones in the contact area of so called ‘load’ and tractive belts is obtained from the studies. Experimental confirmation of the hypothesis on sequencing of these zones formation in the contact area of belts is obtained as well. The significance of influence of probable installation faults on tractive ability of belt conveyor <b>intermediate</b> <b>drive</b> is shown in practice. There are the findings regarding the need of taking into account the stated phenomenon when designing belt conveyor...|$|E

However, the direct x-ray output form the pinch produces a very sharp and rapidly attenuating pressure pulse in target materials. To obtain high quality measurements with this source, a mechanism for generating non-attenuating waves is needed. One possibility involves using the x-ray source to throw a near-normal density <b>intermediate</b> <b>drive</b> at the target, a situation similar to more conventional configurations. To scope out preliminary design parameters, they used the ALEGRA code to simulate a number of different possibilities involving the driver and the gap between it and the target. They used a somewhat idealized radiation source [...] a main x-ray pulse 30 ns long at its base and peaking at a blackbody temperature of 100 eV.

40|$|SummaryIt {{remains unclear}} whether in a {{bacterial}} fatty acid synthase (FAS) acyl chain transfer is a programmed or diffusion controlled and random action. Acyl carrier protein (ACP), which delivers all intermediates and interacts with all synthase enzymes, {{is the key}} player in this process. High-resolution structures of intermediates covalently bound to an ACP representing each step in fatty acid biosynthesis have been solved by solution NMR. These include hexanoyl-, 3 -oxooctanyl-, 3 R-hydroxyoctanoyl-, 2 -octenoyl-, and octanoyl-ACP from Streptomyces coelicolor FAS. The high-resolution structures reveal that the ACP adopts a unique conformation for each <b>intermediate</b> <b>driven</b> by changes in the internal fatty acid binding pocket.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, laser {{machining}} {{technology has been}} used widely in industrial applications usually {{with the aim of}} increasing the production capability of mass production lines - especially for fast marking, engraving type of applications where speed is an important concern - or manufacturing quality of a certain facility by increasing the level of accuracy in material processing applications such as drilling, cutting; or any scientific research oriented work where high precision machining of parts in sub millimeter scale might be required. A galvanometric scanner is a high precision device that is able to steer a laser beam with a mirror attached to a motor, whose rotor angular range is usually limited with tens of degrees in both directions of rotation; and position is controlled either by voltage or current. Due to their lightness, the rotor and the mirror can move very fast, allowing fast marking (burning out) operation with the laser beam. This can be evaluated as a great advantage compared to slower mechanical appliances used for cutting/machining of different materials. This study concentrates on the analysis of galvanometric scanner system components; and the design and implementation of a hardware and software based control system for a dual-axis galvo setup; and their adaptation for use in laser micromachining applications either as a standalone system or a modular subsystem. Analysis part of the thesis work contains: evaluation of dominant laser micromachining techniques, an overview of the galvanometric scanner system based approach and related components (e. g. electromechanical, electrical, optical), understanding of working principles and related simulation work, compatibility issues with the target micromachining applications.

40|$|T 4 polynucleotide kinase–phosphatase (Pnkp) exemplifies {{a family}} of enzymes with 50 -kinase and 30 -phosphatase {{activities}} that function in nucleic acid repair. The polynucleotide 30 -phosphatase reaction is executed by the Pnkp C-terminal domain, which belongs to the DxDxT acyl-phosphatase superfamily. The 30 -phosphatase reaction entails formation and hydrolysis of a covalent enzyme-(Asp 165) -phosphate <b>intermediate,</b> <b>driven</b> by general acid–base catalyst Asp 167. We report that Pnkp also has RNA 20 -phosphatase activity that requires Asp 165 and Asp 167. The physiological substrate for Pnkp phosphatase is an RNA 20, 30 -cyclic phosphate end (RNA>p), but the pathway of cyclic phosphate removal and its enzymic requirements are undefined. Here we find that Pnkp reactivity with RNA>p requires Asp 165, but not Asp 167. Whereas wild-type Pnkp transforms RNA>p to RNAOH, mutant D 167 N converts RNA>p to RNA 30 -phosphate, which it sequesters in the phosphatase active site. In support of the intermedi-acy of an RNA phosphomonoester, the reaction of mutant S 211 A with RNA>p results in transient ac-cumulation of RNAp en route to RNAOH.
