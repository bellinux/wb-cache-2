25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E

50|$|The {{timing light}} is {{connected}} to the ignition circuit and used to illuminate the timing marks on the engine's crankshaft pulley or flywheel, with the engine running. The apparent position of the marks, frozen by the stroboscopic effect, indicates the current timing of the spark in relation to piston position. A reference pointer is attached to the <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> or other fixed point, and an engraved scale gives the offset between the spark time and the top dead centre position of the piston in the cylinder. The distributor can be rotated slightly until the reference pointer aligns with the specified point on the timing scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{traction}} engine was a four-pole, three-phase, 525-volt AC induction motor, weighing 143 pounds (65 kg), {{with a maximum}} speed of 24,000 rpm; it had an aluminum housing, was lubricated by oil, and had an 8:1 motor to final drive ratio. Electrical power was supplied by a water-cooled, three-phase alternator which was built into a two-stage gas turbine, fueled with liquified natural gas, running at 50,000 rpm at low speed and 100,000 rpm at high speed, weighing 186 pounds. Additional energy for acceleration was provided by a 147-pound SatCon composite <b>flywheel</b> <b>housed</b> in a vacuum chamber running at 58,000 rpm, coupled to the drive train via three-phase permanent magnets in a Halbach array.|$|R

50|$|The EJ20X and EJ20Y {{are open}} deck engines whereby the {{cylinder}} walls were supported {{at the three}} and nine o’clock positions. It came with an aluminium alloy block with 92.0 mm bores - with cast iron cylinder liners - and a 75.0 mm stroke for a capacity of 1994 cc. with thicker cylinder walls than EJ25The crankcase for the EJ20X and EJ20Y engines had five main bearings and the <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> was cast with the crankcase for increased rigidity. The EJ20X engine is understood to have a forged crankshaft and connecting rods, but cast aluminium pistons with forged crowns.The EJ20X and EJ20Y engines had an aluminium alloy cylinder head with cross-flow cooling, double overhead camshafts (DOHC) per cylinder bank and four valves per cylinder that were actuated by roller rocker arms.|$|E
50|$|GM {{launched}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the transmission <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing,</b> serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck {{comes to a stop}} and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.|$|E
50|$|The Coventry Climax {{engines are}} of the IOE configuration, with a bore of 60 mm and a stroke of 90 mm, giving 1018 cc. Generally a Solex side-draught {{carburettor}} was fitted. During 1931 {{the rear of the}} engine was supported on a 3/16-inch steel plate spanning across the chassis, consequently the gearbox bell housing was deep and with the starter alongside. Later cars had a cast-iron <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> and a much shallower bell housing, the starter was then repositioned alongside the engine. This arrangement was used on later Super 9s & 10’s and on Glorias. The cooling waster is circulated by thermal syphon aided by the sloping shape of the aluminium water manifold on the head. The dynamo is driven by a Duplex chain with the distributor mounted at the rear end of the dynamo. A top speed of 60 mph was obtainable with a cruising speed of 45 mph. Petrol consumption in the region of 35 mpg for a car weighing 19 cwt. unladen.|$|E
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E
40|$|Caterpillar's Technology & Solutions Division conceived, designed, {{built and}} tested an {{electric}} turbocompound system for an on-highway heavy-duty truck engine. The {{heart of the}} system is a unique turbochargerr with an electric motor/generator mounted on the shaft between turbine and compressor wheels. When the power produced by the turbocharger turbine exceeds the power of the compressor, the excess power is converted to electrical power by the generator on the turbo shaft; that power is then used to help turn the crankshaft via an electric motor mounted in the engine <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing.</b> The net result is an improvement in engine fuel economy. The electric turbocompound system provides added control flexibility because it is capable of varying the amount of power extracted from the exhaust gases, thus allowing for control of engine boost. The system configuration and design, turbocharger features, control system development, and test results are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores two {{approaches}} for converting rotating mechanical power from diesel engines into electrical power of fixed frequency and voltage. Advances in high energy permanent magnets and power electronics are enabling technologies that {{provide opportunities for}} electrical machines with increased efficiency and compact size. Two approaches are explored, Variable Speed and Fixed Speed power generation. For variable speed, the concept of Variable Speed Integrated Generating Sets (VSIGs) are discussed and suitable electrical machine types reviewed. Axial and Radial permanent magnet machines are compared in detail. An axial flux machine {{often referred to as}} the TORUS is researched, and a 50 kW unit designed to integrate within the <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> of a diesel engine. Manufacturing aspects are considered, and two prototype machines are built and tested, the second machine demonstrates a rating of 60 kW at 3000 rpm. A machine model based upon a combination of Finite Element Analysis and polynomial curve fitting is developed to provide an insight into the design of such machines. During the course of this research a new form of axial electrical machine known as the Haydock Brown Machine was invented. The fundamental problem of regulating the output voltage for permanent machines has been over come by the addition of an excitation coil. Saturation, significant leakage fields and three excitation sources make the electromagnetic design process for the Haydock Brown Machine complex. The intuitive application of an equivalent circuit model provides satisfactory results and a 10 kW prototype machine operating at fixed speed is built and tested. Using the model new observations are made and a new improved version is proposed called the Haydock Brown Hybrid Machine...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{approaches}} for converting rotational mechanical power from diesel engines into electrical power of fixed frequency and voltage. Advances in high energy permanent magnets and power electronics are enabling technologies that {{provide opportunities for}} electrical machines with increased efficiency and compact size for variable speed power generation. The overall objective was to design a permanent magnet machine with concentrated winding {{that could be used}} in variable speed application. Specifically, the aim is to extract the maximum power density and torque by utilizing high pole numbers and minimizing magnetic material content. The concept of variable speed is discussed and suitable electrical machines are reviewed.

40|$|The Advanced Electric Systems and Aerodynamics for Efficiency Improvements in Heavy Duty Trucks program (DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42189), {{commonly}} referred to as the AES program, focused on areas that will primarily benefit fuel economy and improve heat rejection while driving over the road. The AES program objectives were to: (1) Analyze, design, build, and test a cooling system that provided a minimum of 10 percent greater heat rejection in the same frontal area with no increase in parasitic fan load. (2) Realize fuel savings with advanced power management and acceleration assist by utilizing an integrated starter/generator (ISG) and energy storage devices. (3) Quantify the effect of aerodynamic drag due to the frontal shape mandated by the area required for the cooling system. The program effort consisted of modeling and designing components for optimum fuel efficiency, completing fabrication of necessary components, integrating these components into the chassis test bed, completing controls programming, and performance testing the system both on a chassis dynamometer and on the road. Emission control measures for heavy-duty engines have resulted in increased engine heat loads, thus introducing added parasitic engine cooling loads. Truck electrification, in the form of thermal management, offers technological solutions to mitigate or even neutralize the effects of this trend. Thermal control offers opportunities to avoid increases in cooling system frontal area and forestall reduced fuel economy brought about by additional aerodynamic vehicle drag. This project explored such thermal concepts by installing a 2007 engine that is compliant with current regulations and bears additional heat rejection associated with meeting these regulations. This newer engine replaced the 2002 engine from a previous project that generated less heat rejection. Advanced power management, utilizing a continuously optimized and controlled power flow between electric components, can offer additional fuel economy benefits to the heavy-duty trucking industry. Control software for power management brings added value to the power distribution and energy storage architecture on board a truck with electric accessories and an ISG. The research team has built upon a previous truck electrification project, formally, 'Parasitic Energy Loss Reduction and Enabling Technologies for Class 7 / 8 Trucks', DE-FC 04 - 2000 AL 6701, where the fundamental concept of electrically-driven accessories replacing belt/gear-driven accessories was demonstrated on a Kenworth T 2000 truck chassis. The electrical accessories, shown in Figure 1, were controlled to provide 'flow on demand' variable-speed operation and reduced parasitic engine loads for increased fuel economy. These accessories also provided solutions for main engine idle reduction in long haul trucks. The components and systems of the current project have been integrated into the same Kenworth T 2000 truck platform. Reducing parasitic engine loading by decoupling accessory loads from the engine and driving them electrically has been a central concept of this project. Belt or gear-driven engine accessories, such as water pump, air conditioning compressor, or air compressor, are necessarily tied to the engine speed dictated by the current vehicle operating conditions. These conventional accessory pumps are sized to provide adequate flow or pressure at low idle or peak torque speeds, resulting in excess flow or pressure at cruising or rated speeds. The excess flow is diverted through a pressure-minimizing device such as a relief valve thereby expending energy to drive unnecessary and inefficient pump operation. This inefficiency causes an increased parasitic load to the engine, which leads to a loss of usable output power and decreased fuel economy. Controlling variable-speed electric motors to provide only the required flow or pressure of a particular accessory system can yield significant increases in fuel economy for a commercial vehicle. Motor loads at relatively high power levels (1 - 5 kW, or higher) can be efficiently provided current from high-efficiency generators or batteries with system voltages in the range of 250 to 360 volts DC (VDC). In the previous project, the electric accessories could be powered from one of three sources: an AC voltage source ('shore power'), an on-board diesel generator (auxiliary power unit), or an ISG located in the <b>flywheel</b> <b>housing</b> and driven by the main engine. The electric accessories and power sources, including the ISG, have remained in place for the current upgrade of the research platform vehicle. In this project, more emphasis has been placed on determining the best way to use the ISG to power the vehicle and accessories, thereby yielding additional value from existing hardware...|$|E
