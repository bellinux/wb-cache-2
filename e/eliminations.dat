5|$|Thirteen men's {{and fifteen}} women's teams {{competed in the}} team competitions. The teams {{consisted}} of the country's three archers from the individual round, and the team's initial ranking was determined by summing the three members' scores in the individual ranking round. Each round of <b>eliminations</b> consisted of each team firing 27 arrows (9 by each archer).|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Edge and Mysterio went their {{separate}} ways to focus on their singles careers. Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match on January 19, 2003, where he had three <b>eliminations</b> before getting eliminated by Chris Jericho. Edge then teamed up with Chris Benoit, facing Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Charlie Haas, and Shelton Benjamin) {{in a series of}} singles and tag team matches. Prior to No Way Out, Edge suffered a legitimate neck injury, rendering him unable to compete in his scheduled match. At the event on February 23, Edge was written off television through a backstage attack. He then underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood and was sidelined for over a year.|$|E

Ziggler returned to television {{on the next}} SmackDown and qualified for the Royal Rumble match by beating Barrett in a non-title match. In the 2015 Royal Rumble match, Ziggler entered as the last entrant, scored two <b>eliminations</b> but was quickly eliminated by Big Show and Kane. At Fastlane, Ziggler competed together with Rowan and Ryback in a six-man tag team match against Rollins, Big Show and Kane, which they lost. On the March 5 episode of SmackDown, Ziggler was announced as {{a participant in the}} 7-man ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 31, which was won by Daniel Bryan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{simplify the}} task of proving {{termination}} and AC-termination of term rewriting systems, <b>elimination</b> transformations have been vigorously stud-ied since the 1990 's. Dummy <b>elimination,</b> distribution <b>elimination,</b> general dummy <b>elimination</b> and improved general dummy <b>elimination</b> are examples of <b>elimination</b> transformations. In this paper we clarify the essence of <b>elimination</b> transformations based {{on the notion of}} dependency pairs. We rst present a theorem that gives a gen-eral and essential property for <b>elimination</b> transformations, making them sound with AC-termination. Based on the theorem, we design an <b>elimination</b> transformation called the argument ltering transformation. Next, we clarify the relation among various <b>elimination</b> transformations by comparing them with a corresponding re-stricted argument ltering transformation. Finally, we compare the AC-dependency pair method with the argument ltering transformation...|$|R

5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in <b>eliminations</b> of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|Former WWF Champion Randy Savage was {{the last}} wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were {{eliminated}} in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal Rumble match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow drop from the top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named {{the winner of the}} 1993 Royal Rumble match. During the match, he eliminated seven wrestlers, which broke the previous record for most <b>eliminations</b> in a Royal Rumble match.|$|E
5|$|The pre-show {{featured}} one match, the New Japan Rumble. Tiger Mask and Yuji Nagata {{began the}} match, with new wrestlers entering each minute. Wrestlers worked to eliminate each other, {{and the last}} remaining wrestler won. In this match, <b>eliminations</b> could occur via pinfall, submission, disqualification, or being {{thrown out of the}} ring over the top rope. The Great Kabuki, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Hiro Saito were surprise entrants. Captain New Japan was the first eliminated when Tama Tonga threw him over the top rope. Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu worked together to eliminate Taichi and Tiger Mask. After Tanaka was eliminated by submitting to Manabu Nakanishi's torture rack, Tonga eliminated Nakanishi and Komatsu via pinfall, the latter after a jumping DDT. Yoshi-Hashi threw Tonga over the top rope for the elimination, leaving himself and Nagata in the match. Nagata won the match by slamming Hashi against the mat with a belly-to-back suplex, bridging into a pinfall elimination at 26 minutes and 9 seconds.|$|E
40|$|To {{simplify the}} task of proving {{termination}} of term rewriting systems, several <b>elimination</b> methods, such as the dummy <b>elimination,</b> the distribution <b>elimination,</b> the general dummy <b>elimination</b> and the improved general dummy <b>elimination,</b> have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the argument ltering method combining with the dependency pair technique is essential in all the above <b>elimination</b> methods. We present remarkable simple proofs for the soundness of these <b>elimination</b> methods based on this observation. Moreover, we propose a new <b>elimination</b> method, called the argument ltering transformation, which is not only more powerful {{than all the other}} <b>elimination</b> methods but also especially useful to make clear the essential relation hidden behind these methods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn <b>elimination</b> tree {{is a form}} of {{recursive}} factorization for Bayesian networks. <b>Elimination</b> trees can be used as {{the basis}} for a practical implementation of Bayesian network inference via conditioning graphs. The time complexity for inference in <b>elimination</b> trees {{has been shown to be}} O(nexp(d)), where d is the height of the <b>elimination</b> tree. In this paper, we demonstrate two new heuristics for building small <b>elimination</b> trees. We also demonstrate a simple technique for deriving <b>elimination</b> trees from Darwiche et al. ’s dtrees, and vice versa. We show empirically that our heuristics, combined with a constructive process for building <b>elimination</b> trees, produces the smaller <b>elimination</b> trees than previous methods...|$|R

In the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final against Manchester United, Pirlo set up Seedorf's goal, as Milan progressed on to the final. In the 2007 Champions League Final in Athens, Pirlo {{assisted}} Inzaghi's first goal, helping Milan to defeat Liverpool 2–1, avenging their 2005 final defeat in Istanbul. During the 2007–08 season, Pirlo won his second UEFA Super Cup with Milan, assisting Milan's second goal in the final, and winning the Man of the Match award; he also contributed to the club's first ever FIFA World Club Cup title in 2007, once again setting-up Milan's second goal in the final. In October 2007, he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year, and the 2007 IFFHS World's Best Playmaker Awards, but they were all won by Milan teammate Kaká, as Pirlo placed 5th in the Ballon d'or, 7th in the FIFA World Player of the Year, and 2nd in the World's Best Playmaker Awards. Despite a strong start, Milan suffered a dip in form {{during the second half of}} the season, finishing the league in fifth place, failing to qualify for the UEFA Champions' League; Milan also suffered <b>eliminations</b> in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League and the Coppa Italia that season. The following season, Milan managed a second-place finish in Serie A, alongside Juventus, and behind local rivals Inter, whilst they were eliminated in the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup, and the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a review of {{structural}} decomposition methods in discrete optimization and to give a unified framework in the form of local <b>elimination</b> algorithms (LEA). This paper is organized as follows. Local <b>elimination</b> algorithms for discrete optimization (DO) problems (DOPs) with constraints are considered; a classification of dynamic programming computational procedures is given. We introduce <b>Elimination</b> Game and <b>Elimination</b> tree. Application of bucket <b>elimination</b> algorithm from constraint satisfaction (CS) to solving DOPs is done. We consider different local <b>elimination</b> schemes and related notions. Clustering that merges several variables into single meta-variable defines a promising approach to solve DOPs. This allows to create a quotient (condensed) graph and apply a local block <b>elimination</b> algorithm. In order to describe a block <b>elimination</b> process, we introduce Block <b>Elimination</b> Game. We discuss the connection of aforementioned local <b>elimination</b> algorithmic schemes and a way of transforming the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of computational LEA procedure to the tree decomposition.

25|$|The small local cost {{provided}} towns {{incentive to}} petition for crossing <b>eliminations</b> to prevent public thoroughfares from being blocked by trains. Numerous municipalities soon agitated for crossing <b>eliminations,</b> with Brockton's April 1891 petition {{the first of}} the lot. Shortly before then, the Old Colony Railroad announced plans to replace the aging and undersized Brockton station with a more appropriate structure. The station design was well-received, but its at-grade design - which would have precluded crossing <b>eliminations</b> - was seen {{as a threat to the}} economic future of the city. Brockton then had no fire station east of the railroad, adding fire safety concerns to the more widespread issue of pedestrian safety. Frequent delays for fire engines responding to calls caused higher insurance rates and lower land values in the eastern part of the city.|$|E
