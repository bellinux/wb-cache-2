5000|$|The {{business}} model of fast fashion {{is based on}} consumers’ desire for new clothing to wear. In order to fulfill consumer’s demand, fast fashion brands provide affordable prices and {{a wide range of}} clothing that reflects the latest trends. This ends up persuading consumers to buy more items which leads to the issue of overconsumption.Planned Obsolescence {{plays a key role in}} overconsumption. Based on the study of planned obsolescence in the Economist, Fashion is deeply committed to built-in obsolescence. Last year's skirts; for example, are designed to be replaced by this year's new models. In this case, <b>fashion</b> <b>goods</b> are purchased even when the old ones are still wearable. The quick response model and new supply chain practices of fast fashion even accelerate the speed of it. In recent years, the fashion cycle has steadily decreased as fast fashion retailers sell clothing that is expected to be disposed of after being worn only a few times. [...] This dramatically shortens the consumers’ buying cycle. The quick changing stocks and low price of <b>fashion</b> <b>goods</b> encourage consumers to visit the store and make purchases more frequently. As a result, excessive stock and untrendy clothes tends to end up in landfills.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignJoy M. KozarWithin {{the global}} marketplace, the {{production}} and consumption of counterfeit goods represents a serious social problem. Scholars continue to suggest anti-counterfeit education {{as a means to}} resolve this global problem and curb the demand for counterfeit goods, but no scholarly research has empirically evaluated the effectiveness of anti-counterfeit education. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to draw upon such suggestions within the literature, and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of anti-counterfeit education on consumers' perceived knowledge, attitudes, and purchase intentions of <b>fashion</b> counterfeit <b>goods.</b> 	 Convenience samples of male and female college students participated in this study. Utilizing a one-group pretest posttest, quasi-experimental design, the findings from a series of paired samples t-tests revealed a positive, significant change in consumers’ perceived knowledge of <b>fashion</b> counterfeit <b>goods</b> after viewing the anti-counterfeit educational unit. Negative, significant changes in consumers’ favorable attitudes and purchase intentions of <b>fashion</b> counterfeit <b>goods</b> were also revealed after the anti-counterfeit educational unit had been administered. Findings from this study provide relevant implications toward academicians, government officials, fashion retailers, and anti-counterfeiting organizations, such as how to develop effective anti-counterfeit educational content. Such parties with a vested interest in deterring the demand of <b>fashion</b> counterfeit <b>goods</b> should focus on formulating and implementing anti-counterfeit educational tools, such as campaigns and advertisements, which focus on the negative factors and consequences associated with the fashion counterfeit industry...|$|R

50|$|Part of the Arts and Crafts {{movement}} of the 1930s the business was designed to showcase the value of handcrafts and their authenticity.

Results and findings from the analysis {{can be used to}} develop effective interventions for eliciting behavioral change, especially within nutrition and health but not for luxury or <b>fashion</b> <b>goods</b> where one's need behind his purchase intentions (behavior) are in most social context cases to associate, dissociate or show status.|$|E

The property of being demand-driven is one of degree: Being [...] "0 percent" [...] demand-driven means all production/inventory decisions are based on forecasts, and so, all products available for sale to the end user is there by virtue of a forecast. This could be the case of <b>fashion</b> <b>goods,</b> where the designer may not know how buyers will react to a new design, or the beverage industry, where products are produced based on a given forecast.

It {{was built by}} the Swedish construction company SIAB, which {{was at that time}} very unusual. The floor plan consists of multiple intertwined hexagons. Kotva has five stories above ground, a total of ten interconnected escalators (two shafts of five escalators) and about the same number underground, serving as a garage and supermarket. It was intended to become a symbol of abundance and wealth in socialism. At the time of construction it was the largest {{department store}} in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Kotva did not avoid supply problems, which showed the weakness of the country's economy.

40|$|Many {{organizations}} need {{to forecast}} {{large numbers of}} time series that are organized in a hierarchical <b>fashion.</b> <b>Good</b> forecasting practices recommend that several hierarchies be used and that each hierarchy contain a homogeneous set of time series with similar statistical properties. Modeling and forecasting homogeneous time series hierarchies provide better out-of-sample forecast performance. Because an organization might have many time series hierarchies, it is often desirable to model and forecast these hierarchical time series in parallel for computational efficiency. Also, it is often desirable to aggregate forecasts from several nonhomogeneous time series hierarchies for report generation. This paper demonstrates these techniques for forecasting time series hierarchies in parallel and aggregating the forecasts by using SAS ® Forecast Server and SAS ® Grid Manager...|$|R
