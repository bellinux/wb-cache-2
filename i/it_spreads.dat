5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that <b>it</b> <b>spreads</b> across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where <b>it</b> <b>spreads</b> to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E

Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. <b>It</b> <b>spreads</b> quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E

However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as <b>it</b> <b>spreads</b> to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E

Six motorcyclists from the Garde Républicaine, the élite of the gendarmerie, ride with them.|$|E

Additionally, symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome. In patients in whom pregnancy is a possibility, BHCG level should be measured during the diagnosis process. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase should be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger patients {{are more likely to}} have malignant germ cell tumors.|$|E

25|$|A {{squall line}} is an {{organized}} line of thunderstorms. It {{is classified as}} a multi-cell cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called multi-cell lines. Squalls are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, {{but they can also}} occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel clouds, tornadoes and waterspouts. Squall lines require significant low-level warmth and humidity, a nearby frontal zone, and vertical wind shear from an angle behind the frontal boundary. The strong winds at the surface are usually a reflection of dry air intruding into the line of storms, which when saturated, falls quickly to ground level due to its much higher density before <b>it</b> <b>spreads</b> out downwind. Significant squall lines with multiple bow echoes are known as derechos.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, <b>it</b> <b>spreads</b> through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E
25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. <b>It</b> <b>spreads</b> out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E
