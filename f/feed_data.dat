25|$|Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW : Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The {{original}} {{concept of}} the LHX program was to produce a one-man helicopter that could do more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single-pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The cockpit was designed so sensors would <b>feed</b> <b>data</b> to the pilot through helmet mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single-pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche {{was designed to be}} operated by a crew of two.|$|E
500|$|When Zeus {{was still}} {{in the early stages of}} design, Bell Labs {{suggested}} using two similar radars to provide extended range tracking and improve reaction times. Located at the Zeus bases would be the Local Acquisition Radar (LAR), a UHF monopulse radar able to track between 50 and 100 targets. The Forward Acquisition Radar (FAR) would be positioned [...] ahead of the Zeus bases to provide early warning of up to 200 to 300seconds of tracking data on up to 200 targets. The FAR would broadcast 10MW pulses at UHF between 405–495MHz, allowing it to detect a 1square metre radar reflection at [...] or a more typical 0.1m2 target at [...] Each track would be stored as a 200 bit file including location, velocity, time of measure and a measure of the quality of the data. Clouds of objects would be tracked as a single object with additional data indicating the width and length of the cloud. Tracks could be updated every five seconds while the target was in view, but the antenna rotated at a relatively slow 4RPM so targets moved significantly between rotations. Each FAR could <b>feed</b> <b>data</b> to up to three Zeus sites.|$|E

50|$|Fundamental {{analysis}} {{software is}} typically used with {{end of day}} (EOD), delayed or real time <b>data</b> <b>feeds.</b> EOD <b>data</b> <b>feeds</b> provide the end of day close, open, high, and low price for the given equity and is typically updated once a day at market close.

5000|$|In {{the thrust}} mode {{the engine is}} {{maintained}} at a fixed power setting according to the different flight phases. For example, during takeoff, A/T maintains constant takeoff power until takeoff mode is finished. During climb, A/T maintains constant climb power; in descent, A/T retards the throttle to IDLE position, and so on. When A/T is working in thrust mode, speed is controlled by pitch (or the control column), and NOT protected by A/T. A radar altimeter <b>feeds</b> <b>data</b> to the autothrottle mostly in this mode. (In Boeing it <b>feeds</b> <b>data</b> to the autothrottle every time. See below.) ...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{software}} systems we use for everyday purposes incorporate elements developed and maintained by third parties. These elements include not only code components and data bases but also dynamic <b>data</b> <b>feeds</b> from online <b>data</b> sources. Even though everyday software is not mission critical it must be dependable enough for its intended use. This {{is limited by the}} dependability of its constituting elements. It is especially difficult to assess the dependability of dynamic <b>data</b> <b>feeds</b> because they exhibit not only “fail-silent” behavior but also semantic failures—delivery of unreasonable yet well structured results by a responsive <b>data</b> <b>feed.</b> Further, it is normal for the behavior of such <b>data</b> <b>feeds</b> to change. Unfortunately, the specifications of these <b>data</b> <b>feeds</b> are often too incomplete and sketchy to support failure detection. We propose an approach for benchmarking the semantic availability of redundant <b>data</b> <b>feeds.</b> The fault model is defined as violations of inferred invariants about the usual behavior of a <b>data</b> <b>feed.</b> 1...|$|R
