This single VLSI device, known as the Parallel Integrated Frame Synchronizer (PIFS) chip, integrates most of the functionality contained in high density 9 U VME card frame synchronizer subsystems currently in use. In 1987, a first generation 20 Mbps VMEBus frame synchronizer based on 2. 0 micron CMOS VLSI technology was developed by <b>Data</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Technology</b> Division. In 1990, this subsystem architecture was recast using 0. 8 micron ECL & GaAs VLSI to achieve 300 Mbps performance. The PIFS chip, based on 0. 7 micron CMOS technology, will provide a superset of the current VMEBus subsystem functions at rates up to 500 Mbps at approximately one-tenth current replication costs. Functions performed by this third generation device include true and inverted 64 bit marker correlation with programmable error tolerances, programmable frame length and marker patterns, programmable search-check-lock-flywheel acquisition strategy, slip detection, and CRC error detection. Acquired frames can optionally be annotated with quality trailer and time stamp. A comprehensive set of cumulative accounting registers are provided on-chip for data quality monitoring. Prototypes of the PIFS chip are expected in October 1995. This paper will describe the architecture and implementation of this new low-cost high functionality device...|$|E

40|$|With {{the market}} {{conditions}} becoming tougher and tougher, due to more competition through {{the implementation of}} the European market, a greater sensitivity for environmental protection with its ensuing impact on planning conditions, project controlling has become more important than ever. One aim of this paper is developing an integrated system of project controlling, i. e. the integration of time planning, cost planning and capacity planning in one single system. It is based on the algorithms of critical path analysis, providing the basic components for time planning. However, to make such a system practical graphic presentations and control mechanisms are required above all. Besides, additional components for deadline and cost checks at any given time plus actual and target comparisons for the past or planning variants are needed. This paper focuses on optimising the use of production facilities. This very field is the least developed in intermediate <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> <b>technology.</b> One essential {{reason for this is that}} the computing procedures used so far take so much time even on large computers that they are hardly used in practice. M. Bartusch's thesis and T. Falck's paper outline a method that finds the shortest project duration/span by variations of scheduling with the number of production facilities given. This method has been adapted to computers of intermediate <b>data</b> <b>systems</b> <b>technology.</b> It is supplemented by an exact method providing the lowest number of production facilities by leveling with the project duration given. In addition a target function has been derived additionally smoothing the operation curve of production facilities by applying special heuristics. Wile dealing with these curves it became manifest that a certain flexibility in determining the curve is more often required rather than a minimum number of production facilities. Heuristics in connection with the assessed target function is able to cope with this demand. Maximum use of production facilities as defined by the users can be traced. Tests have demostrated the high quality of heuristic planning results, often identical with the optimum solution. This paper makes available to modern management a system which now in addition to time scheduling and cost budgeting also deals with capacity planning and optimizing in one integrated system...|$|E

The Earth Observing System (EOS) AM- 1 spacecraft, the first satellite of this new era, will produce in only six months as much data as NASA has collected to this date. As a consequence, the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) project is building high performance and highly costly parallel processing systems to address the real-time data production requirements. Together with the high performance front-end ingest and level 0 processing microcircuits developed in-house at the Goddard Space Flight Center’s (GSFC) <b>Data</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Technology</b> Division (DSTD), adaptive computers present a possible alternative to traditional CPU-based systems to increase the performance while reducing the cost of satellite telemetry processing systems.

Recently, these data simulation tools have demonstrated their versatility and flexibility in the testing and deployment of several very high performance Level Zero Processing (LZP) systems. Because LZP involves the wide scale reordering of transmitted telemetry data, the data simulation tools were required to create {{a number of very}} large and complex simulated data sets to effectively test these high rate systems. These data sets simulated spacecraft with numerous instrument data sources downlinking out-of-sequence and errored data streams. Simulated data streams were encapsulated in Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet and NASCOM data formats. The knowledge and expertise gained {{in the development of the}} current simulation tools has been used to develop a new generation data simulation tool, known as the Simulated Telemetry Generation (STGEN) package. STGEN is a menu driven software package running on UNIX platforms that can implement dynamic test scenarios with very fast turn around times from the data set design to the data set generation. The error options and locations in the telemetry data stream are fed via simple programs which are in turn script-driven. Scripts are used to manipulate packets, frames, and permit error insertion more easily and quickly. This paper first describes the STGEN software package and its test data design strategies.

The <b>Data</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Technology</b> Division at GSFC is developing prototypes of user interfaces for different functions involved in the operation, analysis and data communication of space station payloads. TAE is a valuable prototyping tool because it enables a developer to build an entire application user interface model and run it without writing a single line of application code. One force driving new development {{is the need to}} update TAE's user interface to support the latest interactive graphic device technology. The current TAE, TAE Classic, uses interface techniques designed for an 80 x 24 character monochrome alphanumeric terminal, but does not effectively utilize features such as windowing, graphics, color, and selection devices available on newer workstations. To meet our needs, development of a TAE Plus began in FY- 86 and involves augmenting TAE with three different sets of tools: a user interface toolkit; an application toolkit; and run-time service subroutines. A phased approach is being used to develop TAE Plus. In the first phase, we have met the needs of the user community and provided some support for rapid prototyping by developing a TAE Facelift, which adds an enhanced TAE interface (with windowing, mouse interaction, pull-down menus, etc.) to a select set of graphic workstations. The TAE Facelift allows many new concepts to be tested quickly for feedback and performance. In the second phase, a fully-integrated user interface management system, TAE Plus, will be built that supports the separation of interface from application, with the concomitant ability to prototype and rapidly change interfaces.

As part of this effort, NASA’s <b>Data</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Technology</b> Division, in cooperation with Clemson University, is developing a Macintosh II based Telemetry and Command (MacTAC) system. This system performs telemetry data processing functions including frame synchronization, Reed-Solomon decoding, and packet reassembly at moderate data rates of 5 Mbps (20 Mbps burst). The MacTAC is a low-cost, transportable, easy to use, compact system designed to meet requirements specified by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) while remaining flexible enough to support {{a wide variety of}} other user specific telemetry processing requirements (e. g., TDM data). In addition, the MacTAC can accept or generate forward data (such as spacecraft commands), calculate and append a Polynomial Check Code (PCC), and output this data to NASCOM to provide full Telemetry and Command (TAC) capability. Semi-custom VLSI gate arrays perform the return link functions of NASCOM deblocking, correlation, and frame synchronization. Reed-Solomon decoding (for error detection) and packet reassembly are also performed by modern microprocessor and semi-custom VLSI components. The local user interface is a standard Macintosh application with the wellknown look and feel of the Macintosh environment. A remote interface is possible via Ethernet which allows the system to be completely controlled from any location capable of generating the required remote operating commands.
