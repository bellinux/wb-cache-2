25|$|Two basic {{performance}} variants of the Type 100 were produced {{during the course}} of the war: the Type 100/40 was an early version with bipod and heavy bayonet lug, judged unsatisfactory because of frequent jamming of the <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the Type 100/44 was a simplified 1944 version that had a higher rate of fire and much greater reliability. A third variant was a lightened version of the early Type 100/40 design which was delivered with a folding stock for navy paratroopers.|$|E
500|$|In June 1939, a Spitfire {{was fitted}} with a drum-fed Hispano in each wing, an {{installation}} that required large blisters on the wing to cover the 60-round drum. The cannon suffered frequent stoppages, mostly because the guns were mounted on their sides to fit {{as much of the}} magazine as possible within the wing. In January 1940, P/O George Proudman flew this prototype in combat, but the starboard gun stopped after firing a single round, while the port gun fired 30 rounds before seizing. If one cannon seized, the recoil of the other threw the aircraft off aim. Nevertheless, 30 more cannon-armed Spitfires were ordered for operational trials, and they were soon known as the Mk IB, to distinguish them from the Browning-armed Mk IA, and were delivered to No. 19 Squadron beginning in June 1940. The Hispanos were found to be so unreliable that the squadron requested an exchange of its aircraft with the older Browning-armed aircraft of an operational training unit. By August, Supermarine had perfected a more reliable installation with an improved <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism</b> and four [...]303s in the outer wing panels. The modified fighters were then delivered to 19 Squadron.|$|E
2500|$|The Type 100/40 was complex, {{designed}} with little consideration for mass production. Its sights and <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism</b> were overly complicated. Its {{rate of fire}} was some 350 to 450 rounds per minute, and it jammed frequently. The 8×22mm Nambu pistol cartridge it fired was rather underpowered, compared to contemporary military pistol cartridges such as 9mm parabellum and [...]45 ACP. In practice, the bayonet was not widely used. Some 10,000 were produced by the Kokura Arsenal for the Imperial Japanese Army.|$|E

2500|$|The Universal wing {{also took}} into account {{the fact that the}} Hispano cannon had been {{converted}} to belt-feed, a move which allowed each cannon to carry double the ammunition load, or 120 rpg in ammunition trays instead of 60 rpg as in the original drum-fed cannon of the F.Mk Vb.

2500|$|The major {{difference}} between the two designs was that the BSA weapons were chambered for [...]303 British ammunition, but the Savage guns were chambered for [...]30-06 cartridges, which necessitated some difference in the magazine, <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism,</b> bolt, barrel, extractors, and gas operation system. Savage did make Lewis guns in [...]303 British calibre, though. The Model 1916 and Model 1917 were exported to Canada and the United Kingdom, and a few were supplied to the US military, particularly the Navy. The Savage Model 1917 was generally produced in [...]30-06 caliber. A number of these guns were supplied to the UK under lend-lease during the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|A {{vertical}} bandsaw, {{also called}} a contour saw, keeps the blade's path stationary while the workpiece is moved across it. [...] This type of saw {{can be used}} to cut out complex shapes and angles. [...] The part may be fed into the blade manually or with a power assist mechanism. [...] This type of metal-cutting bandsaw is often equipped with a built-in blade welder. [...] This not only allows the operator to repair broken blades or fabricate new blades quickly, but also allows for the blade to be purposely cut, routed through the center of a part, and re-welded in order to make interior cuts. [...] These saws are often fitted with a built-in air blower to cool the blade and to blow chips away from the cut area giving the operator {{a clear view of the}} work. [...] This type of saw is also built in a woodworking version. [...] The woodworking type is generally of much lighter construction and does not incorporate a power <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism,</b> coolant, or welder.|$|E

40|$|Three {{types of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are known in dinoflagellates: pallium feeding, tube feeding, and direct engulfment. Pallium feeding {{has only been}} {{described}} for heterotrophic thecate species (Protoperidinium, Diplopsalis group). Tube feeding is commonly found among both naked and thecate species of mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (e. g. Amphidinium, Dinophysis, Gyrodinium, Peridiniopsis). Direct engulfment is mainly found among naked species(e. g. Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium, Noctiluca); recently, however, some thecate species {{have been shown to}} use this <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> as well. <b>Feeding</b> behavior in dinoflagellates involves several steps prior to actual ingestion, including precapture, capture, and prey manipulation. As <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> allow the ingestion of relatively large prey or parts thereof, dinoflagellates are regarded as raptorial feeders. While prey size {{plays an important role in}} the ability of dinoflagellates to ingest food, this alone cannot explain observed prey preferences.

40|$|The elasmobranch fishes {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} diversity of <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{for a group}} containing relatively few species (~ 1200). The three most prevalent of these mechanisms involve prey capture during which the predator overtakes its prey (ram), prey is drawn {{into the mouth of}} the predator (suction), and relatively stationary consumption of sessile or substrate affixed prey (biting). Biomechanical modeling of cranial force distributions, in situ bite performance trials, and kinematic analysis of prey capture behaviors were employed to identify morphological and behavioral specializations and constraints associated with these <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in lemon Negaprion brevirostris (ram), whitespotted bamboo Chiloscyllium plagiosum (suction), and horn Heterodontus francisci (biting) sharks. Biomechanical modeling of the forces generated by the cranial musculature was used to theoretically estimate the maximum bite force and mechanical loadings occurring throughout the hyostyl ic jaw suspension mechanisms of each species, characterized by suspensory hyomandibular cartilages between the back of the jaws and cranium and anterior ligamentous attachments. To assess the mechanical factors involved in the evolution of elasmobranch jaw suspension <b>mechanisms,</b> the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the sharpnose sevengill shark Heptranchias perlo was modeled as well. Heptranchias perlo possesses an ancestral amphistylic jaw suspension mechanism including non-suspensory hyomandibular cartilages, a large post-orbital articulation between the jaws and cranium, and anterior ligamentous attachments. Theoretical estimates of maximum bite force were compared to voluntary bite forces measured during in situ bite performance trials. Voluntary bite force measurements allowed the quantification of discrete behavioral attributes of bite force application in each species. To further assess the behavioral specializations associated with these <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> high-speed digital videography w as used to analyze the prey capture cranial kinematics of species.

50|$|The rimmed 7.62×54mmR {{cartridges}} {{are set in}} a metal ammunition belt, and {{are held}} against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feedway of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle {{on the right side}} of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a belt link was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimmed cartridges.

40|$|Flexible Multibody System Dynamics (FMSD) is a {{simulation}} technique {{that can be}} used to study the behavior of the mechanical systems that consists of one or more deformable bodies. A deformable body can be modeled using a number of approaches while the floating frame of reference formulation is a widely used approach. In that approach, flexibility within Multibody System Dynamics (MSD) is described by employing the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with a modal reduction approach. The applicability of an FMSD in the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of vertebrate structures is tested in order to utilize the potential of the method in biological research. Flexible Multibody System Dynamics is explored studying the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> in a skull of Edingerella madagascariensis.
