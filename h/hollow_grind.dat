40|$|The {{significance}} of ochre in Indigenous Australia is well documented. Several large, well-known quarries containing ochre {{that is highly}} sought after have been described in the archaeological literature, however less {{attention has been paid}} to smaller, regionally and locally significant quarries. In this paper a small yellow ochre quarry (VSTA_ 20140611 _ 1) from the Central Pilbara, where evidence of paint preparation is preserved in the form of residues in two in situ <b>grinding</b> <b>hollows,</b> is described in order to address this oversight. Portable XRF (pXRF) analysis of the pigment in the quarry itself and the paint in the hollows was undertaken to understand the chemistry of the pigmentaceous minerals, to explore the taphonomy of the ochre seam, and to gauge variation within the source. Chemistry indicates that the VSTA_ 20140611 _ 1 quarry is composed of an iron mineral (likely a hydroxide such as goethite), with Fe abundances consistently between 10. 7 and 30 %. Typical of the regional geology, the yellow pigment is consistently siliceous, with an Si abundance of between 5. 8 and 20. 4 %. As there are no painted motifs in the rockshelter containing the VSTA_ 20140611 _ 1 quarry, nor on the suitable BIF surfaces nearby, it is considered highly likely that the surviving paint produced on-site was used for either body decoration or the adornment of artefacts, rather than for rock art production. Nevertheless, the similarity in chemical composition between the VSTA_ 20140611 _ 1 pigments and that of motifs painted in sites a few kilometres away suggests that, in addition to immediate processing and use at the site, ochre from this quarry may have been transported to rockshelters in the vicinity and used for rock art production.

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PM). Double bundle reconstructions appear to give better rotational stability. The usual technique is to make two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia. This is difficult and in small knees {{may not even be}} possible. We have developed a foreign material free press fit fixation for double bundle ACL reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel (R). This is based on the ALL PRESS FIT ACL reconstruction. It is suitable for the most common medium and, otherwise difficult, small sizes of knees. Method: Using diamond edged wet <b>grinding</b> <b>hollow</b> reamers, bone cylinders in different diameters are harvested from the implantation tunnels of the tibia and femur and used for the press fit fixation. Using the press fit technique the graft is first fixed in tibia. It is then similarly fixed under tension in the femoral side with the knee in 120 degree flexion. This is called Bottom To Top Fixation (BTT). On extending the knee the graft tension is self adapting. Depending {{on the size of the}} individual knee, the diameter of the femoral bone plug is varied from 8 to 13 mm to achieve an anatomic spread with a double bundle-like insertion. The tibia tunnel can be applied with two 7 or 8 mm diameter tunnels overlapping to a semi oval tunnel between 10 to 13 mm. Results: Since May 2003 we have carried out ACL-reconstructions with Hamstring grafts without foreign material using the ALL PRESS FIT technique. Initially, an 8 mm press fit fixation was used proximally with good results. Since April 2008, the range of diameters was increased up to 13 mm. The results of the Lachman tests have been good to excellent. Results of the Pivot shift test suggested more stability with femoral broader diameters of 9, 5 to 13 mm. Conclusions: The foreign material free fixation of hamstring in the ALL PRESS FIT Bottom To Top Fixation is a successful method for ACL Reconstruction. The Diamond Instruments and tubed guiding devices are precise, reliable and easy to manage. On this basis a double bundle reconstruction is achieved using a single tunnel. A broad anatomic femoral insertion with autogenous bone plugs inserted near the cortex seems to improve rotational stabilit...|$|R

5000|$|The Nepali kukri has a {{terminology}} of its own, {{including the}} [...] "aunlo bal" [...] (finger of strength/force/energy), a relatively deep and narrow fuller near {{the spine of}} the blade, which runs (at most) between the handle and the corner of the blade, and the [...] "chirra", which may refer either to shallow fullers in the belly of the blade or a <b>hollow</b> <b>grind</b> of the edge, and of which two or three may be used {{on each side of the}} blade.|$|E
50|$|A Sewar is a short-bladed dagger used in {{traditional}} Indonesian close-quarter fighting styles. The weapon {{has a slightly}} curved single or double-edged blade. From the handle's base, the blade either narrows or widens at the tip, depending on the style. The double-edged Sewar has a back edge that runs {{from the tip of}} the blade {{to the base of the}} hilt. Typically, the blade is either flat ground, without a mid-line ridge, or hollow ground. Sometimes it has a slightly <b>hollow</b> <b>grind</b> and a reinforced (integral) back, or comes with several slightly hollow sections.|$|E
50|$|Officers {{carried the}} {{infantry}} officer's sabre, which was 82 cm long {{and had a}} <b>hollow</b> <b>grind</b> on both sides. At the tip the blade was double-edged. The scabbard was made of brass and fitted with a sharpening iron (Schleifeisen). Two iron suspension rings were fastened to the scabbard in order to hang it from the sword belt. The sabre was always carried buckled underneath. The sword knot of the sabre was made of gold thread and consisted of a tassel and strap. The tassel was made of dangling knots (Bouillons) that were gold {{on the outside and}} black inside. This sabre was carried by ensigns and orderly sergeants (dienstführenden Feldwebeln).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of the types found in these two classification categories can, in theory, lead {{to a wide variety}} of blade types such as round point hollow ground, square point flat ground etc., but in practice some points are combined with a specific grind. As an example, a French point blade is usually flat ground.A <b>hollow</b> <b>grind</b> produces a thinner blade than the flat grind because it removes more material from the blade (hollows or thins the blade more). The hollow-ground blade flexes more easily and provides more feedback on the resistance the blade meets while cutting the hair, which is an indicator of blade sharpness. Hollow-ground blades are preferred by most barbers and some high-end razor manufacturers limit their production exclusively to hollow ground razors.|$|E
5000|$|Convex grind — Rather than {{tapering}} {{with straight}} {{lines to the}} edge, the taper is curved, though in the opposite manner to a <b>hollow</b> <b>grind.</b> Such a shape keeps a lot of metal behind the edge making for a stronger edge while still allowing a good degree of sharpness. This grind {{can be used on}} axes and is sometimes called an axe grind. As the angle of the taper is constantly changing this type of grind requires some degree of skill to reproduce on a flat stone. Convex blades usually need to be made from thicker stock than other blades. This is also known as hamaguriba in Japanese kitchen knives, both single and double beveled. Hamaguriba means [...] "clam-shaped edge".|$|E
5000|$|The shape, {{size and}} nature of the {{workpiece}} and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a <b>hollow</b> <b>grind),</b> but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible coated abrasive (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a coated abrasive to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively appied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of [...] "grainless finish" [...] called, in this case, a [...] "mirror finish".|$|E
50|$|Different knives are {{sharpened}} differently {{according to}} grind (edge geometry) and application. For example, surgical scalpels are extremely sharp but fragile, and are generally disposed of, rather than sharpened, after use. Straight razors used for shaving must cut with minimal pressure, and thus {{must be very}} sharp with a small angle and often a <b>hollow</b> <b>grind.</b> Typically these are stropped daily or more often. Kitchen knives are less sharp, and generally cut by slicing rather than just pressing, and are steeled daily. At the other extreme, an axe for chopping wood will be less sharp still, and is primarily used to split wood by chopping, not by slicing, and may be reground but will not be sharpened daily. In general, but not always, the harder the material to be cut, the higher (duller) {{the angle of the}} edge.|$|E
