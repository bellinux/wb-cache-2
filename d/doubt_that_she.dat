5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
25|$|In the market-place of Mirlemont, {{the people}} of the town gather for the beauty contest. A {{competitor}} crowned with lilies enters with her supporters, but most of the townspeople <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will win.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sure that}} she was {{frequently}} bewildered by the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> really understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 August 2011, in {{the first}} round of the US Open, Watson lost in three sets to former {{champion}} Maria Sharapova. After the match, Sharapova stated [...] "There's no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> a great up-and-coming player".|$|R
500|$|After {{a week of}} {{tracking}} her down through Starr's management, Mottola {{got in touch with}} Carey and brought her over to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, [...] "like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me." [...] She {{has said that}} she has struggled with <b>doubt,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believes in an afterlife, and that her faith plays a part in her books. In a 2012 radio interview, {{she said that she}} was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.|$|E
500|$|Citron's {{relationship}} with his wife was debated because historians <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> betrayed him, since {{she gave birth to}} their child shortly after his death. Madsen was sure the betrayal happened, but he took the liberty of affirming the couple did not get back together. Madsen declared, [...] "I do not think it is morally tarnished to show that people have affairs with people they are not married to. It's a beautiful description of a relationship that falls apart in a time that had great personal cost." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{answered}} him {{only by a}} look, but that look {{was so full of}} misery--of misery, blended with inexpressible love--that no one seeing her, could have <b>doubted</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would indeed be desolate when he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|Carroll {{had found}} the direct attack {{effective}} in Evelyn's case, and he determined to try it again. [...] "Then," [...] he began, [...] "it says {{a good deal for}} your courage."

500|$|The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a {{sidewalk}} along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, California, {{with more than}} 2,000five-pointed stars to honor artists for their achievement in the entertainment industry. Madonna was selected for the honor in 1990 but she showed no interest and the invitation has now expired. Walk of Fame spokeswoman Ana Martinez-Holler stated {{that in order to}} receive a star, Madonna would have to be [...] "resubmitted for a nomination," [...] adding, [...] "since she is not interested, I highly <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will give a nominator the permission to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Miranda tells Andy {{that she}} wants the new {{unpublished}} Harry Potter book for her daughters and, if Andy cannot find a copy, she will be fired. Andy desperately attempts to find the book and nearly gives up, but ultimately obtains it through Christian's contacts. She surprises Miranda by not only finding the book but having copies sent to the girls at the train station, leaving no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> accomplished Miranda's [...] "impossible" [...] task, thus saving her job. Andy gradually begins to outperform Emily at her job, and slowly but surely becomes more glamorous and begins aligning herself, unwittingly at first, to the [...] Runway philosophy.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries her up the stairs to the bedroom, where the audience is left in no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who were}} {{outside of the}} Key West Bar said Morris was {{incapable}} of standing on her own, {{and had to be}} helped into the police car. They <b>doubted</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have been capable, just minutes later, of getting out of the police car on her own and walking away as police officers reported.|$|R
5000|$|The filly {{was sent}} into {{training}} with Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden {{in all of}} her races by Jamie Spencer. She was an unusually small Thoroughbred: horse blankets designed for standard-sized horses trailed below her knees and some commentators described her as [...] "pony-sized" [...] and <b>doubted</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would ever make a top-class racehorse.|$|R
50|$|Joey {{is equally}} baffled, and begs Stranahan not to report <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is still alive. Since {{she has no}} idea yet why he tried to kill her, <b>she</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can {{convince}} the police that it wasn't a drunken accident or attempted suicide. Instead, she wants to find out herself why he did it, and drive her husband to insanity by building on his vanity and paranoia. Stranahan agrees.|$|R
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|One evening, Starr took Carey to {{a record}} {{industry}} gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey; as she handed him the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, {{and said that he}} would tend to [...] "the project". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> tempered her husband's more radical views. Immediately following his wife's death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 [...] "The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the death of my wife." [...] Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech [...] "almost communistic" [...] and went on to attribute Rosebery's [...] "shocking and disappointing" [...] behaviour to the fact that [...] "poor Lady Rosebery is not there to keep him back." [...] While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics. The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, Prince Albert. It seems that the Queen's antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery's cousin Ferdinand de Rothschild and toured Waddesdon Manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.|$|E
5000|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner gave Faith's {{version of}} the song {{four out of five}} stars. He stated [...] "It's a brave task to reinterpret a much-loved hit, but Faith's soulful tones {{immediately}} thwart any <b>doubts</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can't do the song justice." [...] He added that while it was always going to be tough topping the original, Faith comes [...] "admirably close." ...|$|R
50|$|Debbonaire {{was elected}} as the MP for Bristol West in May 2015, and was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer just weeks afterwards. Debbonaire said <b>she</b> never <b>doubted</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would return to Parliament and credited listening to classical music with helping her recovery. She subsequently called on Parliament to allow for MPs to vote remotely after she was unable to participate in votes during her recovery.|$|R
6000|$|Dora had {{the same}} yellow curly hair, in tight, frizzly rings all over her head, like a boy's, a light complexion, and blue eyes, in a round, pug-nosed face; and she hung so entirely on Harold <b>that</b> I never <b>doubted</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was his sister till, as we were sitting down to eat, I said, [...] "Can't you come a little way from your brother?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} {{the authenticity of}} Douglas' folk collecting, particularly of folk song and dance. Although there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did much collecting, there is also little <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> invented or herself composed much of this material. Douglas' fabrication of much material is partly explained by her ultimate aim being to repopularise Manx culture rather than its mere preservation. This {{is one of the}} key themes and successes of Douglas' life and work, as expressed in her reaction to the reception of these early dance reconstructions: ...|$|E

50|$|Fiona then {{encounters}} Gina, who, {{after losing}} her job, is finding {{it difficult to}} adjust to being unemployed. Fiona tries to help her find a good job, but <b>doubting</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can work herself at such a low level as a receptionist, <b>she</b> tells Gina <b>that</b> there is a job opening in Yukon Canneries in Alaska as a shipping specialist. Some time later, Austen promotes her and she prepares for her new job in London.|$|R
60|$|As {{for the old}} lady, {{you know}} her as well as I do. She's only the one fault. If you don't keep your eye lifting she would give away the roof off the station. Well, it seems it's natural in Kanakas. She's turned a {{powerful}} big woman now, and could throw a London bobby over her shoulder. But that's natural in Kanakas too, and there's no manner of <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> an A1 wife.|$|R

2500|$|Clinton {{announced}} {{formation of}} her exploratory committee on January 20, 2007, with a post on her website.

[...] She filed the official paperwork for an exploratory committee.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} mental illness in Charles's family. His ancestor, Queen Joanna, {{was said to}} have become insane early in life, and became known as [...] "Joanna the Mad". Many historians now <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was insane, and instead think she had {{depression}} from losing many members of her family {{in a short period of}} time, with the death of her husband Philip the Handsome being the last straw.|$|E
2500|$|Result: There {{was very}} little in the {{difference}} of amounts raised for their charities with Brenda slightly ahead of Nicky in the end. Although Bill questioned Brenda's team management skills noting that some of her energy had dwindled in the final task - he felt compelled to hire her because of her constant performance throughout the series. [...] Bill gave Nicky credit for being a great contestant and said that he had no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be picked up by a company.|$|E
