50|$|Due to the {{rear-mounted}} engine, {{the differential}} lies between the transmission and engine, so {{drive to the}} transmission from the engine is carried forward via a hollow turbine shaft from the engine mounted torque converter to the transmission gearbox. Power from the gearbox was carried rearward again to the differential pinion gear via yet another, concentric hollow shaft of larger diameter. A small concentric shaft inside the turbine shaft operated the <b>front</b> <b>pump</b> of the transmission to permit engagement of drive/reverse ranges when the car was stopped or moving slowly; at speeds over 15 mph, a differential-driven (from the car motion) rear pump of smaller capacity and greater efficiency took over and the <b>front</b> <b>pump</b> shut down to improve fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|The Hydramatic {{was fitted}} with two pumps to {{pressurize}} its {{hydraulic control system}} and provide lubrication of internal components. The <b>front</b> <b>pump</b> was a variable displacement vane unit driven from the fluid coupling housing, which meant oil pressure would be available immediately upon starting the engine. A relatively constant pressure was maintained by moving a slide inside the pump, which {{had the effect of}} changing the pump's displacement and therefore the volume of oil being delivered.|$|E

These improvements allowed the 4R75W to handle more power while being more efficient and economical. While not used on all 2003 model year vehicles, the 4R75W/E transmissions eventually replaced the 4R70W/E.|$|E

At higher speeds, the rear pump provided all the oil volume that was needed to operate the transmission and the <b>front</b> <b>pump's</b> slide was nearly centered, causing that pump to produce little output.|$|R

5000|$|Spring-piston air guns (or simply [...] "spring guns" [...] or [...] "springers") operate {{by means}} of a coil {{spring-loaded}} piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly. The cocking causes the pump piston to move backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the pump outlet (located to the <b>front</b> of the <b>pump)</b> is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as [...] "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the heat generated, and lead to combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.|$|R

50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (drive-on, drive-off) launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, hydraulic oil tank for the <b>front</b> axle, hydraulic <b>pumps,</b> cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the dead-man control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground speed which corresponds to engine speed and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|R

The pump had an open faced impeller of 33. 65 cm diameter with 5 blades of backswept design. It was felt {{that the best way}} to resolve some of the questions related to Hossain?s results was to determine the fluid velocity field inside the pump. Thus the flow field through the impeller passages was measured using a 1 -D Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system. The LDV was used to measure the radial and tangential velocity components as well as the turbulence intensities over the region accessible through the two optical windows in the <b>front</b> of the <b>pump</b> housing. Five axial planes were investigated by recording measurements along two radial lines at azimuthal angles of 45 ? and 315 ? (with respect to the horizontal axis of the pump) for design operating conditions. A once per revolution signal was used to supply the LDV system with a reference for the rotor position. It was found out that a leakage flow existed near the front wall of the impeller at z/h = 0. 11, which was generated by the pressure difference between the impeller exit and inlet. It was also concluded that the velocity field was not fully two-dimensional in nature. This was believed to be a result of the 90 ? turn that the fluid endures as it enters the impeller inlet from the suction pipe...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{infusion of}} drugs {{during the course}} of general anaesthesia is becoming more popular. This is because of the increasing number of suitable short-acting drugs, and the improve-ments and reduced cost of suitable delivery devices. The features of an ideal infusion device for use during general anaesthesia are that it should be: reliable, compact, easy to set up and use, battery powered; should use standard disposables (syringes/infusion sets); function independent of gravity; and should have a computer interface. The Graseby Medical MS 16 A pump (fig. 1) satisfies the majority of these requirements. It is a compact battery-operated syringe driver of the type used by diabetic patients. Its small size and light weight make it convenient to use in the ambulant patient, and it accommodates any size of syringe from 2 ml to 20 ml. The infusion rate (mm h" 1) of plunger travel is set by adjusting the two rotary dials on the <b>front</b> of the <b>pump.</b> Independent evaluation has found it to be reliable and accurate (Rithalia and Tinker, 1981; Health Equipment Information, 1982). Unfortunately, it lacks a facility for computer control, a feature important for the development of closed-loop administration systems, or for the automated delivery of multi-stage infusions of drugs. Commercial computer-controlled pumps are available, but are expensive. This paper describes a modification of the Graseby MS 16 A pump and an interface to allow its control by microcomputer. The interface was designed to be connected via the serial (RS 232) port that is found on most microcomputers. It could easily be modified to use a parallel port...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEffective {{mitigation}} {{plans are}} an absolutely {{critical component of}} mitigation plans for commercial-scale geologic carbon sequestration. One fundamental component of mitigation engineering design is immediate reduction of reservoir pressure. The Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP) is employing immediate reservoir pressure reduction as a primary mitigation tool in our geologic sequestration field projects. We are also employing multiple injection zones at the SWP deep saline injection site, both to maximize capacity and optimize mitigation plans. We developed models for each of our test sites to forecast optimum density and placement of injection and observation wells. Likewise, we designate certain observation wells as “observation-pressure- reduction,” or “OPR” wells. These are wells that serve as observation wells, but are engineered for quick conversion to production (pumping) wells to facilitate immediate pressure reduction, if needed. Results of our reservoir models suggest that immediate pressure reduction may stem geomechanical deformation, stem and/or close crack/fracture growths, shut down “piston-flow” displacement of brines into unintended reservoirs, slow leakage through wellbores, slow leakage of CO 2 through faults, and even induce closure of faults. Much like the injection wells, the distribution of such OPR wells is critical. For example, in ongoing Partnership field-testing, observation wells are being drilled that will serve as OPR wells, and we are using reservoir models to identify well locations that optimize both monitoring and mitigation potential. Reservoir model results also suggest that OPR wells {{can be converted to}} injection wells to maximize capacity and control reservoir pressure. For example, as one portion of the reservoir “fills” or if pressure control becomes problematic, the injection well can be converted to OPR mode, and the next well in the series (whether linear or in a grid design) can become an injection well. Simulation results suggest that if pressure reduction wells are used to “make space” for CO 2 by removing brine ahead of the CO 2 <b>front,</b> this <b>pumping</b> will also increase residual gas trapping by promoting horizontal migration. Additional results of our reservoir models suggest several caveats and potential problematic processes: (1) rapid reduction of reservoir pressure decreases CO 2 density, potentially leading to accelerated buoyancy effects, (2) premature CO 2 breakthrough may occur in pressure reduction wells, (3) pressure reduction decreases solubility of CO 2 in the formation water, potentially leading to exsolution and undesired phase changes, and (4) finally, a detailed cost- analysis must accompany such an engineering approach, because reservoir pressures directly affect compression injection costs, e. g., it is possible that pressure reduction wells may reduce or increase net costs of injection, depending on costs associated with water production and handling at the pressure reduction wells. We will show results of this sequestration field engineering approach for specific field tests, including ongoing geologic sequestration field-testing in several U. S. sites, including projects in Utah, New Mexico and Texas. The authors gratefully acknowledge the U. S. Department of Energy and NETL for sponsoring this Southwest Partnership project...|$|R
40|$|Coherent keV photon energy x-rays {{have many}} {{applications}} for materials {{science at the}} shortest length and time scales. Unfortunately, there are relatively few options for coherent x-ray generation. One {{of the most promising}} methods is high harmonic generation, wherein a femtosecond driving laser pulse is coherently upconverted to the x-ray region of the spectrum. Recent work has shown that the maximum x-ray photon energy that can be generated via high harmonic generation scales favorably with the wavelength of the driving laser pulse. This has sparked an interest in using mid-infrared (3 - 5 _m) lasers to drive high harmonic generation. However, high harmonic generation necessitates a mJ level, kHz repetition rate, femtosecond driving laser. At present, there are no such lasers in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. This necessitates the development of new laser architectures for tabletop coherent x-ray generation. OPCPA technology {{is one of the most}} promising avenues for high energy, high repletion rate lasers in the mid-infrared. This thesis reports on the design and development of a mJ level, kHz repetition rate, femtosecond OPCPA laser running at 3 μm, optimized for tabletop coherent x-ray generation. The system described here integrates and extends a variety of laser technologies towards this goal. The full laser is based upon an Yb:_ber oscillator and MgO:PPLN OPO <b>front</b> end.

5000|$|Canada's Worst Gas Station: The {{candidates}} are each put {{at the wheel}} of a different type of car and asked to pull in at a pump (only one of which will be available at any one time, and only four available overall) at a makeshift filling station. All five cars will be driving around the gas station, leaving the course only when they have successfully filled up with gas. Any mistake is punished by being forced to leave the gas station and drive a full loop around the course. As a trap, two diesel pumps are present, which will destroy the engine of the cars if they are used. Flora nearly gets to {{be the first one to}} fill up, but during her parallel parking attempt, she pulls so far forward that Diane is able to drive into the spot. Diane herself ends up hitting the car directly in front of her however, and is forced to take the first penalty lap. In the meantime, Flora manages to successfully park in <b>front</b> of the <b>pump,</b> but this time a careless mistake costs her dearly, as she forgets to turn off her engine before trying to fill the tank (a mistake which Andrew notes carries a $135 fine in Ontario), and is forced to take a penalty lap. Diane re-enters from her own penalty lap and almost immediately gets to a pump and fills up, becoming the first to pass the challenge. In a bizarre move, Flora reverses into the next available pump in a perpendicular fashion at Frank's urging, only for Frank to then berate her for blocking the other drivers; this earns her another penalty lap. Kevin nearly becomes the second driver to fill up, but in a repeat of the previous challenge, fails to use his mirrors and backs into a post. As Kevin leaves for his penalty lap, Margherita backs into the space, finding parallel parking much easier in the smaller car, and becomes the second driver to fill up. Azim quickly becomes the third driver to fill up, leaving just Flora and Kevin. After the two dodge a trap when one of the diesel pumps becomes available, they both back into the last available unleaded pump at awkward angles and then fight over the nozzle. Kevin technically becomes the final driver to fill up, but is judged to have failed the challenge due to his behaviour in doing so (which causes Andrew to brand him [...] "Canada's Worst Gas-Getter"), while Flora is left without a pump at all.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{developing}} new techniques for generating doughnut-shaped beams with a radial polarization state or a vortex phase <b>front.</b> An all-fibre-based <b>pump</b> beam conditioning element {{based on a}} tapered capillary fibre has been developed to provide a ring-shaped pump beam for end-pumped solid-state lasers. This unique pumping scheme provides a simple, efficient and robust approach for generating the doughnut-shaped first higher-order Laguerre-Gaussian (LG 01) mode due to its optimized spatial overlap for the LG 01 mode. However, the analysis of mode composition shows the doughnut-shaped LG 01 mode is apt to be a ‘hybrid’ mode consisting of TEM 01 modes with orthogonal orientations and LG 01 modes with opposite handedness of helical phase front at axial modes with different frequencies. A novel mode selection element consisting of two nanoscale thickness aluminium strips has been developed by exploiting {{the fact that the}} standing wave intensity distribution for the LG 01 + and LG 01 - modes inside a laser resonator are different. This scheme has been demonstrated {{for the first time in}} a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser to generate an LG 01 mode with controllable handedness of helical phase front at output powers ~ 1 W. Using the ring-shaped pumping scheme, direct generation of a radially-polarized beam has been successfully demonstrated in a Nd:YAG laser by exploiting the fact that the radially-polarized and azimuthally-polarized beams have slightly different spatial overlaps with the ring-shaped pump beam due to bifocusing within the laser crystal, thus resulting in a different threshold for each mode. The ring-shaped pumping scheme also provides flexibility in transverse mode selection and a significant reduction in adverse thermal lensing effects, offering the prospect of power scalability in end-pumped lasers. 14 W of linearly-polarized TEM 00 mode output with a beam quality factor (M 2) < 1. 1 and 16 W of linearly-polarized doughnut-shaped LG 01 mode with M 2 < 2. 2 were obtained in a Nd:YVO 4 laser with a slope efficiency of 53 % and 55 %, respectively. The results showed a reduction in thermal lens strength by approximately 30 % compared with traditional fibre-coupled laser diode end pumping. Furthermore, I have investigated extracavity conversion to radial polarization in both 1 µm and 2 µm regimes using continuously space-variant lambda/ 4 or lambda/ 2 waveplates (also called S-waveplates), fabricated by a recently developed femtosecond writing technique. In the one-micron wavelength regime, the lambda/ 2 S-waveplate can transform a linearly polarized Gaussian beam into a radially polarized beam with a conversion efficiency of ~ 75 % and M 2 of 2. 7, whilst the lambda/ 4 S-waveplate can transform a circularly polarized LG 01 mode into radial polarization with a conversion efficiency of ~ 86 % and M 2 of 2. 9. The S-waveplate has a much better performance in longer wavelength regime due to reduced Rayleigh scattering. We demonstrate highly efficient conversion (~ 86 %) to radial polarization in the 2 µm band with wavelength tuning from 1950 nm to 2100 nm by using a 2 µm lambda/ 2 S-waveplate. The resulting radially polarized beam had a M 2 of 2. 1 and a maximum polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 17. 5 dB at 2050 nm with a variation of less than 3 dB over the full wavelength range. I finally exploited the lambda/ 2 S-waveplate as an intracavity polarization-controlling element to directly excite radially-polarized TM 01 mode operation in an Yb-doped fibre laser. The laser yielded ~ 32 W of output power with a radially-polarized TM 01 mode output beam at 1040 nm with a slope efficiency of 66 % and polarization purity of 95 %. Moreover, I have demonstrated a simple technique for selectively generating the fundamental LP 01 mode and the next higher order doughnut-shaped LP 11 mode with a vortex phase front in an Yb-doped fibre laser. This approach exploits the difference in polarization behaviour of individual transverse modes due to transverse variation of birefringence in a few-moded fibre, allowing robust mode discrimination through the use of an appropriately aligned intracavity polarizing element. The laser yielded ~ 36 W of output power for both transverse modes with slope efficiency of 74 % and a mode purity of 95 %...|$|R
