25|$|Coming as {{they did}} during the mid- to late-1930s, sound films in Korea faced much harsher {{censorship}} from the Japanese government-General than did the silent films before them. Also, {{the loss of the}} byeonsa narrators with the coming of sound film meant that anti-authority messages could no longer be sneaked around the censors in this way. On such example occurred with the importation of the American silent film Ben Hur (1927) into Korea. While Japanese colonial censors failed to find anything possibly inflammatory about the film, the byeonsa immediately recognized and alerted audiences to the obvious parallels between the conditions of the Jews onscreen with those of the Koreans under Japanese colonial rule resulting in the <b>film</b> <b>setting</b> off a near riot.|$|E

Given Britain's role in the First and Second Opium Wars during the Victorian era and the foreign domination of China through [...] "unequal treaties", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, [...] "Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century." ...|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{chose to}} shoot the film in the {{anamorphic}} format on 35 mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic look they wanted for the <b>film</b> <b>setting.</b> Abrams and Mindel used lens flares throughout filming to create an optimistic atmosphere and a feeling that activity was taking place off-camera, making the Star Trek universe feel more real. [...] "There's something about those flares, especially in a movie that potentially could be incredibly sterile and CG and overly controlled. There's just something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them." [...] Mindel would create more flares by shining a flashlight or pointing a mirror at the camera lens, or using two cameras simultaneously and therefore two lighting set-ups. Editor Mary Jo Markey later said in interview {{that he had not}} told her (or fellow editor Maryann Brandon) this, and initially contacted the film developers asking why the film seemed overexposed.|$|E
50|$|On a <b>film</b> <b>set</b> {{and within}} most themed attractions, {{many of the}} {{buildings}} are only facades, which are far cheaper than actual buildings, and not subject to building codes (within <b>film</b> <b>sets).</b> In <b>film</b> <b>sets,</b> they are simply held up with supports from behind, and sometimes have boxes for actors {{to step in and}} out of from the front if necessary for a scene. Within theme parks, they are usually decoration for the interior ride/attraction/restaurant, which is based on a simple building design.|$|R

500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first <b>film,</b> <b>setting</b> several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "familiar territory of out-of-control, angry teens". If most performances [...] "are there in service of the spectacular splatter", [...] "capping to off" [...] is Lychee, [...] "its heart". What can be highlighted, in her opinion, is the art direction and production design; the <b>film</b> <b>setting</b> has cityscapes [...] "that Philip K. Dick would be proud of". The music was compared to [...] and {{was said to be}} [...] "a sometimes discordant soundtrack that adds to the overall atmosphere". The Japan Times critic Mark Schilling described it [...] "as if the Marquis de Sade had penned Peter Pan" [...] because of is horror elements. Indeed, [...] "just when the film is becoming a mash-up of Beauty and the Beast and Pinocchio, with [...] fulfilling his dream of love and manhood, twists multiply and the pace quickens. And we are abruptly reminded why the film's 'horror' label still applies." [...] Schilling criticized the characters portrayal that seemed [...] "more like manga archetypes than flesh-and-blood boys" [...] and its good versus evil dichotomy calling it [...] "as black-and-white as a folktale's (or a commercial manga's), making its surprises less than surprising — save perhaps for the last." ...|$|E
