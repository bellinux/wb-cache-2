The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale,</b> or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E

The letter reported that a brigantine, loaded with coffee and West Indian indigo from La Guaira, was boarded by pirates on June 12. The hijackers ordered the ship brought to Mona Island (incorrectly anglicized as [...] "Monkey Island"), a small island in the eponymous passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, where its captain and crew were ordered to unload the cargo.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the low prices they offer, Chinese traders have not only been able to outcompete large Senegalese merchants in Dakar, but have also begun to {{displace}} diasporic Lebanese from their traditional position as the market-dominant minority there as well; members of those two groups have begun to shift to a business pattern of buying goods from the Chinese and reselling them in more remote areas of the country where no Chinese migrants live.

50|$|Zheng Jing also {{recruited}} {{his early}} tutor, Chen Yong-hua, and passed to him most official government affairs. This saw {{the establishment of}} many important developmental policies for Taiwan in education, agriculture, trade, industry and finance, {{in addition to a}} tax system almost as harsh as that of the Dutch colonials. Taiwan soon saw the establishment of Chinese language schools for both the Chinese and indigenous populations and a concerted effort to break Dutch and Indigenous religious, language, and other cultural influences, and promotion of Chinese socio-cultural hegemony along with further expansion of towns and farmland into the south and east. This was realised in the eventual closure of all European and therefore Christian schools and churches in Taiwan, the opening of Confucian temples and the institution of the Confucian civil service exams to coincide with the implemented Confucian education system. Chen Yong-hua is credited for the introduction of new agricultural techniques, such as water-storage for annual dry periods and the deliberate cultivation of sugar cane as a cash crop for trade with the Europeans, in addition to the cooperative unit machinery for mass refining of sugar. The island became more economically self-sufficient with Chen's introduction of mass salt drying by evaporation, creating much higher quality salt than by rock deposits which were found to be very rare in Taiwan. The Dutch had previously maintained a monopoly of trade of certain goods with the Aboriginal tribes across Taiwan, and this monopoly of trade was not only maintained under the Zheng regime, but was actively turned into a quota-tribute system of exploitation of the native tribes to aid in international trade. Trade with the British occurred from 1670 through {{until the end of the}} Zheng regime, though for the most part limited because of the Zheng monopoly on sugar cane and deer hide, as well as the inability of the British to match the price of East Asian <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale.</b> Throughout its existence, Tungning was subject to the Qing sea ban (haijin), limiting its trade with mainland China to smugglers. Aside from the British, Zheng major trade occurred with the Japanese and Dutch, though evidence of trade with many Asian countries exists.|$|E

40|$|Keen to {{show the}} {{fluidity}} of border areas, {{and the limits of}} state control, much anthropological scholarship on borders highlights arrangements, activities and opportunities that pass beneath the official radar. But while such a clandestine focus casts border dwellers as preoccupied with resisting state regulation, this article shows how Zimbabwean–South African border dwellers make the most of their location by being visible to state officials, as waged farm workers. They seek agricultural jobs as a foothold in building lucrative businesses. Moreover, waged farm workforces are hubs of border trade, as workers remit <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> {{as a response to the}} crisis at home in Zimbabwe. The article therefore questions the wider theoretical opposition between the creative entrepreneurship of the informal economy and the drudgery of formal employment. Formal and informal modes of livelihood constitute one another, intersect and are interdependent. This article unpacks the spatial and temporal articulations between waged work and other means of making ends meet. In so doing, it suggests fixating less on the border itself as a distinctive feature, replete with smugglers and murky goings-on, and appreciating the various meanings of work in borderland economies...|$|E
40|$|Firms that enter {{foreign markets}} must {{decide on the}} extent to which they will {{internalize}} their distribution channels. There is a continuum of choice, ranging from one extreme where the firm performs all marketing and distribution functions itself, to the other where intermediaries take title to <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> to foreign wholesalers or customers. The integration decision is a strategic one as the right balance between hierarchy and market can make the difference between success or failure in a foreign market. This paper reports the results of an empirical test of a transaction cost model of channel integration decisions among Canadian computer software exporters. The software industry provides a variety of experiences with respect to product customization and distribution channels within the same aggregate product category. Data on channel choice, channel volume, asset specificity, and external uncertainty were collected from Canadian computer software exporters via a mail survey. The results suggest that channel volume, asset specificity, volatility, and product customization have a significant effect on channel choice.

40|$|The {{trade margins}} (or {{distributive}} margins) matrix {{represents one of}} the most relevant aggregate in a input-output framework. Consequently, the distributive margin is a typical issue of National Accounts, where the trade service is quantified by the differences between the value of the sales and the value of purchases of <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale.</b> In this paper we describe the principal steps of the procedure for the construction of this matrix for Italy. The proposed methodology is founded on the business statistics approach and tries to answer to the question “who sell what and to whom?”. The data collected from the enterprises, at a very detailed level of classification, provide a good representation of the “distributive channels ” (e. g. supermarkets, traditional grocery stores) but it needed an integration with information related to the economic destination of products (householders, enterprises, etc.) and to the different products sold by each commercial firm. Using the trade margins matrix we can reconstruct all the transactions from the production to the consumption of a good (the trade filières). For this reason, the trade margins matrix is also a very important tool for the economic analysis...|$|E

PRODCOM (Products of the European Community) is a European Union (EU) wide survey of production mainly for the manufacturing industries collected under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3924 / 91. PRODCOM is classified to the Commerce Energy and Industry National Statistics Theme Group. Manufacturing (excluding recycling) and mineral extraction are sub-divided into a list of around 3, 800 products. Companies selected for PRODCOM supply value sales data (as a proxy for production) for the products they manufacture, as well as non-manufacturing income. In addition, companies in approximately {{three quarters of the}} covered industries supply volume sales data. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. You may consider applying for other business data to assist your research. For the sixth edition (May 2016), an updated version of the 2010 data file, the final data files for 2012 and 2013, and the intermediate data file for 2014 have been added. Main Topics : Businesses are asked for the value of sales for all of their products. Some industries are also asked for the volume of products they manufacture. They are also asked <b>for</b> merchanted <b>goods</b> (<b>goods</b> purchased <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> without processing), work done (work done on material supplied by a customer), waste products (value of sales of waste products) and non-production income (income derived from provision of services and non-production activities). If sales of a particular product are less than £ 25, 000, these can be recorded as 'other sales' rather than being split by product...|$|R
