50|$|In the pet {{trade the}} African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> has gained some {{popularity}} though {{is still not}} as popular as the closely related leopard gecko. Unlike the leopard gecko, these geckos {{tend to be more}} docile but do have a higher humidity requirement. Through selective breeding the reptile trade has been able to produce numerous color variants of the African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> including tangerine, albino, patternless, black out, and aberrant fat-tails.|$|E
50|$|The Iranian <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> (Eublepharis angramainyu) is {{a ground}} {{dwelling}} lizard native to Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria. Its diet is insectivorous but may eat smaller vertebrates. Like most lizards {{it has the}} ability to shed its tail (autotomy).|$|E
5000|$|Subcutaneous {{adipose tissue}} was likely {{responsible}} for streamlining {{the body of}} Mauriciosaurus, as is also seen in marine mammals. The presence of subcutaneous fat {{may account for the}} thick layers of tissue that constitute the third type of preserved soft tissue in the type specimen. On the tail, the small neural spines, haemal arches, and transverse processes suggest the hypaxial muscles of the tail were weak; the preserved cone of soft tissue around the tail thus plausibly represents contour fat, which served to stabilize the tail while continuing the outline of the torso onto the tail in a manner not unlike <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> and other geckos. This forms a [...] "drop-shaped" [...] hydrodynamic body outline, with the thickest part of the body being located in the front third, and the torso and tail forming a single cohesive unit.|$|R
50|$|The ocelot gecko (Paroedura pictus) is a nocturnal ground-dwelling gecko {{found in}} leaf litter in Madagascar forests, {{and is also}} a popular pet. It is {{sometimes}} known as the Madagascar ground gecko, pictus gecko, Malagasy <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko,</b> or panther gecko.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> {{is found}} in West Africa, from Senegal to Cameroon. Their habitat is dry and arid, {{although}} they will {{spend most of their}} time in a dark, humid hiding place. In captivity, it is important to provide these geckos with a source of humidity that mimics these conditions.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is {{from the}} {{subfamily}} Eublepharinae. Members of this subfamily include the leopard gecko of south Central Asia, India, and Pakistan. This subfamily has clearly different characteristics from other geckos. They are terrestrial and nocturnal, and have moveable eyelids, vertical pupils, and no adhesive lamellae (sticky feet).|$|E
50|$|The African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is {{typically}} around 7-9 inches (18-23cm), with females being slightly smaller than males. They have a captive lifespan of 10-25 years. Normal coloring is brown and tan/beige stripes, {{with a possible}} thin white stripe {{along the length of}} the back. The underbelly is pale pink or off-white.|$|E
50|$|Hemitheconyx caudicinctus or the African <b>Fat-tailed</b> <b>Gecko,</b> {{occurs in}} the West African {{countries}} of Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Mali, and Ivory Coast. It is primarily a scrub to desert inhabitant, and {{has become one of}} the most popular lizards in the pet trade (where this specimen originated) due to its striking appearance, velvety skin, and docile nature.|$|E
50|$|Other {{reptiles}} - White line gecko, African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko,</b> leopard gecko, Standing's day gecko, Madagascar giant day gecko, tokay gecko, Nile monitor, crocodile monitor, Gila monster, eastern glass lizard, frilled lizard, Sudan plated lizard, blue spiny lizard, northern blue-tongued skink, broadhead skink, Solomon Islands skink, Great Plains skink, panther chameleon, green iguana, green crested basilisk, common snakeneck turtle, {{spiny softshell}} turtle, African spurred tortoise, alligator snapping turtle, and the American alligator.|$|E
5000|$|The African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is {{equipped}} {{with the ability to}} lose its tail when threatened or attacked. If the tail is lost, the new tail will have a more rounded shape, similar to the head. It may not match the body coloration and pattern of the gecko. The tail is also where they store their fat, an important energy reserve. With its tail, an African fat tailed gecko can go days on end without food.|$|E
5000|$|Laura P. Nichols Cheetah Outpost - This exhibit {{was opened}} on July 7, 2012. This exhibit educates {{visitors}} about cheetah conservation efforts and African wildlife. Along with the cheetah, Kirk's dik-dik {{and the blue}} crane {{can be seen in}} front of the outpost. Inside the outpost, the naked mole rat, Angolan python, African Bullfrog, mole snake, Sudan plated lizard, African spurred tortoise, Standing's day gecko, and the African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> can be seen. The crested porcupine can also be seen on a viewing platform outside of the outpost.|$|E
5000|$|Leopard geckos {{were first}} {{described}} as a species by zoologist Edward Blyth in 1854 as Eublepharis macularius. [...] The generic name Eublepharis {{is a combination of}} the Greek words eu (good) and blepharos (eyelid), as having eyelids is the primary characteristic that distinguishes members of this subfamily from other geckos, along with a lack of lamellae, bumpy skin, and crepuscular behavior. [...] The specific name macularius derives from the Latin word macula meaning [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "blemish", referring to the animal's natural spotted markings. Leopard geckos are related to many different geckos, such as the African <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> and the banded geckos. There are four other species within the Genus Eublepharis, leopard gecko, one of which was previously included as a subspecies of leopard gecko:In addition, there are five subspecies of leopard gecko.|$|E
