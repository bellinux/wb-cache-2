It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E

25|$|Advocates of {{separation}} of church and state have questioned the legality of this motto, asserting that it is a violation of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the government from passing any law respecting the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> Religious accommodationists state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the results}} of the {{persecution}} in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished – but they did not seek religious freedom, and early North American colonies were generally as intolerant of religious dissent as England; Puritan Massachusetts, for example, did not allow standard Church of England worship. Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose. After the American Colonies famously revolted against King George III of the United Kingdom, the Constitution of United States was specifically amended to ban the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> by Congress.|$|E

25|$|Modeling the {{provisions}} concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, {{the framers of}} the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that {{did not want to be}} under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.|$|E
25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

50|$|Daheshism (in Arabic الداهشية) is a {{religion}} established by Dr. Dahesh (real name Salim Moussa Achi) in 1942. He claimed Daheshism was a new religion based upon the Unity <b>of</b> <b>Religions.</b> He also established a Daheshism Calendar that starts with the 23rd of March, 1942, the date <b>of</b> the official <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>religion.</b>|$|R

500|$|Section116 {{reflects}} two {{provisions of}} the United States Constitution: the First Amendment, which prohibits the making of laws for the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and guarantees {{the free exercise of}} religion; and ArticleVI, Section3, which prohibits the imposition of religious tests for public offices. Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section116 a [...] "fairly blatant piece of transcription" [...] of its US counterparts. However, in practice, Section116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.|$|E
500|$|In the United States the Christian Science {{church has}} persuaded {{federal and local}} {{government}} to create and maintain religious-exemption statutes, using the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Free Exercise Clause (italicized) reads: [...] "Congress shall make no law respecting an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...." [...] Many of the exemptions say that in life-threatening situations children must have access to medical care, but without early access the seriousness of an illness may not be recognized, in part because Christian Scientists are discouraged from educating themselves about physical ailments.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "establishment of {{religion}}" [...] {{clause of}} the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion to another [...] [...] [...] {{in the words of}} Jefferson, the [...] clause against <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and State' [...] [...] [...] That wall must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{with you}} that {{religion}} is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should [...] "make no law respecting an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf {{of the rights of}} conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.|$|E
500|$|As {{described}} by Judge Louis H. Pollak in a 1999 article, Sawyer's [...] "theory {{of the case}} was that the prescribed Bible reading, whether or not followed by the Lord's Prayer, constituted both an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and an infringement of {{the free exercise of}} religion in contravention of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment." [...] The trial began in 1958 before a three-judge panel. The panel agreed in an opinion written by Judge John Biggs, Jr. After the trial, the state legislature changed the law to allow students to be excused from the Bible readings if they wished. In further hearings in 1962 the court, again in an opinion by Biggs, held that the law still violated the Constitution by allowing the state [...] "to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth." ...|$|E

50|$|The First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits laws {{advancing}} the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> any <b>religion.</b> Any government-sponsored religious instruction is thus barred.

500|$|The coins {{were sold}} {{to the public for}} $1 each through the Fifth National Bank and other outlets. Bulk sales were made to certain groups. The coins did not sell as well as expected, and 55,000 were returned, after which they were placed in circulation. [...] Relatively few are known in worn condition, causing author and coin dealer Q. David Bowers to {{conclude}} the public picked them out of pocket change. Money from the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar was used towards a celebration in New York in May 1924, during which the National Huguenot Memorial Church on Staten Island was dedicated. There was some debate in the pages of The Numismatist, the ANA's journal, both as to whether William and Coligny should have appeared on the coin since they {{had nothing to do with}} the voyage, and whether the Churches of Christ should be allowed to sponsor a coin in view of the First Amendment's prohibition of an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> There was controversy in the press, which criticized the inclusion of William and Coligny as irrelevant to the commemoration and as religious propaganda. This in 1925 made politically infeasible the attempts of Minnesota Representative Ole Juulson Kvale, a Lutheran pastor, to obtain a coin for the Norse-American Centennial; he instead settled for a congressionally authorized medal.|$|E
2500|$|The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, {{ratified}} {{along with}} the rest of the Bill of Rights on December 15, 1791, included the following words:"Congress shall make no law respecting an <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." ...|$|E

25|$|If {{religious}} {{exercises are}} held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage.... And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen, not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> secularism, or at least, as governmental support of the beliefs of {{those who think that}} religious exercises should be conducted only in private.|$|R
5000|$|Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux was {{a fierce}} republican and anti-Catholic, who had {{proposed}} to execute Louis XVI after {{the flight to}} Varennes. He promoted the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>religion,</b> theophilanthropy, to replace Christianity.|$|R
50|$|Incorporation of the Anti-Establishment Clause in 1947 {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} in several ways and subject to critique. The controversy surrounding Establishment Clause incorporation primarily {{stems from the fact}} that one of the intentions <b>of</b> the <b>Establishment</b> Clause was to prevent Congress from interfering with state <b>establishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> that existed at the time of the founding (at least six states had established religions at the founding) - a fact conceded by even those members of the Court who believe the Establishment Clause was made applicable to the states through incorporation. Critics have also argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is understood to incorporate only individual rights found in the Bill <b>of</b> Rights; the <b>Establishment</b> Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause (which critics readily concede protects individual rights), does not purport to protect individual rights.|$|R
