25|$|Returning {{home in the}} 1850s, Constantin {{married a}} second time, to Ecaterina Sturza. This granddaughter of Prince Ioan Sturdza was {{reportedly}} very ugly but also highly intelligent and energetic; she was Dumitru's mother. Born in Iași, Dumitru spent his first four years at Făurei, which he later declared to be his <b>favorite</b> <b>place</b> in the world. During that interval, his father became rivals with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica. In 1854, {{at the height of}} the Crimean War, Constantin and his family crossed from Moldavia-proper into Bessarabia (a Russian governorate, formerly part of Moldavia). This was done upon orders from the Austrian occupation authorities, on a request from the Ottoman army, or, alternatively, from Prince Ghica himself. Constantin was naturalized Russian and was possibly a Russian agent of influence in Moldavia. In the 1860s, he was directly involved in Russian censorship of Moldavian liberal newspapers and magazines.|$|E

The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A few of us were standing behind the stage and vividly remember the feeling of this is the new Blink.

2500|$|The town of Zihuatanejo's main {{attraction}} is its bay, which is well-protected from open ocean.

The town’s five water treatment plants can no longer keep up with demand, with some untreated wastewater and sediment flowing into the bay. There has also been some wholesale destruction of the hills right on the bay to create development space, and there is concern about damage to the local coral reef. Some development projects, such as a dock for cruise ships and Punta del Mar (a complex of hotels, villas, pools and a marina) have been delayed due to the need for environmental impact studies.|$|E
