5|$|During {{his stay}} in France, Day {{regularly}} corresponded with Edgeworth. He said that both girls were passionate about their studies, Sabrina more so. Day also related anecdotes, one concerning a {{trip on the}} Rhone where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He <b>described</b> <b>an</b> incident in which he challenged a French Army officer to a duel, even producing a set of dueling pistols, simply as a manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He <b>described</b> <b>an</b> initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently <b>described</b> <b>an</b> animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, {{was the size of a}} cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{said that}} the angel {{returned}} the plates to him in September, 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed dictation. They worked full time on the manuscript between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued {{to work at the}} home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative <b>described</b> <b>an</b> institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. Dictation was completed around July 1, 1829.|$|E
5|$|The SEC {{announced}} it had filed civil fraud complaints against Andersen. A few days later, sources claimed Enron and Dynegy were renegotiating {{the terms of}} their arrangement. Dynegy now demanded Enron agree to be bought for $4 billion rather than the previous $8 billion. Observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining which of Enron's operations, if any, were profitable. Reports <b>described</b> <b>an</b> en masse shift of business to Enron's competitors {{for the sake of}} risk exposure reduction.|$|E
5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers <b>described</b> <b>an</b> incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He <b>described</b> <b>an</b> underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|By 1537 {{the area}} {{immediately}} {{north of the}} new colony of Guatemala was being {{referred to as the}} Tierra de Guerra ("Land of War"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz ("True Peace"). The Land of War <b>described</b> <b>an</b> area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement {{near the edge of the}} jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salamá, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post <b>described</b> <b>an</b> arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

In 1960, Lavocat returned to Africa and <b>described</b> <b>a</b> second species of Rebbachisaurus, R. tamesnensis. In 1973, Lavocat discovered two genera and three species of Miocene rodent, which he placed in the family Kenyamyidae.|$|R

5|$|However, in 1990 David W. Krause and Bonaparte {{argued that}} Gondwanatheria, {{including}} Ferugliotherium (family Ferugliotheriidae), Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica (family Sudamericidae), {{should be placed}} within Multituberculata. Two years later, Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska described additional material of Ferugliotherium (which they tentatively placed in the multituberculate suborder Plagiaulacoidea) and suggested that the supposed upper molars of Vucetichia were in fact heavily worn first lower molariforms (mf1) of Ferugliotherium. In 1993, Krause <b>described</b> <b>an</b> unworn mf1 of Ferugliotherium and confirmed that Vucetichia was based on worn specimens of Ferugliotherium and therefore a synonym of the latter. In the same year, he and Bonaparte argued once again that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica formed a closely related group of multituberculates, which they called the superfamily Gondwanatherioidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte described a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like lower fourth premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos in 1996 and tentatively identified it as Ferugliotherium. On {{the basis of the}} morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatherians were not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem <b>described</b> <b>an</b> actual event, it might {{identify}} the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, <b>described</b> <b>an</b> {{outbreak}} of typhoid {{linked to the}} consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol <b>described</b> <b>an</b> 1823 {{incident}} between Cofresí and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Gerónimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofresí intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofresí assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayagüez, where Goyco was freed. Cofresí explained that he knew Goyco's father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Gerónimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayagüez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofresí's family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis.|$|E
5|$|Sphecomyrma is an extinct genus of ants which {{existed in}} the Cretaceous {{approximately}} 79 to 92 million years ago. The first specimens were collected in 1966, found embedded in amber which had been exposed in the cliffs of Cliffwood, New Jersey, by Edmund Frey and his wife. In 1967, zoologists E. O. Wilson, Frank Carpenter and William L. Brown, Jr. published a paper describing and naming Sphecomyrma freyi. They <b>described</b> <b>an</b> ant with a mosaic of features, a mix of characteristics from modern ants and aculeate wasps. It possessed a metapleural gland, a feature unique to ants, it was wingless and possessed a petiole which was ant-like in form. The mandibles were short and wasp-like with only two teeth, the gaster constricted and the middle and hind legs had double tibial spurs. The antennae were, in form, midway between the wasps and ants, having a short first segment but a long flexible funiculus. Two additional species, S. canadensis and S. mesaki, were described in 1985 and 2005 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{published}} a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical {{issues raised by the}} Cold War and his own {{role in the development of}} atomic weapons. The title story <b>described</b> <b>an</b> international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E
