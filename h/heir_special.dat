5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or <b>heirs,</b> <b>special</b> agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative review {{on the existing}} legislation which regulates the status of forced heirs in legal systems on the territory of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Srpska). The paper gives {{an overview of the}} persons that are eligible for forced heirship, conditions for being recognized as forced heir, size of the forced share, as well as influence {{of the size of the}} legal shares on the position of forced <b>heirs.</b> <b>Special</b> attention is given to the analysis of the influence of possible changes in the size of legal shares of inheritance on the size of shares belonging to forced heirs. In this context it is concluded that legal status of forced heirs in most countries which belong to this group, is up to a certain extent specific compared to the one in most other contemporary European legal systems, primarily because of its volatile character. Simultaneously, it is observed that, regardless of a common legal background and inherited similarities dating from the former joint state, there are significant differences between the analyzed legal systems concerning the legal status of forced heirs. Through this comparative review, the author strives to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the legal provisions existing in legislation of these countries. In this aspect, the author expresses the opinion whether there is a need for modification in national legislation regarding the analyzed aspects of the regulated status of forced heirs...|$|R

In his opinion the Seventh-day Adventist is God's <b>special</b> <b>heir</b> of the Reformers. Only through the Adventist Church can the work of the Reformation be carried to its God-designed end.|$|R
50|$|After the {{creation}} of the special operations unit in 1981, the CTOE ceased to be just an instruction facility but also served as the HQ for the new Portuguese special operations unit. The unit members wear a grass green beret and are the <b>heir</b> of the <b>Special</b> Hunters: the beret badge includes a trumpet — a symbol of the Special Hunters; and the unit is known as Rangers because the instructors of the Special Hunters completed the Ranger Course and adapted the characteristics of that training to the Special Operations Course. The unit has operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, East-Timor, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the third}} son of Richard Dawson of Ardee by his wife Anne, {{daughter}} of Sir Edward O'Brien, 2nd Baronet, and after his father's death in 1782 he became heir-presumptive to his uncle Thomas Dawson, 1st Baron Dartrey. On 22 May 1784 he married Catherine, daughter of Colonel Arthur Graham of Hockley, county Armagh; they had one son and four daughters. Dawson {{was elected to the}} Irish House of Commons for County Monaghan in April 1797 through the influence of his uncle (now Viscount Cremorne), and was named as <b>heir</b> in the <b>special</b> remainder of the barony of Cremorne granted to his uncle in November of that year. He continued to represent Monaghan in the Irish Parliament until the Act of Union, and then sat for the same county in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom until his death in a Dublin Hotel. His son Richard Thomas Dawson succeeded as second Baron Cremorne in 1813.|$|R
50|$|Nicholas {{made his}} will as of Carshalton on 27 July 1497, making Robert Gainsford his {{principal}} <b>heir.</b> He made <b>special</b> charitable {{gifts to the}} 'Abbey of Martin', presumably Battle Abbey, (for {{the sake of the}} soul of his former servant John Miles), continuing his annual donations, and beseeching the prior to be as good a friend to his soul as he had been in time past to his person. The will was proved by the oath of his wife on 4 November 1498. His three other executors, who reserved their powers, were John Legh of Adlington, John Kirton, and William Buck. Buck was Master of the Fraternity of Taylors and Linen Armourers of St. John the Baptist (forerunner of the Merchant Taylors) in 1488-89 and was the first husband of Kirton's sister Margaret (died 1522), who (after Buck's death in 1502) married Sir Stephen Jenyns (Master of that Guild in 1490). Confusions have arisen because both Nicholas Gainsford and his wife in their wills refer to their grandchildren as 'son' or 'daughter' and to others (variously) as 'cosyn'. Margaret Gaynsford died in 1503.|$|R
5000|$|More so {{than other}} caliphs, Al-Ma’mun {{demonstrated}} a closeness {{with members of}} the Alid family and some of their doctrines, leading some scholars to suggest that he may have adopted some of their views. A distinguished religious scholar himself, al-Ma’mun’s letters to his prefects to initiate the inquisition seem to convey the notion that his knowledge and learning was at a higher level than that of the public or even other religious scholars, who were likened to the vulgar mob who have no insight or illumination on matters pertaining to God. [...] This view is similar to the Shi’i belief that the Imam alone held the esoteric knowledge regarding the Qur'an and matters of faith. In addition to adopting the title of imam, Al-Ma’mun extended special conciliatory gestures to the family of Alids, as evident in his designation of ‘Ali al-Rida as his <b>heir</b> and the <b>special</b> reverence he held for ‘Ali that he also made into a doctrine. Shi’ism, like Mu’tazilism, embraced the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an, therefore some scholars construe al-Ma’mun’s declaration of this doctrine and the Mihna as reflections of his partiality to Shi’ite doctrines, whereas suggesting that al-Mutawakkil’s revocation of the edict was in part rooted in his antagonism towards the Alids.|$|R
5000|$|Om Mntanga {{says about}} the Xhosa: [...] "According to Xhosa {{traditional}} custom, when a man dies his eldest son usually inherits his social position as household head. He also inherits land rights, cattle and material possessions". Monica Hunter {{says about the}} Pondo: [...] "From childhood there is a distinction between younger and elder brother. A younger brother is ordered about by his senior. After {{the death of the}} father the eldest brother, the heir, takes the place of the father, being responsible for the maintenance of the property and, if possible, of his younger brothers. They should give him their earnings, as they should their father. An elder brother is referred to as umkhuluwe, a younger as umninawe". It is said about the Venda:""Traditionally, all land is communal, under the trusteeship of the chief. However, every man has indisputable rights to the land he occupies and uses. His sons are entitled to the use of his land but may also ask the local headman to allocate fresh portions of land. Movable property—livestock, household utensils, and the proceeds of agriculture and trade—passes to the oldest son or, {{in the case of a}} polygynous marriage, the oldest son of the senior wife. This son becomes the undisputed head of the family unless he has disgraced himself in the eyes of the family, in which case the son next in line is appointed by the deceased's oldest sister with the consent of his brothers." [...] Among the Tsonga: [...] "Women do not inherit. The eldest son of the principal wife inherits the bulk of kraalproperty such as cattle and ploughs. No two siblings have the same status". It is said about the Ndebele of Zimbabwe: [...] "A husband will allocate land and livestock to his wives; the eldest son of the first wife is the principal heir and inherits this property". Among the Swazi, says Hilda Kuper in [...] "The Swazi: A South African Kingdom": [...] "The eldest son of each house is the heir to the property belonging to that house, and the heir to the general estate is the eldest son of the principal wife of the deceased. Often she is not pointed out as such until after her husband's death. the heir to the general estate of course is also <b>special</b> <b>heir</b> to the estate of his mother's house. These special estates become the general estates inherited by the next generation of heirs." [...] Phakama Shili writes in [...] "Social Inequalities: Inheritance Under Swazi Customary Law": [...] "under Swazi customary law women are not considered to inherit the estates of their late husbands and fathers. In terms of Swazi customary law there is only one heir who succeeds to the whole estate of the deceased and such person is chosen bylusendvo. Where the deceased headman had one wife, his eldest son, in the absence of factors which may disqualify him becomes heir. This therefore means that his siblings will not inherit but only benefit from the estate through their brother. This preference of the eldest son over his siblings and mother goes against the dictates of the Constitution which provides for equal treatment and non-discrimination of women. If the deceased dies having married to two or more wives, the lusendvo will choose the principal wife and the oldest son of that wife or house will become the main heir".|$|R
