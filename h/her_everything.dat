500|$|Dillard, the {{daughter}} of an oil company executive, grew up in an upper middle-class home in Pittsburgh. [...] She read voraciously; one of her favorite books was Ann Haven Morgan's The Field Book of Ponds and Streams, which she compared to the Book of Common Prayer; in painstaking detail, it instructed on the study and collection of plants and insects. [...] She attended Hollins College in Roanoke County, Virginia, receiving both a bachelor's (1967) and a master's degree (1968). [...] At Hollins she came under the tutelage of poet and creative writing professor Richard Henry Wilde Dillard, whom she married in 1965. [...] She would later state that Richard taught <b>her</b> <b>everything</b> she knew about writing. [...] Her master's thesis, [...] "Walden Pond and Thoreau", studied the eponymous pond as a structuring device for Henry David Thoreau's Walden. [...] Dillard's knowledge of Thoreau's works was an obvious inspiration, although critics have pointed to many differences between their two works. [...] However, in a nod to his influence, Dillard mentions within the text that she named her goldfish Ellery Channing, after one of Thoreau's closest friends.|$|E
500|$|Distinctively, Jasmine is not Aladdins protagonist, a role held instead by title {{character}} Aladdin, while Jasmine herself occupies a secondary {{role as the}} film's love interest, consequently lacking significant character development. However, sometimes both characters are collectively referred to as protagonists, while Jasmine is sometimes identified as the film's [...] "female protagonist". The First Novels Club observed that Jasmine essentially [...] "ends up the same person as when she started." [...] Little is known about Jasmine's interests, hobbies and goals. The Art of the Princess and the Frog author Jeff Kurrti wrote that although [...] "Jasmine is less prominent as a heroine... she made decisions and {{was a little more}} strong-willed". Samantha Rullo of Bustle agreed that, despite her secondary role, Jasmine remains [...] "determined to live her life the way she wants to, rather than letting others make her decisions for her", and thus ranks among Disney's most rebellious princesses. Jasmine's personality continues to rank among Disney's [...] "strongest" [...] heroines because she is not concerned about wealth or social class, despite her opulent upbringing. Similarly, Jasmine is not interested in marrying someone who is capable of only offering <b>her</b> <b>everything</b> she already owns, opting for excitement and companionship instead.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{opted not}} to hire A-list celebrities to voice the film's main characters. Afterwards, the {{directors}} continued to audition hundreds of young actresses {{in the hopes of}} finding Rapunzel's voice, among them Broadway performer Idina Menzel, but none sounded quite right until they finally discovered singer and actress Mandy Moore. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney character as [...] "the ultimate fantasy", Moore was a long-time fan of Disney films. Initially, knowledge that the role was being heavily sought after at the time deterred her from auditioning in favor of avoiding disappointment. Once she made up her mind to audition, Moore [...] "chased after" [...] the role, auditioning for it twice. Because the film is a musical requiring its cast to provide both their characters' speaking and singing voices, all candidates were asked to perform one song of their choice in the style of a singer-songwriter; Moore, a professional singer herself, auditioned with Joni Mitchell's [...] "Help Me". Child actress Delaney Rose Stein was eventually cast as a young version Rapunzel. According to co-director Byron Howard, Moore [...] "has this great soul to her voice" [...] as well as [...] "this down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that makes <b>her</b> <b>everything</b> you could hope for in a Disney heroine." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a {{great many}} tracts for the poor; like her novels for the middle class, they [...] "taught the lessons of {{personal}} endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status." [...] Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to [...] "larger economic and political forces." [...] In this, they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts, {{many of which were}} written by Hannah More. [...] As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women's literature, argues, Sherwood's tracts use a Biblical [...] "interpretative frame" [...] in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will [...] "behave wisely in the streets" [...] and [...] "not give [...] mind to self-pleasing." [...] Of course, she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy <b>her</b> <b>everything</b> she sees. [...] Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses, among other things, blue satin boots, a penknife, and a new hat with flowers, until the pair reach the undertaker's shop. There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson, recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: [...] "but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [...] (1 Timothy 5:6).|$|E
