However, the cost of cellulolytic enzymes limits the utilization of the low-cost bioresource. This study aimed to develop a consolidated bioprocessing without the need of supplementary cellulase for butyric acid production from lignocellulosic biomass. A stirred-tank reactor with a working volume of 21 L was constructed and operated in batch and semi-continuous fermentation modes with a cellulolytic butyrate-producing microbial community. The semi-continuous fermentation with <b>intermittent</b> <b>discharging</b> of the culture broth and replenishment with fresh medium achieved the highest butyric acid productivity of 2. 69 g/(L•d). In semi-continuous operation mode, the butyric acid and total carboxylic acid concentrations of 16. 2 and 28. 9 g/L, respectively, were achieved. Over the 21 -day fermentation period, their cumulative yields reached 1189 and 2048 g, respectively, corresponding to 41 % and 74 % of the maximum theoretical yields based {{on the amount of}} NaOH pretreated rice straw fed in.

In the context of urban drainage, the effects of dispersion may act to reduce peak concentrations associated with <b>intermittent</b> <b>discharges</b> or cause pollutants to be retained for longer or shorter durations than mean travel times would predict. With respect to surcharged manholes, previous research employed laboratory experiments to identify best-fit parameter values for the first-order advection-dispersion equation (ADE) and aggregated dead zone (ADZ) routing models. This paper presents data from a new set of smaller-scale laboratory measurements and demonstrates that the threshold depth separating two distinct hydraulic regimes can be identified independently of scale. However, the fitted ADE and ADZ routing model parameters are not generally amenable to conventional hydraulic scaling, because the models do not provide good fits to the observed data. An alternative approach is proposed based on the cumulative residence time distribution (CRTD). This approach is shown to be scalable and practical. The solute transport characteristics of a specific configuration of a surcharged manhole are shown to be characterized by just two dimensionless CRTDs corresponding to prethreshold and postthreshold surcharge depths...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} basins or in rivers characterized by <b>intermittent</b> <b>discharges,</b> with low or negligible/null observed values {{for long periods of}} the year, the correct representation of the discharge regime is important for issues related to water management and to define the amount and quality of water available for irrigation, domestic and recreational uses. In these cases, only one index as a statistical metric is often not enough; it is thus necessary to introduce Flow Duration Curves (FDC). The aim of this study is therefore to combine a stochastic index flow model capable of reproducing the FDC record period of a river, regardless of the persistence and seasonality of the series, with the theory of total probability in order to calculate how often a river is dry. The paper draws from preliminary analyses, including a study to estimate the correlation between discharge indicators Q 95, Q 50 and Q 1 (discharges exceeding 95 %, 50 % or 1 % of the time, respectively) and some fundamental characteristics of the basin, as well as to identify homogeneous regions in the target area through the study of several geomorphological features and climatic conditions. The stochastic model was then applied in one of the homogeneous regions that includes intermittent rivers. Finally, the model was regionalized by means of regression analysis in order to calculate the FDC for ungauged basins; the reliability of this method was tested using jackknife validation. ...|$|R
