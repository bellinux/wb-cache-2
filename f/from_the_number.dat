5000|$|Address numbers can be {{determined}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> or names of intersecting streets. Addresses on north-south routes, including exceptions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbering</b> and naming system, follow <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of intersecting (or implied intersections of) numbered streets. For example, 2005 South Glebe Road would lie just beyond the intersection of South Glebe Road and 20th Street South. Addresses on east-west, including exceptions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbering</b> and naming system, {{are based on the}} intersecting (or implied intersections of) named streets with each letter/syllable combination representing 100 address <b>numbers.</b> <b>The</b> chart below shows <b>the</b> block <b>numbers</b> on east-west streets. Full-Lot houses often skip 4 numbers in between houses, and town homes generally skip two; while {{the opposite side of the}} street is offset by one number, so that one side can be even, and one odd.|$|R

5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.|$|E
5|$|The Ecstatic was {{released}} by Downtown on June 9, 2009. In its first week, the album sold 39,000 copies and debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200, becoming the second record of Mos Def's career {{to reach the top}} ten on the chart. The following week, he became the first recording artist to endorse the Original Music Tee, a T-shirt featuring the album cover on the front, the track listing on the back, and a tag with a code to download an MP3 copy of the record. The marketing strategy led to enough sales that Billboard factored the T-shirts as album units on the magazine's music charts. The Ecstatic also benefited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of mentions it received on Internet blog posts, which peaked during the week of June 29. The album reached 168,000 copies sold in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|With {{the weather}} {{improving}} over the United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his counter stroke came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, delaying {{the start of}} the attack to the afternoon. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of German reinforcements arriving in the VIII Corps sector and aerial reconnaissance, O'Connor suspected that the Germans were organising a counter-stroke. XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving the VIII Corps right flank vulnerable, O'Connor postponed attacks by I Corps and ordered VIII Corps onto the defensive. Dempsey, privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German signal traffic, knew the counter-attack was coming and approved O'Connor's precautions. VIII Corps began to reorganise to meet the attack. Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Évrecy–Noyers-Bocage–Villers-Bocage area and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City {{was sent to}} Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of {{which had to be}} collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

5|$|Somerset's first {{match of}} 1885 {{commenced}} on 16 July 1885, over {{two months after}} Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first-class county cricket season in England. Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire, and after losing the toss were asked to field. Somerset's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175runs in the first innings, during which Bastard took a career-best eight wickets in the innings, conceding 54 runs (eight for 54) off his 38four-ball overs. In reply, Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153, Radcliffe top-scoring with 51runs. Bastard collected another three wickets in the second innings, granting him one of two career ten-wicket hauls, and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111, leaving themselves needing 134 to win. None of Somerset's top four batsmen reached 20 runs, but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett, accompanied by 32 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> seven, Farrant Reed, helped Somerset achieve a five-wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|The Reims council also {{condemned}} {{and ordered}} the arrest of Éon de l'Étoile, a Breton heretic. He was eventually tortured into confession and imprisoned {{until his death in}} 1150. Further decrees condemned the Anacletans, supporters of an earlier antipope, who had previously been condemned in 1136. Further side business was the settling of a dispute between two Norman abbots– Eustachius of Jumieges Abbey and Robert of the Abbey of St. Vincent, Le Mans, which was handed to two cardinals to decide. The two prelates reached a decision on 5 April. Other disputes, including ones between abbots, were also handled at the council, although not necessarily during the council deliberations. Also included in the council's business was the confirmation of the excommunication of the Bishop of Dol and the Bishop of Brieux. Although it was reported that the Bishop of Orleans and the Bishop of Troyes were deposed by the council, this is erroneous, and probably stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of ecclesiastics who were suspended for non-attendance.|$|E
