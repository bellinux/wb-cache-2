40|$|Abstract- The {{interactions}} between input/output in multivariable processes represent {{a major challenge}} {{in the design of}} decentralized controllers. In this paper, a simple method for the design of decentralized PID controller is proposed. It consists to combine the conventional PID controller with the static decoupler approach. For each single loop, the individual controller is independently designed by applying the internal model control (IMC) tuning rules. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the PID controller with and without decoupling is implemented on an aerothermic process. It is a pilot scale heating and ventilation system equipped with a <b>heater</b> <b>grid</b> and a centrifugal blower, fully connected through the Humusoft MF 624 data acquisition system for real time control.

40|$|This paper investigates State Space Model Predictive Control (SSMPC) of an aerothermic process. It is a {{pilot scale}} heating and {{ventilation}} system {{equipped with a}} <b>heater</b> <b>grid</b> and a centrifugal blower, fully connected through a data acquisition system for real time control. The interaction between the process variables is shown to be challenging for single variable controllers, therefore multi-variable control is worth considering. A multi-variable state space model is obtained from on-line experimental data. The controller design is translated into a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, in which a cost function subject to actuators linear inequality constraints is minimized. The outcome of the experimental results is that the main control objectives, such as set-point tracking and perturbations rejection under actuators constraints, are well achieved for both controlled variables simultaneously...|$|E
5000|$|Short {{operational}} life. In {{the most}} common applications, valves have a working life {{of just a few}} thousand hours, much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open or shorts circuits—notably of the <b>heater</b> and <b>grid</b> structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start. Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized computing and undersea cables, specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of hours.|$|R
2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel. (Glow plugs, <b>grid</b> <b>heaters</b> and block heaters help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), or a variant of neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40 °C (104 °F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no <b>heater</b> or control <b>grid,</b> typically a single anode, and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The aerothermic {{process is}} a pilot scale heating and {{ventilation}} system equipped with a <b>heater</b> <b>grid</b> and a centrifugal blower. The interaction between its main variables is considered as challenging for mono-variable controllers. A change in the ventilator speed affects the temperature behavior which represents a factor that must be managed for energy saving and the human welfare. This paper presents an experimental comparison between a Centralized Discrete State Space Model Predictive Control (CDSSMPC) and a Decentralized PI-D (DPI-D) controller. These both techniques are designed by using respectively the Laguerres functions and the static decoupler approach. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} two methods, an implementation on an aerothermic process is performed. This pilot scale is fully connected through the Humusoft MF 624 data acquisition system for real time control. The results show satisfactory performance in closed-loop of the DPI-D controller compared to the CDSSMPC and the conventional PID ones...|$|E

The interaction between its main variables is considered as challenging for mono-variable controllers. An abrupt change in the ventilator speed might cause an undesirable disturbance in the air temperature representing a factor that must be managed to conserve energy. To annul the effect of this interaction, this paper presents an experimental comparison between three forms of the PID controller: the conventional PID controller, the PI-D controller and its decentralized version. A multi-variable continuous state space model is obtained from on-line experimental data. The outcome of the experimental results is that the main control M. Ramzi, N. Bennis, M.

40|$|A pulsed single-blow {{method has}} been {{developed}} for testing of Stirling regenerator materials performance. The method uses a tubular flow arrangement with a steady gas flow passing through a regenerator matrix sample that packs the flow channel for a short distance. A wire <b>grid</b> <b>heater</b> spanning the gas flow channel is used to heat a plug of gas by approximately 2 K for approximately 350 ms. Foil thermocouples monitor the gas temperature entering and leaving the sample. Data analysis based on a 1 D incompressible-flow thermal model allows the extraction of Stanton number. A figure of merit involving heat transfer and pressure drop is used to present results for steel screens and steel felt. The observations show a lower figure of merit for the materials tested than is expected based on correlations obtained by other methods...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and <b>grid</b> <b>heaters</b> to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|R
