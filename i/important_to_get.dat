25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E
25|$|Studying bilingual {{acquisition}} {{is important}} because it may have real effects on academic performances for bilingual children in school. Research has shown that vocabulary size is an indicator of academic performance and literacy. As we know, different contexts can cause differences in vocabulary in each language. Despite these differences, have suggested that bilingual children are not necessarily disadvantaged in academic performance or academic spoken language because they have a good grasp on the language used for their academics. Regardless, home vocabulary is still relevant to academic life, and it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a better balance in vocabulary acquisition to be able to effectively communicate in both languages.|$|E

25|$|There {{will usually}} be an {{estimate}} of what price the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction it is considered <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at least a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, the auctioneer must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted {{by one of the}} bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there will indeed be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to {{the increase in the number}} of bidders attracted by the low SOB.|$|E
25|$|With the {{disappearance}} of Tommy it was considered <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Murnane to testify. His whereabouts could not be discovered and Wood assigned Inspector Condon and Detective Manning to find him. In March 1927 a tip was received and Murnane was subpoenaed to appear. Wood instructed Nairn {{that he could not}} speak to Murnane before he testified, an instruction Nairn ignored when he intercepted him {{on the way to the}} court and briefed him while Wood waited. When Murnane testified, he confirmed the main points of the evidence of the white participants but differed on two points. Jolly had said that Murnane had taken part in a raid on a large encampment, Murnane said that he had not been on that raid and that Jolly was mistaken. The other point of difference was cited by Wood; Regan's patrol (and Murnane) had originally stated they first joined St Jack's patrol north of Nulla Nulla while St Jack and Overheu said they met at the homestead (where they met had an important bearing on the alleged killings by St Jack and Overheu before Regan's party joined them). Testifying before the commission, with the exception of Murnane who repeated his earlier statement, all the white members of the patrol now repeated St Jacks version. An angry Wood concluded this was due to Nairn only having 15 minutes to speak to Murnane before he testified and added him to the list of witnesses he believed were prepared to lie to the commission.|$|E

According to Eno, the record uniquely blends funk and punk rock or new wave music. None of the compositions include chord changes and instead rely {{on the use of}} different harmonics and notes. [...] "Spidery riffs" [...] and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively throughout the album. The first side contains the more rhythmic songs recorded—"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)", [...] "Crosseyed and Painless", and [...] "The Great Curve"—which include long instrumental interludes. The last-named track contains extended synthesiser-treated guitar solos from Adrian Belew.|$|E

He chose to continue with it, deciding that {{it would be interesting to}} give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers [...] "know and love [...] going through a really hard time." [...] In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way. Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: [...] "Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and I wanted to see it fresh through her eyes". She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline, and found it particularly <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign.|$|E

30|$|Parents were {{originally}} asked to {{agree or disagree}} with the following: “If my child maintains good oral health, s/he will {{have a better chance of}} getting into college and having a successful career.” Parents found this question confusing because they did not view oral health as <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> into college. They saw that process as impersonal, namely relying on data, such as the grade point average, SAT/ACT scores and recommendation letters, and not the direct contact with the admissions decision-makers. By contrast, parents regarded a career as an interpersonal process involving direct interaction where oral health plays a more important role. As a result, we decided to relate oral health to chance of success in life.|$|R
30|$|Social network {{studies have}} found that {{individuals}} are influenced by many actors in the social system or network. For example, Coleman et al. (1957) and Menzel and Katz (1955) found cohesive groups exhibit greater behavioral conformity, whereas Burt (1987) found that an individual’s decision-making process is influenced by those having structurally similar positions. Conversely, Granovetter (1983) showed that weaker social ties are more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> information, whereas Valente (1996) argued individuals follow others with whom he or she has direct and strong social relations. Therefore, individual social referents in respect of acquiring information have yet to be clearly defined. Based on the social network theory, we examine three social network groups to seek information and process activities.|$|R
