30|$|In {{both the}} {{competition}} and cooperation cases, the cost-adjusted service quality is positively associated with the <b>market</b> share <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2. This is also applicable to <b>market</b> 3 <b>in</b> the cooperation case but not the competition case, because the HSR service is not provided <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3. Finally, <b>in</b> the cooperation case, if the variable cost c_ 2,r< c_ 2,a, then the optimal price of HSR is {{less than that of}} the air sector <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2. The air–rail itinerary <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3 is preferable to air only, if c_ 3,ar< c_ 3,a. Furthermore, the difference in the optimal price between air and rail <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 and air and air–rail <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3 is equal to the difference in the variable cost between the two sectors.|$|R
30|$|From this proposition, {{the fixed}} {{cost of the}} air–rail mode and non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 play an {{important}} role in determining the effectiveness of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 is high, the effect of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market depends on the welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3, because cooperation does not impact the welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 by Proposition  4.6. Thus, in this case, the fixed cost of the air–rail mode affects the social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 is relatively low, we need to consider the balance between the decrease in social welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 and the increase in social welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3. Since the amount of social welfare <b>in</b> each <b>market</b> depends largely on the number of potential customers, the social welfare will be increased by cooperation if the amount of social welfare <b>in</b> the connecting <b>market</b> is relatively large. We will demonstrate this with numerical examples.|$|R

5|$|A choice edible species, Boletus aereus {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, {{and is considered}} by many to be gastronomically superior to Boletus edulis. In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} <b>in</b> <b>markets</b> and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E
