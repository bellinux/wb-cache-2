Ninety-nine {{individuals}} with stools positive for Blastocystis hominis but negative for other parasites were identified from medical records of healthy adults {{who had received}} a physical examination at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from November 2000 to October 2002. The medical records of these 99 positive cases and 193 randomly selected controls, matched for age, sex, and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination,</b> were retrospectively reviewed. The pathogenicity of B. hominis could not be demonstrated {{due to a lack}} of association with the development of gastrointestinal symptoms or pathologic findings on endoscopic examination. Multivariate analyses revealed that chronic hepatitis B infection was a predisposing condition to the acquisition of B. hominis (odd ratio 2. 848, 95 % confidence interval 1. 299 – 6. 242, P 0. 009), and concentration of urate was significantly lower in B. hominis-positive individuals (mean ± SD 361. 64 ± 87. 44 versus 392. 57 ± 93. 38 mol/L; P 0. 009).

30|$|All {{statistical}} {{analysis was performed}} using SAS software (version 9.2). We censored observational date on September 1, 2012. Thus, the years of exposure were computed from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> (CBE or 2 imaging screening) to the date of diagnosis or death, or the date of end. The sensitivity of a certain screening method was defined as the number of subjects correctly classified as breast cancers by this method divided by the number of all malignant cases diagnosed, and specificity was the ratio of true negatives by the method to all negatives. Positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated as the number of true positive divided {{by the total number of}} subjects who tested positive, and negative predictive value (NPV) referred to the proportion of subjects with a negative test result who were correctly diagnosed. χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the clinicopathological characteristics between screened and interval cancers, and diagnostic performance between different screening methods. Cox model was used to compute the hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidential interval (CI) of risk factors of breast cancer.

40|$|Background: Sedentary {{behavior}} {{has emerged as}} a novel health risk factor independent of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Previous studies have shown self-reported sedentary time to be associated with mortality; however, no studies have investigated the effect of objectively measured sedentary time on mortality independent of MVPA. The objective our {{study was to examine the}} association between objectively measured sedentary time and all-cause mortality. Methods: 7 -day accelerometry data of 1906 participants aged 50 and over from the U. S. nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 – 2004 were analyzed. All-cause mortality was assessed from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> through December 31, 2006. Results: Over an average follow-up of 2. 8 years, there were 145 deaths reported.

Design and Setting:  Registry data from a sexual assault forensic nurse examiners program. Participants:  Based on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination,</b> records from women of age 50 years or older (n= 40) were matched to two other participants: a premenopausal group younger than 40 years and a perimenopausal group of 40 to 49 years. The final sample consisted of 120 subjects. Main Outcome Measures:  Number, type, and location of injuries. Results:  A series of exact conditional logistic regression analyses indicated no significant association between age and genital, nongenital, or head injury. A significant association between race (Black versus White) and genital injury (adjusted odds ratio = 4. 30, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 09 - 25. 98, p=. 03) indicated that Whites were {{more than four times}} as likely as Blacks to have genital injury. Conclusion:  Although the primary hypothesis was not supported, the role of racial/ethnic differences and their association with the observance of injury need further exploration to {{determine whether}} the standard forensic examination is appropriate for all women. Health disparities may exist if women of color are less likely than others to have genital injuries identified and treated.

40|$|Background. Anemia in {{pregnancy}} {{is common in}} Tanzania, but many areas have not been investigated. This study describes prevalence and determinants of anemia among rural preg-nant women living at 1300 – 2200 meters above sea level in Northern Tanzania. Methods. Three thousand eight hundred and thirty-six pregnant women from two rural divi-sions of Mbulu and Hanang districts attending antenatal clinic between January 1995 and March 1996 were assessed in a cross-sectional study. Blood samples were examined for hemo-globin concentration (Hb) and thick blood slide (BS) for malaria. Information on <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination,</b> village, age, ethnic and religious affiliation, gestational age, and parity was recorded. Altitude was derived from official maps. Main outcome measures were mean Hb level and risk of anemia defined as a Hb of less than 9. 0 g/dl. Results. Hb levels ranged from 4. 5 to 18. 1 g/dl, and mean was 12. 1 g/dl. Twenty-three per cent had a Hb of less than 11 g/dl, 4. 6 % less than 9 g/dl and 0. 5 % less than 7 g/dl; standardized to sea level 36. 1 %, 8. 8 %, and 1. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) {{is a human}} {{prion disease}} found in four forms: sporadic, familial, {{iatrogenic}} and variant. Clinical and radiological presenting features of {{the various forms of}} prion disease are well documented, but the natural history is less well described. Knowledge of the imaging appearances in human prion diseases is increasing and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been developec;l to analyse progression of cerebral atrophy. As part of a clinical trial, patients with different types of CJD were assessed regularly using a standardised videoed clinical examination (including cognitive and motor tests) and MRI including a volumetric sequence. Each clinical video was scored by an independent neurologist blinded to the patients' diagnosis, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> and arm of trial. The corresponding volumetric MRI was also analysed blindly to measure brain volume, the brain boundary shift integral (a more accurate means of assessing volume change between scans) and a visual representation of the sites of atrophy.. Rates of brain atrophy were correlated with baseline clinical scores and clinical decline in scores. Regional analysis of cerebellar volume was performed and the changes in the different types of human prion disease were compared. Greater understanding of disease course and rates of brain atrophy will aid clinicians in diagnosis and prognosis and provide the basis for surrogate markers of disease progression. Use of the most appropriate markers will optimise measurement of therapeutic outcomes in clinical trials in human prion disease. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans are indispensable {{in modern}} medicine; however, the spectacular rise in global use coupled with relatively {{high doses of}} ionizing radiation per examination have raised radiation protection concerns. Children are of particular concern {{because they are more}} sensitive to radiation-induced cancer compared with adults and have a long lifespan to express harmful effects which may offset clinical benefits of performing a scan. This paper describes the design and methodology of a nationwide study, the Dutch Pediatric CT Study, regarding risk of leukemia and brain tumors in children after radiation exposure from CT scans. It is a retrospective record-linkage cohort study with an expected number of 100, 000 children who received at least one electronically archived CT scan covering the calendar period since the introduction of digital archiving until 2012.

Due to the large amount of data spanning multiple institutions, this database may have applications in providing a more general and inclusive overview of healthcare. Here, we investigate the use of administrative data for analyses of long-term survival in cancer patients. We analyzed postoperative survival in 7, 064 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer admitted to 102 hospitals between April 2008 and March 2013 using DPC data. Survival was defined at the last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> or discharge within the study period, and the event was mortality during the same period. Overall {{survival rates}} for different cancer stages were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, survival rates of cancer patients at clinical stage IA were compared between low- and high-volume hospitals using the Log-rank test. Postoperative 5 -year survival for patients at stage IA was 85.8 % (95 % CI[*]=[*] 78.6 %– 93.0 %). High-volume hospitals had higher survival rates than hospitals with lower volume. Our findings using large-scale administrative data were similar to previous clinical registry reports, showing potential applications as a new method in analyzing up-to-date healthcare information.|$|E

SETTING [...] Outpatient clinics of the departments of dermatology of the university central hospitals in Helsinki, Oulu, and Tampere from September 1987 to April 1989. SUBJECTS [...] 144 Patients with psoriasis and 285 unmatched controls with other skin diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Results of clinical examination and self administered questionnaire assessing lifestyle and alcohol intake during two specified periods [...] namely, 12 months before the onset of skin disease and 12 months before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination.</b> RESULTS [...] Recalled mean alcohol intake before the onset of skin diseases was 42. 9 g/day among the patients with psoriasis and 21. 0 g/day among the controls. In logistic regression analysis psoriasis was associated with alcohol intake but not with coffee consumption, smoking, age, marital state, or social group. The odds ratio for psoriasis at an alcohol intake of 100 g/day compared with no intake was 2. 2 (95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 3. 9). The controls decreased their alcohol intake after the onset of the disease but the group with psoriasis did not. Analysis of serum enzyme values showed that gamma-glutamyltransferase activity was significantly correlated with alcohol intake (r = 0. 35), the mean activity being 75. 0 U/l among patients with psoriasis and 41. 9 U/l among controls.

This study aimed to assess the effect of Citrus reticulata peel (CRP) {{as an adjunct to}} low-volume PEG for colonic preparation. Methods: A total of 1092 health examination examinees received colonoscopy during the study period. After excluding those who refused to participate {{and those who did not}} meet our criteria, 212 examinees were enrolled into this study. They were divided into the PEG group and the PEG + CRP group according to their <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination.</b> All examinees received 2 L of PEG-ELS one day before colonoscopy. The PEG + CRP group also received additional CRP in the form of a “buccal tablet” between drinks. Tolerance and adverse events were assessed by questionnaire, while the quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy was scored by an endoscopist. Results: There were 107 examinees in the PEG group and 105 examinees in the PEG + CRP group. The demographic characteristics of the examinees were comparable between these two groups. Examinees in the PEG + CRP group had a trend of better colonic visibility than those in the PEG group (p =  0. 056). Moreover, examinees in the PEG + CRP group had higher rate of acceptable taste (p =  0. 015) and lower rate of difficulty swallowing (p =  0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity has, in {{a number}} of studies, been found to {{correlate}} to disability and mortality, primarily due to diseases of the circulatory and musculoskeletal systems. In addition, an excess mortality among underweight subjects has been observed in previous studies. METHODS: Five complete birth-year cohorts (1926 - 1930) of male residents in Malmo (n = 7697) were invited to the survey at the Department of Preventive Medicine, Malmo General Hospital, and 5926 (77 %) attended with complete data. Each subject was followed from inclusion, defined by the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination,</b> {{until the end of the}} calendar year when he turned 58, a total study period of approximately 11 years. Data on about 300 questionnaire items and laboratory tests were determined at the health survey visit. Nationwide Swedish data registers were used for surveillance. RESULTS: Of the participants, 4. 7 % were underweight, 37. 7 % overweight, 7. 3 % obese and 50. 3 % normal weight; 849 (14. 3 %) had been granted disability pension at the end of follow-up, 717 after screening. After adjustment for smoking there was a J-shaped relation between body mass index (BMI) and incidence of disability pension, the relative risk (with the normal group as reference) among underweight men being 1. 9. For the overweight subjects it was 1. 3 and for the obese 2. 8, all differences were significant. Disease of the musculoskeletal and circulatory systems and mental disorders accounted for 67. 2 % of all main diagnoses resulting in disability pensions during follow-up. A total of 377 (6. 4 %) men died during follow-up. Diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms, injury/poisoning and diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 91. 8 % of the deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Both underweight, overweight and obesity were related to risk of disability pension, with a J-shaped risk relationship...|$|E

30|$|The {{strength}} {{of this study is}} that it provides the first suggestion that BSI at diagnosis of bone metastasis is predictive for SRE. A limitation {{of this study is that}} treatment for metastatic breast cancer was heterogeneous because the study is retrospective. Brain metastasis had a trend as a prognostic factor for OS by the multivariate analysis, this is because only three patients were with brain metastases; it must be due to the weakness of the small number of this subgroup. There was also some variation in the length of time between the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis of metastasis and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> bone scan <b>examination.</b> As a next step, a prospective study to validate the clinical significance of BSI is needed.|$|R
