5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' <b>development</b> <b>manager,</b> Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E

40|$|National Governing Bodies in Sport in the United Kingdom {{increasingly}} {{implement the}} Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> Scheme {{in the quest}} to promote effective leadership within their organisations. Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> need professional leadership development. However, much {{of what has been}} done in this regard falls drastically short. Leadership development has been too vague, outdated and theoretical. It has rarely been tied to an organisation’s immediate needs, nor has it adequately prepared leaders for the challenges of the future. An approach to leadership development programmes that combines theoretical concepts with opportunities to apply observable behaviours is required. The 21 st century demands a new kind of leader with relevant skills. Action learning is effective in developing leaders because it is adaptable and flexible. In this investigation, 58 Regional Development Officers were asked to rate the leadership styles of Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> on the Leadership Style Inventory (LSI). In turn, 18 Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> were asked to report on the same questionnaire their own leadership styles. According to Regional Development Officers, the two leadership styles mostly displayed by Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> (according to behavioural rating) are the coaching and democratic styles. Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Managers</b> deemed the affiliative and democratic styles to be the mostly used. The findings of this study, together with relevant literature, are used to propose a Leadership Styles Competency Framework for Governing Bodies in Sport. [URL]...|$|R
