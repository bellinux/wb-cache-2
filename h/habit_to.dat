5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E

25|$|It was Liszt's <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> declare all {{students}} {{who took part in}} his lessons as his private students. As consequence, almost none of them paid any fees to the Academy. A ministerial order of 13 February 1884 decreed that all those who took part in Liszt's lessons had to pay an annual charge of 30 Gulden. In fact, the Academy was in any case a net gainer, since Liszt donated it revenue from his charity concerts.|$|E
25|$|The work {{appeared}} anonymously in 1704. It was Swift's <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> publish anonymously {{throughout his}} career, partially {{as a way}} of protecting his career, and partially his person. As a struggling churchman, Swift needed the support of nobles to gain a living. Additionally, nobles were still responsible for Church affairs in the House of Lords, so his political effectiveness in church affairs depended upon the lords. Swift needed to be at some distance from the sometimes bawdy and scatological work that he wrote.|$|E

Tied to an {{obsolete}} system, and unable, from <b>habit,</b> <b>to</b> realize the changed conditions of warfare, he failed, but his enemies held him in the highest respect as a brave, skilful, and chivalrous opponent. It was he who, at Altenkirchen, cared for the dying Marceau (1796), and the white uniforms of Kray and his staff mingled with the blue of the French in the funeral procession of the young general of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|Sparkling {{wines are}} served in {{particular}} glasses {{such as the}} flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional tasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to {{the nose of the}} taster and its height allows appreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its too flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam and the gas and aromas escape too fast. According to legend, this type of glass was developed based on the shape of the Breast of the Marquise de Pompadour. The coupe dates from a time when the wines were mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> consume drier sparkling wines, the flute has taken the place of the coupe. The coupe is also used in mixtures which have an olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities.|$|E
25|$|The {{collaboration}} with socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta was praised {{by both sides}} {{at the start of}} the mandate, but deteriorated thereafter once with foreign visits of the Head of the Executive, without informing the President, but especially with the criminal prosecution of Victor Ponta for 22 alleged corruption charges, prompting Iohannis to demand his resignation from the head of the Government. Relations with Parliament went similarly. Iohannis criticized the Parliament for defending MPs by rejecting the requests of the National Anticorruption Directorate for lifting their immunity, as in the case of PSD senator Dan Șova or Prime Minister Victor Ponta. Regarding the judicial system, Klaus Iohannis pleads for a sustained fight against corruption. Likewise, Iohannis expressed dissatisfaction with attempted amendments to the Penal Code. Since coming into office, President Klaus Iohannis has made a <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> hold consultations with parliamentary parties. The first round of consultations took place on 12 January, the purpose of these discussions being a political agreement that would ensure, by 2017, a minimum threshold of 2% of GDP for the Ministry of Defence, agreement signed by all parties. The second round of consultations focused on the legislative priorities of the parliamentary session: voting in diaspora, financing electoral campaigns and parties and lifting parliamentary immunity. Because the Parliament has not implemented the commitments made on 28 January, Iohannis has organised another series of consultations on the state of electoral laws, but also on rejection of Justice requests for approval of arrest or prosecution of MPs. The topics of other meetings between the president and parties aimed the Big Brother law package and the national defense strategy.|$|E

500|$|Any given {{organisation}} {{cannot be}} easily {{reduced to a}} particular form of power. For instance, the police and army are quite obviously instruments of force and coercion, {{but it would be}} facile to say that they have power simply because of their ability to physically coerce. Rather, the police are regarded as instruments of a legitimate institution by some population, and the organisation depends upon propaganda and <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> maintain popular deference to their authority. Similarly, economic organisations operate by the use of conditioning, in the form of money; but the strength of an economy arguably depends in large part on the functional operation of law enforcement which makes commerce possible, by the regulation of peace and property rights.

500|$|The first {{reference}} to the Eighth Symphony in Sibelius's diary is an undated entry from September 1926: “I offered to create something for America.” However, some of the initial ideas for the new symphony were almost certainly set down earlier, since it was Sibelius's compositional <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> set aside themes and motifs for use in later projects. Thus, one of the extant sketches for his Seventh Symphony, on which he was engaged in 1923–24, contains a ringed motif marked [...] "VIII". By the autumn of 1927 Sibelius was able to inform the New York Times music critic Olin Downes—one of his greatest admirers—that he had set down two movements of the Eighth on paper and had composed the rest in his head.|$|E
500|$|Located {{at the end}} of {{pleasure}} gardens called Beckford's Ride which ran from his house in Lansdown Crescent all the way north to the tower at the top of Lansdown Hill, Beckford used the monument as both a library and a retreat. He also made it his <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> ride up to the tower to view the progress of gardens and works then walk back down to Lansdown Crescent for breakfast. From the top of the tower, with a strong spyglass, Beckford could make out shipping in the Bristol Channel. Beckford wished that he had built the tower forty feet higher and admitted: [...] "such as it is, it is a famous landmark for drunken farmers on their way home from market".|$|E
500|$|By [...] "traditional power", Russell has in {{mind the}} ways in which people will appeal to the force of <b>habit</b> <b>to</b> justify a {{political}} regime. It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, as far as they could, to tradition, and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system."
