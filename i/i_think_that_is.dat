And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> something one just cannot know.|$|E

Heller commented, [...] "Romans didn't have our body shame and fear of sexuality. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of the modern fascination with that world.

500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!'

Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a mistake.
