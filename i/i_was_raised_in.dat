25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
500|$|The title track's opening lyric [...] "Born into Nixon, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> hell" [...] {{references}} Armstrong's birth year of 1972, while [...] "We are {{the class}} of '13" [...] references {{the fact that his}} eldest son, Joseph, will graduate from high school in 2013. Dirnt has expressed his belief that [...] "Last of the American Girls" [...] was written about Armstrong's wife Adrienne, who he claimed is steadfast in her beliefs and assertively defends them. Armstrong has cited his [...] "disconnected" [...] childhood—he was raised by his five older siblings after their father's death, while their mother worked graveyard shifts as a waitress—as the roots of the discontent expressed on 21st Century Breakdown. [...] "East Jesus Nowhere" [...] rebukes fundamentalist religion and was written after Armstrong attended a church service where a friend's baby was baptized.|$|E

And the first books, which I read, were in Russian. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> {{the atmosphere of the}} Russian classical theatre school. The art, built on the system of Stanislavsky – that's the most realistic art. And the modern cinema stands on the same principle. A Russian person wants to find the truth. This is the base of the Russian culture. I never forget it, especially since I have Russian roots". When asked if she still feels Russian, after having left Russia at a young age, Milla replied, [...] "Definitely. I still speak Russian. I speak it with my daughter. I read her Russian stories and poems. My roots are very important — they make me who I am".|$|E

I {{read a lot}} of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> a place where pioneer women were very strong still. They'd shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn't really until I've gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} world's most {{prominent}} atheists. [...] In a 1960 interview, he was asked about his attitude toward religion, and his response has become one of his most celebrated quotes: [...] "I'm still an atheist, thank God." [...] But his entire answer to the question was somewhat more nuanced: [...] "I have no attitude. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> it. I could answer [...] "I'm still an atheist, thank God." [...] I believe we must seek God within man himself. This is a very simple attitude." [...] Critics have pointed out that Buñuel's atheism was closely connected to his surrealism, in that he considered chance and mystery, and not providence, to be at the heart of all reality.|$|E
