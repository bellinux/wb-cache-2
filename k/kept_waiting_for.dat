5|$|Sentiments {{changed with}} the XYZ Affair. Adams {{appointed}} a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France. The commission consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was {{to make up for}} offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the group}} went on hiatus, {{during which time}} Anselmo worked on side projects, such as Superjoint Ritual and Down. This caused more {{friction}} within the band, as the Abbott brothers <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Anselmo to become available {{to work with them}} again. The frustration with Anselmo led to their decision to disband Pantera in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Shotgun starts {{are mainly}} used for amateur tournament play. In this variant, {{each of the}} groups playing starts their game on a {{different}} hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round {{at roughly the same}} time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation to stroke or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.|$|E

This diplomatic scandal {{became known as the}} XYZ Affair, inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Marshall arrived in New York on June 17. His handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular with the American public. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, enacted by the Federalists in response to the crisis.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October, Gough {{had issued}} a Memorandum on Attacks which {{summarized}} {{the lessons of}} the battle. Gough pointed out that maintaining the momentum of an attack required that succeeding waves and reserves should not be <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> opportunities to intervene in the battle, because communication delays left them with no time to act. Brigadiers should reorganize the troops holding successive objectives, since these troops became reserves once the advance had moved on. Brigadiers should move with the advance and divisional commanders should create reserves by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, {{to keep in touch with}} events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were far easier to maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also had the benefit of air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, so as to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to overseeing {{the release of}} the Concert for Bangladesh documentary film prevented him from being able to start on the follow-up to his All Things Must Pass triple album until midway through 1972. Another delay was caused by producer Phil Spector's unreliability, as Harrison waited for him to turn up {{for the start of the}} sessions. Author Bruce Spizer writes that [...] "the eccentric producer's erratic attendance caused George to realize the project would never get done if he <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Spector", and by October that year, Harrison had decided to produce the album alone.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sidney Grier grunted. He was {{not used}} to being <b>kept</b> <b>waiting,</b> even <b>for</b> a second. Tavernake ushered him into the {{retiring}} room, and the other two musicians who were there stared at him as at a god.|$|R

500|$|In February 1964, {{the tribal}} {{council of the}} Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation {{requested}} a meeting with Maine's governor and attorney general to discuss a land dispute related to construction by non-Indians on lands claimed by the tribe. The Passamaquoddy representatives were <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> 5 hours after their scheduled meeting time with the governor, {{and the attorney general}} [...] "smiled and wished them well if they ever took their claim to court." [...] Soon after the meeting, pursuant to a vote of the Passamaquoddy tribal council, 75 members protested against the construction project along Route 1, resulting in 10 arrests. Charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing, they hired attorney Don Gellers to defend them. While these charges were still pending, Gellers began to prepare a land claim on behalf of the tribe.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} an 8.0/10 rating, IGN's Ramsey Isler thought the episode wasn't [...] "as hard-hitting {{as most of}} the {{previous}} 'mythology' episodes, but it still leaves a good impression". Isler enjoyed the [...] "tense and intriguing" [...] opening and ending of the episode, but <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> more to happen in the middle. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall called the opening [...] "one {{of the best in the}} entire series" [...] and [...] "certainly the best television I've seen this year." [...] In addition, Stegall praised Olivia's dream sequence and subsequent accusation of Walter, the inclusion of Massive Dynamic as allies, Broyles' role as [...] "support" [...] rather than [...] "the usual role of Plot Obstacle," [...] and the science behind the episode ("The very fact that we can have two different yet legitimate quantum physics explanations on a television drama is, in itself, cause for applause."). She concluded her review by noting Anna Torv has made [...] "the most progress" [...] in her performance, evolving from [...] "downright wooden in the first year" [...] to [...] "carrying the role with grace and strength." [...] Website blogger io9 listed [...] "Jacksonville" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the matchup with Chrome, but he just didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that no one knew what exactly happened, [...] "We don't know if he just wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when he stretched out the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury went down, and he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{treatment}} of contestants at the audition stage was heavily criticised by the Daily Mail, which described applicants being <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> over 10 hours with no food or drink provided, with no certainty of {{being allowed to}} perform {{more than a few}} seconds of their act. It also detailed how staff intentionally built up the hopes of low-quality performers in order to maximise the dramatic effect of the judges' put-downs, and the fine points of the contracts performers must sign, which gives the show infinite freedom to [...] "modify" [...] the footage for their own purposes, and to use the footage indefinitely for whatever purpose they choose.|$|E
2500|$|Operations {{north of}} the Ancre waited on the {{completion}} of the capture of the ridge north of Courcelette and Thiepval, by the Canadian Corps and II Corps. The remainder of Stuff and [...] redoubts were to be captured and the front line was to be advanced to Regina Trench/Stuff Trench (...) on the reverse slope of the ridge, the attack being set for 1 October. On 5 October Gough issued a Memorandum on Attacks which summarized the lessons of the battle.

2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I <b>kept</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> some other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t mean this is a bad song, just maybe an underwhelming one." ...|$|E
