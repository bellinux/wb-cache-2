Yet, at the graduate level, especially with courses offered in an online modality, <b>experiential</b> service <b>learning</b> {{in the form of}} client project assignments presents unique challenges. However, with an increased emphasis on practical application across the business curricula and growth in distance learning, client projects can provide opportunities for adult learners to hone their skills and encourage teamwork using new collaborative technology.

25|$|A nursing {{course is}} a 50/50 split of {{learning}} in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and are 4,600 hours in length, which is split 50%/50% between theory and clinical placements as set out as a requirement of the NMC. Graduate courses are provided and are two years in length. Graduate courses often require prior learning and relevant healthcare experience; this {{can be referred to}} as APEL (Accreditation of Prior and <b>Experiential</b> <b>Learning).</b>|$|E
25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on <b>experiential</b> <b>{{learning}},</b> but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E
25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good memory recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as <b>experiential</b> <b>learning</b> or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} livelihood benefits {{derived by}} rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources.

Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalised groups. Lessons for replication emphasise <b>experiential</b> <b>learning,</b> establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.|$|E

The program principally exposes at-risk children and their teachers to real-world applications of math and science; it includes <b>experiential</b> <b>learning,</b> simulations, and experiments in aviation and space-related fields. The program also addresses drug use prevention, health, self esteem and life skills within a math-and science-based program. Founded in 1995 by SSgt Elaine Montgomery, the program celebrates its 15th anniversary in May, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapies are {{categorized}} {{in several}} different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a medical model and those based on a humanistic model. In the medical model the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the DSM-IV, {{the diagnostic and statistical}} manual of mental disorders in the United States, is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to <b>experiential</b> <b>learning</b> and help build the client's confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. The therapist may see themselves as a facilitator/helper.|$|E
