2500|$|A year later, Aroch {{contacted}} both again, suggesting {{they make}} a television series about the religious singles scene in Jerusalem, the so-called [...] "Katamon swamp" [...] or [...] "marsh". A real sociological phenomenon, the [...] "swamp" [...] is a large concentration of middle-class Religious Zionist {{men and women who}} remain unmarried at a relatively advanced age, a trend causing much strain in their society. Divon and Shapiro created a basic outline for a show, and conceived of the five main characters. They planned to name the series, Kovshei Katamon ("Conquerors of Katamon"), which is the name of one of the area's main streets and a reference to the neighborhood's [...] "conquest" [...] by members of the [...] "swamp". The studios refused to accept the title. On 20 July 2006, Ma'ariv first reported about contacts between Aroch and the television companies of Keshet and Yes, concerning the <b>future</b> <b>purchase</b> of the series, labeled under the working title Sex v'ha'Ir haQdosha ("Sex and the Holy City"). It was reported that due to the high production costs expected, the companies considered broadcasting it first on satellite and later on terrestrial television, to ensure maximal revenues.|$|E
6000|$|I am less {{convinced}} that my society makes amends to Mordecai for your [...] absence, but another substitute occasionally {{comes in the}} form of [...] Jacob Cohen. It is worth while to catch our prophet's expression when [...] he has that remarkable type of young Israel on his knee, and pours [...] forth some Semitic inspiration with a sublime look of melancholy [...] patience and devoutness. Sometimes it occurs to Jacob that Hebrew will [...] be more edifying to him if he stops his ears with his palms, and [...] imitates the venerable sounds as heard through that muffled medium. [...] When Mordecai gently draws down the little fists and holds them fast, [...] Jacob's features all take on an extraordinary activity, very much as [...] if he was walking through a menagerie and trying to imitate every [...] animal in turn, succeeding best with the owl and the peccary. But I [...] dare say you have seen something of this. He treats me with the [...] easiest familiarity, and seems in general to look at me as a second-hand [...] Christian commodity, likely to come down in price; remarking on [...] my disadvantages with a frankness which seems to imply some thoughts [...] of <b>future</b> <b>purchase.</b> It is pretty, though, to see the change in him if [...] Mirah happens to come in. He turns child suddenly--his age usually [...] strikes one as being like the Israelitish garments in the desert, [...] perhaps near forty, yet with an air of recent production. But, with [...] Mirah, he reminds me of the dogs that have been brought up by women, [...] and remain manageable by them only. Still, the dog is fond of Mordecai [...] too, and brings sugar-plums to share with him, filling his own mouth [...] to rather an embarrassing extent, and watching how Mordecai deals with [...] a smaller supply. Judging from this modern Jacob at the age of six, my [...] astonishment is that his race has not bought us all up long ago, and [...] pocketed our feebler generations in the form of stock and scrip, as so [...] much slave property. There is one Jewess I should not mind being slave [...] to. But I wish I did not imagine that Mirah gets a little sadder, and [...] tries all the while to hide it. It is natural enough, of course, while [...] she has to watch the slow death of this brother, whom she has taken to [...] worshipping with such looks of loving devoutness that I am ready to [...] wish myself in his place.|$|E

40|$|We use {{the results}} of three {{large-scale}} field experiments to investigate how the depth of a current price promotion affects <b>future</b> <b>purchasing</b> of first-time and established customers. While most previous {{studies have focused on}} packaged goods sold in grocery stores, we consider durable goods sold through a direct mail catalog. The findings reveal different effects for first-time and established customers. Deeper price discounts in the current period <b>future</b> <b>purchases</b> by first-time customers (a positive long-run effect) but <b>future</b> <b>purchases</b> by established customers (a negative long-run effect). Overall, the results show evidence of several long-run effects: forward buying, selection, customer learning, and increased deal sensitivity. Short-run metrics that ignore these effects overstate the overall change in demand for established customers. The implication is that if prices are set based on short-run elasticity, then they will be too low. Among first-time customers, the short-run metrics underestimate the total increase in demand. If prices are set based on short-run elasticity, then they will be too high. price promotions, pricing, long-term effects, forward buying, purchase acceleration, deal sensitivity, catalogs...|$|R
