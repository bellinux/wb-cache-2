40|$|The {{impregnation}} of {{leafy vegetables}} with cryoprotectants {{using a combination}} of vacuum impregnation (VI) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) has been proposed by our research group as a method of improving their freezing tolerance and consequently their general quality after thawing. In this study, we have investigated the metabolic consequences of the combination of these unit operations on spinach. The vacuum impregnated spinach leaves showed a drastic decrease in the porosity of the extracellular space. However, at maximum weight gain, randomly located air pockets remained, which may account for oxygen-consuming pathways in the cells being active after VI. The metabolic activity of the impregnated leaves showed a drastic increase that was further enhanced by the application of PEF to the <b>impregnated</b> <b>tissue.</b> Impregnating the leaves with trehalose by VI led to a significant accumulation of trehalose- 6 -phosphate (T 6 P), however, this was not further enhanced by PEF. It is suggested that the accumulation of T 6 P in the leaves may increase metabolic activity, and increase tissue resistance to abiotic stress. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A Wescor Vapor Pressure Osmometer {{measured}} the osmolality {{of a solution}} by sensing the vapor pressure above the solution in a closed chamber. The instrument sensing element comprised a precision thermocouple which {{measured the}} dew point temperature depression, {{a function of the}} water vapor pressure in the chamber. It used approximately 5 - 7 microliter samples to saturate a 0. 64 cm filter paper disc. The instrument fixed a milliosmolal digital reading and signaled test completion in 110 seconds. The instrument weighed approximately 3. 62 kilograms, was 26. 7 x 24. 1 x 10. 2 cms in size and had a range of 0 to 1999 milliosmolal. The modular solid state osmometer contained no mechanical moving parts, required no refrigerated components, sample pipetting, sample tube, and no operator attention following sample insertion. Cleaning the sample chamber pocket between tests with an acetone <b>impregnated</b> <b>tissue</b> improved repeatability of the osmometer and reduced the coefficient of variability from O. 76 % to 0. 70 % on a raw milk sample. Two hundred individual cow milk samples from 20 herds were run in February, 1974, to establish a mean freezing point in Cache Valley herds for that period. The mean and standard deviation was 280 ± 3. 0 millisomolal. Results of milk samples containing 0 to 25 % added water measured by the osmometer were compared to those obtained from an Advanced thermistor cryoscope. The coefficient of correlation was 0. 991. A collaborative study was conducted involving eight hospitals and industry laboratories. When the results of two laboratories were discarded, due to instrument maintenance problems, {{there were no significant differences}} among the laboratories in their abilities to quantitate added water.

40|$|The storage {{proteins}} {{of barley}} are both qualitatively and quantitatively important {{in determining the}} nutritional quality of the grain and its technological uses. The development of the barley endosperm was followed from anthesis to grain maturity by light and electron microscopy. The deposition of storage proteins in the sub-aleurone and starchy endosperm was studied using conventional electron microscopy. Correlated studies using thick sections of zinc iodide-osmium tetroxide <b>impregnated</b> <b>tissue</b> have illustrated the three-dimensional interrelationships of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and vacuoles during protein deposition. To provide {{a clearer understanding of}} protein deposition in the wild-type barley, protein body formation was also investigated in mutant barley lines where a reduced and modified synthesis of storage protein is associated with an altered protein body structure. Immunocytochemical localization of A, B, and C hordeins and the chymotrypsin inhibitors, CI- 1 and CI- 2, primary antibodies raised in rabbit and subsequently labelled with protein A-goId illustrated the storage protein in accumulating reserves in protein bodies of the wild-type barley, and the high-lysine mutant lines. Storage proteins were localized only in specific regions of both cytoplasmic and vacuolar protein deposits. A comparison of specimen preparation techniques including different fixation and embedding protocols indicated that for barley endosperm,tissue post-fixed with osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr resin gave superior results to those embedded in LR White or Lowicryl K 4 M resin. In situ hybridization was used to locate mRNA for CI- 1 and CI- 2 chymotrypsin inhibitors in barley endosperm using a biotinylated cDNA probe. The probe was localized at an ultra structural level by incubation with avidin-peroxidase and subsequent DAB staining of the peroxidase activity. The combined approach of thin- and thick- sectioning techniques for electron microscopy, in association with the molecular techniques of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, has {{led to the development of}} a new model to illustrate the course of protein body development in barley endosperm. This new model also explains those previously published results used to support apparently contradictory earlier schemes...|$|E
40|$|When {{microwaving}} and vacuum is combined, {{decrease of}} boiling temperature can be exploited in the histoprocessing procedures allowing a completely novel approach for <b>impregnating</b> <b>tissue</b> with paraffin. We found that, if {{the pressure is}} sufficiently low in the paraffin step, no ethyl-alcohol step {{is necessary for the}} dehydration. In that case, the fixed tissue blocks can be directly placed into the isopropanol and, after that, in the hot paraffin, in which the final dehydration of the tissue takes place. The full histoprocessing procedure can thus be shortened into two steps only, with a processing time (for 72 biopsies) of a mere 40 min. Working completely without ethyl alcohol might be of interest for countries in which ethyl alcohol is difficult or expensive to obtain. We conclude that vacuum-microwave histoprocessing allows us to omit ethyl-alcohol dehydration and to replace xylene, resulting in a two-step 'green' (ecological) method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe Golgi–Cox stain is an {{established}} method for characterising neuron cell morphology. The method highlights neurite processes of stained cells allowing {{the complexity of}} dendritic branching to be measured. New methodsConventional rapid Golgi and Golgi–Cox methods all require fresh impregnation in unfixed brain blocks. Here, we describe a modified method that gives high quality staining on brain tissue blocks perfusion-fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and post-fixed by immersion for 24 h. ResultsTissue perfused with 4 % PFA and post fixed for 24 h remained viable for the modified Golgi–Cox silver impregnation staining of mouse striatum from perfused wild type and zQ 175. It was not found necessary to <b>impregnate</b> <b>tissue</b> blocks with Golgi solutions prior to sectioning, as post-sectioned tissues yielded equally good impregnation. Impregnation for 14 days resulted in optimal visualisation of striatal neuron and dendritic morphology. Although no modifications applied to the rapid Golgi method were reliable, the modified Golgi–Cox method yielded consistently reliable high-quality staining. Comparison with existing methodsThe current method used fixed tissues to reduce damage and preserve cell morphology. The revised method {{was found to be}} fast, reliable and cost effective without the need for expensive staining kits and could be performed in any neuroscience lab with limited specialist equipment. ConclusionsThe present study introduces a robust reproducible and inexpensive staining method for identifying neuronal morphological changes in the post fixed mouse brain, and is suitable for assessing changes in cell morphology in models of neurodegeneration and in response to experimental treatment...|$|R

Two months later, these variables and the intensity of the insects attacks were quantified. In the 70 years old stand, the intensity of attacks was hardly related to the anatomical characteristics of the bark. However, for the other stand, 59 % and 83 % of the variability of the attacks at 3 and 6 meters respectively are explained by the anatomical characteristics, mainly due to the thickness of dead parenchyma and phloem of the outer bark.

With the {{invention}} of the microscope and a technique of staining developed by Camillo Golgi, it was possible to study individual neurons. This scientist started to <b>impregnate</b> nervous <b>tissue</b> with metal, as silver. The reaction consists in fixing particles of silver chromate to the neurilemma, and resulted in a stark black deposit in the soma, axon and dendrites of the neuron. Thus, it was possible to identify different types of neurons, as Golgi Cell, Golgi I and Golgi II.In 1885 there was a German medical researcher called Franz Nissl who developed another staining technique now known by Nissl staining. This technique is slightly different from Golgi staining since it stains the cell body and the endoplasmic reticulum.In 1887, a Spanish scientist called Santiago Ramon y Cajal learned the staining technique with Golgi and started his famous work of neuroanatomy. [...] With this technique he made an extensive study of several areas of the brain and in different species. He also described very precisely the purkinje cells, the chick cerebellum and the neuronal circuit of the rodent hippocampus.In 1941 Dr. Albert Coons used {{for the first time a}} revolutionary technique that uses the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in the tissues. He created an immunoflorescent technique for labelling the antibodies. [...] This technique continues to be widely used in neuroscience studies for identifying different structures. The most important neural markers used nowadays are the GFAB, Nestin, NeuroD antibodies and others. For the past years there are still creating new neural markers for immunocytochemistry or/and immunohistochemistry.In 1953 Heinrich Klüver invented a new staining technique called, Luxol Fast Blue stain or LFB, and with this technique it’s possible to detect demyelination in the central nervous system. Myelin sheath will be stained blue, but other structures will be stained as well.The next revolutionary technique was invented in 1969 by an American scientist called Joseph G. Gall.

40|$|International audienceThe main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the viscosity of four amelo-dentinal adhesives based on the same adhesion principles: the complete elimination of the dentinal smear layer using a 37 % orthophosphoric acid and the building of a hybrid layer in a single stage. The secondary aim was to study the filling time for a tubulus using 2 approaches: analytically and using finite elements. The viscosity of four amelo-dentinal adhesive systems (Vivadent's Syntac Sprint®, De Trey Dentsply's Prime & Bond 2. 1 ®, Prime & Bond NT® and Kuraray's Panavia F®) was determined using a viscometer (a StressTech ® rheometer) with a Couette rheometer-type tool mounted on it. A tubulus model was fixed: the assumption was of a cylindricalconical cavity with its lower part closed, a depth of 11 μm, and a radius of more than 1. 5 μm and less than 0. 5 μm. This allowed us to perform an analytical study on the time it took these tubuli to be filled by the adhesives according to their viscosity and the various pressures involved when they were introduced into the dentinal tissue. The Forge 2 software application allowed us to reduce the geometry of the tubuli referring to a 3 D problem to an axisymmetric 2 D configuration. Thus modelling using finite elements was also performed and the results obtained by the two approaches were compared. The results from the analytical calculation and from the modelling showed different patterns of behaviour by the four adhesives with different viscosities at 25 °C: Syntac Sprint®: 50 × 103 Pa s, Prime & Bond 2. 1 ®: 1. 1 × 103 Pa s, Prime & Bond NT ®: 1. 4 × 103 Pa s, Panavia F®: 10 Pa s. The four adhesives would fill up the dentinal tubuli very quickly indeed. At identical surface tension values, the viscosity would have an influence on the filling time for the dentinal tubuli. Clinically, given the 20 s recommended by manufacturers in order for these products to <b>impregnate</b> the dentinal <b>tissue,</b> the viscosity of these adhesives did not appear to be a decisive factor in the formation of the hybrid layer...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{impregnation}} (VI) is a {{unit operation}} {{that allows the}} introduction of solutions into the porous structure of plant tissues. The plant tissue is immersed in the solution of interest and is then subjected to partial vacuum, causing the removal of air from the tissue. When the atmospheric pressure is restored, the solution is drawn into the tissue, replacing the air. In this way, most of the air spaces are filled by the solution, although small air pockets may still remain. VI has been extensively studied, {{particularly with regard to}} the modification of the physico-chemical properties and sensory attributes of food products. These studies include texture enhancement, enrichment of fruits and vegetables with probiotics or micronutrients, the modification of sensory attributes, and the extension of shelf life by pH reduction. VI has also been widely used as a method of pre-treatment prior to, e. g., minimal processing, freezing, or drying of fruit and vegetables. However, {{little is known about the}} metabolic consequences of <b>impregnating</b> plant <b>tissue</b> with different substances using VI. The short-term metabolic response of impregnating spinach leaves with different substances (calcium lactate, sucrose, citric acid and ascorbic acid) was investigated using isothermal calorimetry at 5 ºC, 2 h after VI treatment. The greatest increase in metabolic heat production was observed after impregnation with calcium lactate. This may be the result of metabolization of the lactate, as well as the mobilization of starch. The different impregnation solutes led to specific changes in the carbohydrate composition of the leaves during 4 days of storage, due to sugar metabolization, glucose-to-fructose interconversion and starch mobilization in the plant tissue. The effect on the nitrate content of spinach following impregnation with sucrose was also investigated. The results showed that a small amount of sucrose (5 g/ 100 ml) significantly decreased the nitrate concentration. Exogenously supplied sucrose reduced the nitrate concentration in the leaves by almost 70 % during 3 days of storage at 8 ºC, compared to non-impregnated leaves. Evidence showed that sucrose was metabolized during storage of the leaves, and that the reduction in nitrate was due to the use of sucrose as a substrate for the metabolization of stored nitrate and for respiration. Thus, VI could be beneficial in the food industry in reducing the nitrate content of spinach, leading to the improvement of nutritional characteristics. The influence of impregnation with different substances on the metabolic activity of spinach leaves in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was investigated. The gross metabolic activity of the impregnated spinach leaves changed significantly, depending on the impregnation solute and treatment temperature. Sucrose induced the highest metabolic heat production at 21 ºC, whereas calcium lactate led to the highest metabolic activity at 5 ºC. The high metabolic activity of sucrose-impregnated leaves was reflected by the high oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production measured in the packaged product stored at 21 ºC. However, this was not reflected by the changes in atmosphere inside the calcium lactate-impregnated, packaged products. The incongruity between calorimetric and atmospheric measurements may be the result of the different time scales of the measurements. The results obtained in this work have helped provide a better understanding of how impregnation of spinach leaves affects their metabolic activity. The findings could be of importance in the food industry as they provide a better understanding of how spinach leaves could be metabolically affected by a certain type of compound, thus influencing specific quality characteristics and their respiration upon packaging...|$|R
