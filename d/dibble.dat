5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by <b>Dibble,</b> Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. <b>Dibble</b> saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game beyond the reach of the defending champions.|$|E
5|$|The Indians {{selected}} Shuey {{with their}} first round draft pick, the second overall selection, in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. The Indians envisioned that Shuey could develop into a closer similar to Rob <b>Dibble</b> of the Cincinnati Reds. Shuey made his professional debut with the Columbus Red Stixx of the Class-A South Atlantic League in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by <b>Dibble,</b> contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. The holders equalised and {{took the lead in}} quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed to seal the win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the socio-economic factors influencing the adoption decision of bunds and <b>dibbling</b> among small-scale lowland rice production in Northern Region of Ghana. The empirical application involved a cross-section sample of 342 lowland rice farmers in Ghana. The empirical {{evidence suggests that}} the adoption decision of bunds and <b>dibbling</b> are made jointly. The seemingly unrelated bivariate probit estimation on plot level indicates that access to credit, project involvement, family land / labour ratio, age, reported good results, number of bikes, area under other crops and number of labour equivalents frequently ill, as well as soil type and retention capacity influence the adoption decision of bunds. <b>Dibbling</b> is determined by factors as access to credit, project involvement, family land / labour ratio, area under other crops, perception of <b>dibbling</b> and farmer’s constraints and number of bulls. Also household heads are more likely to adopt <b>dibbling.</b> Plots characteristics are provision of LRDP bunds, soil quality and water retention capacity also influence the likelihood of adoption...|$|R

5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between <b>Dibble</b> Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E

5|$|In their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs {{together}} in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie <b>Dibble.</b> Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs {{before she was}} also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.|$|E

The vast majority of seedlings are Pine Radiata but they also supply Plug Plus and Douglas fir. In peak season, they plant up to 120, 000 seedlings per day that each require a straight vertical hole of certain depth and spacing, (depending on seedling type). For example the most common seedling, Radiata pine, requires holes of approximately 10 mm diameter x 40 mm deep (figure 2). The process of making the holes is called <b>dibbling.</b> <b>Dibbling</b> {{has become a major}} problem that has resulted in an estimated 400, 000 rejections per year. An investigation of the <b>dibbling</b> process identified the following problems: • Existing human <b>dibbling</b> methods too slow and unreliable • Machine methods produce low quality holes that lead to mis-planted seedlings • Lack of flexibility of existing, methods with regard to hole size and spacing • Current methods compact the soil hindering root growth so hole drilling is preferred • Currently, <b>dibbling</b> must be done on the day of planting due to the deterioration of the bed surfac...|$|R
5|$|The American Gothic House, {{also known}} as the <b>Dibble</b> House, is a house in Eldon, Iowa, {{designed}} in the Carpenter Gothic style with a distinctive upper window. It was the backdrop of the 1930 painting American Gothic by Grant Wood. Generally considered Wood's most famous work and among the most recognized paintings in twentieth century American art, the painting is the model for hundreds of parodies across every creative medium. Grant Wood, who observed the house only twice in his lifetime, made only an initial sketch of the house—he completed American Gothic at his studio in Cedar Rapids.|$|E

Ely S. Parker, one of the administrators of the Blacksmith estate, went on to draft the surrender at Appomattox and to become the first indigenous Commissioner of Indian Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past five rounds to reach the showpiece event at Wembley.

Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David Preece and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in time to play, so Andy <b>Dibble</b> deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season. Gus Caesar replaced David O'Leary in Arsenal's starting eleven, as the Irishman was ruled out for the final having damaged his achilles weeks prior.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by <b>Dibble.</b> The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. <b>Dibble</b> (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass went over Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming <b>Dibble</b> and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got {{his head to the}} ball, but it just went over the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, this time in the 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E
