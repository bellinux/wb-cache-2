Faraday cups are used e.g. in mass spectrometers being an alternative to secondary electron multipliers. The advantage of the Faraday cup is its robustness and the possibility to measure the ion or electron stream absolutely. Furthermore the sensitiveness is constant by time and not mass-dependent. The simplest form is the following: A <b>Faraday</b> <b>detector</b> consists of a metal cup, that {{is placed in the}} path of the particle beam. The aerosol has to pass the filter inside the cup.

The common nitro-based explosives are usually detected by negative IMS while the emerging peroxide-based explosives are better detected by positive IMS. In this study, a fast polarityswitchable IMS was constructed to detect these two explosive species in a single measurement. As the large traditional <b>Faraday</b> <b>detector</b> would cause a trailing reactant ion peak (RIP), a <b>Faraday</b> <b>detector</b> with ion focusing in vicinity was developed by reducing the detector radius to 3. 3 mm and increasing the voltage difference between aperture grid and its front guard ring to 591 V, which could remove trailing peaks from RIP without loss of signal intensity.

40|$|A {{method for}} the precise and {{accurate}} {{determination of the}} tellurium (Te) isotope compositions of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) has been developed. The technique utilizes multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) with either <b>Faraday</b> <b>detectors</b> or a dual ion-counting system. The external reproducibility (2 s) for 126 Te/ 125 Te was 15 ‰ and 2 ‰ when 3 pg and 65 pg of Te were analyzed with the electron multipliers. Measurements performed on 200 pg of Te using <b>Faraday</b> <b>detectors</b> and time-resolved software displayed an external reproducibility of 8 ‰ for 126 Te/ 124 Te, whereas 3 ng Te could be measured to a precision of about 0. 6 ‰. Analyses of five CAIs from the Allende chondrite yielded Te concentrations that range from 12 to 537 ppb and the inclusions are therefore depleted in Te relative to bulk Allende by factors of about 2 to 86. The Sn/Te ratios of the CAIs are also fractionated compared to bulk Allende (which displays 124 Sn/ 128 Te ≈ 0. 1) with 124 Sn/ 128 Te ratios of about 0. 1 to 2. 5. The Te isotope measurements for these refractory inclusions yielded no 126 Te excesses from the decay of the short-lived radionuclide 126 Sn (T½ = 234, 500 years) and the most precise analysis provided a e 126 Te value of 1 +/- 6 (e 126 Te = 126 Te/ 124 Te normalized to 122 Te/ 124 Te = 0. 53594 and reported relative to the JMC Te standard). Minor differences in the Te isotope composition of the CAIs relative to the terrestrial standard and bulk Allende hint at the presence of small deficits in r-process Te isotopes or excess of s-process Te, but these nucleosynthetic anomalies are barely resolvable given the analytical uncertainties. Hence, it is also conceivable that these effects reflect small unresolved analytical artifacts. ...|$|R
40|$|Sector-field multi-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometers, {{commonly}} referred to as MC-ICP-MS, can now be fitted with multiple ion counting detectors in tandem with the array of <b>Faraday</b> <b>detectors.</b> In this paper, for the first time, we utilise such an array to measure plutonium isotopes. The chief advantage of multiple ion counting is that it obviates the need to cycle a number of small ion beams through a single collector, and hence increases the efficiency of ion beam usage. This increase in efficiency, combined with the elimination of effects produced by ion beam instability, makes multi-channel analysis an ideal method for low-level plutonium isotope analysis. Mass bias and inter-detector bias can be corrected using an external standard solution, which can be uranium or plutonium based.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} is {{the most}} powerful analytical tool used by chemists today. Its applications range from determining structures of large biomolecules to imaging of human brains. Nevertheless, magnetic resonance remains a relatively young field, in which many techniques are currently being developed that have broad applications. In this dissertation, two new techniques are presented, one that enables the determination of torsion angles in solid-state peptides and proteins, and another that involves imaging of heterogenous materials at ultra-low magnetic fields. In addition, structural studies of the prion protein via solid-state NMR are described. More specifically, work is presented in which the dependence of chemical shifts on local molecular structure is used to predict chemical shift tensors in solid-state peptides with theoretical ab initio surfaces. These predictions are then used to determine the backbone dihedral angles in peptides. This method utilizes the theoretical chemicalshift tensors and experimentally determined chemical-shift anisotropies (CSAs) to predict the backbone and side chain torsion angles in alanine, leucine, and valine residues. Additionally, structural studies of prion protein fragments are described in which conformationally-dependent chemical-shift measurements were made to gain insight into the structural differences between the various conformational states of the prion protein. These studies are of biological and pathological interest since conformational changes in the prion protein are believed to cause prion diseases. Finally, an ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging technique is described that enables imaging and characterization of heterogeneous and porous media. The notion of imaging gases at ultra-low fields would appear to be very difficult due to the prohibitively low polarization and spin densities as well as the low sensitivities of conventional <b>Faraday</b> coil <b>detectors.</b> However, Chapter 5 describes how gas imaging at ultra-low fields is realized by incorporating the high sensitivities of a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with the high polarizations attainable through optica 11 y pumping {sup 129 }Xe gas...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model of plasma flow from a metal plate hit by an intense, pulsed, electron beam aims {{to bridge the}} gap between radiation-hydrodynamics simulations and experiments, and to quantify the self-effect of the electron beam penetrating the flow. Does the flow disrupt the tight focus of the initial electron bunch, or later pulses in a train? This work aims to model the spatial distribution of plasma speed, density, degree of ionization, and magnetization to inquire. The initial solid density, several eV plasma expands to 1 cm and 10 {sup {minus} 4 } relative density by 2 {micro}s, beyond which numerical simulations are imprecise. Yet, a <b>Faraday</b> cup <b>detector</b> at the ETA-II facility is at 25 cm from the target and observes the flow after 50 {micro}s. The model helps bridge this gap. The expansion of the target plasma into vacuum is so rapid that the ionized portion of the flow departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium. When the temperature (in eV) in a parcel of fluid drops below V{sub i} x [(2 {gamma} - 2) /(5 {gamma} + 17) ], where V{sub i} is the ionization potential of the target metal (7. 8 eV for tantalum), and {gamma} is the ratio of specific heats (5 / 3 for atoms), then the fractional ionization and electron temperature in that parcel remain fixed during subsequent expansion. The freezing temperature as defined here is V{sub i}/ 19. The balance between the self-pinching force and the space charge repulsion of an electron beam changes on penetrating a flow: (i) the target plasma cancels the space-charge field, (ii) internal eddy currents arise to counter the magnetization of relativistic electrons, and (iii) electron beam heating alters the flow magnetization by changing the plasma density gradient and the magnitude of the conductivity...|$|R

Performance haracteristics (e. g.,resolving power, detection limit, transmission efficiency of ions) of this IMS-MS instrument were evaluated. Development of the IMS-MS instrument also led to a study where a proposal was made that tetraalkylammonium ions can be used as chemical standards for ESI-IMS. Second, the same drift tube design was also used to build a standalone ion mobility spectrometer equipped with a <b>Faraday</b> plate <b>detector.</b> For this highresolution (resolving power about 100 shown) IMS device, a multi-ion source platform was built, which allows the use of a range of atmospheric pressure ionization methods, such as: corona discharge chemical ionization (CD-APCI), atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), and radioactive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (R-APCI). The multi-ion source platform provides easy switching between ionization methods and both positive and negative ionization modes can be used.

40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments is {{to evaluate the}} performance of two types of ICP-MS device for measurement of actinide isotopes by laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS. The key advantage of ICP-MS compared to monitoring of radioactive decay is that the element need not decay during the measurement time. Hence ICP-MS is much faster for long-lived radionuclides. The LA process yields a transient signal. When spatially resolved analysis is required for small samples, the laser ablation sample pulse lasts only {approx} 10 seconds. It is difficult to measure signals at several isotopes with analyzers that are scanned for such a short sample transient. In this work, a time-of-flight (TOF) ICP-MS device, the GBC Optimass 8000 (Figure 1) is one instrument used. Strictly speaking, ions at different m/z values are not measured simultaneously in TOF. However, they are measured in very rapid sequence {{with little or no}} compromise between the number of m/z values monitored and the performance. Ions can be measured throughout the m/z range in single sample transients by TOF. The other ICP-MS instrument used is a magnetic sector multicollector MS, the NU Plasma 1700 (Figure 2). Up to 8 adjacent m/z values can be monitored at one setting of the magnetic field and accelerating voltage. Three of these m/z values can be measured with an electron multiplier. This device is usually used for high precision isotope ratio measurements with the <b>Faraday</b> cup <b>detectors.</b> The electron multipliers have much higher sensitivity. In our experience with the scanning magnetic sector instrument in Ames, these devices have the highest sensitivity and lowest background of any ICP-MS device. The ability to monitor several ions simultaneously, or nearly so, should make these devices valuable for the intended application: measurement of actinide isotopes at low concentrations in very small samples for nonproliferation purposes. The primary sample analyzed was an urban dust pellet reference material, NIST 1648. The ability to provide good detection limits for single laser shots is critical...|$|R
40|$|The major {{drawbacks}} of {{coal combustion}} are {{connected with the}} large emission of particulate matter. This paper deals with the experimental investigation of ultrafine (D 100 nm) and nano (D 10 nm) ashes formed during conventional high temperature pulverized coal combustion on a laboratory-scale reactor. The reactor consists of an atmospheric pressure laminar premixed flame homogeneously doped with pulverized coal particles, monodisperse in size. It allows {{the investigation of the}} early stage of ash formation. Generated aerosols, sampled using high dilution probes, are conveyed into high resolution Differential Mobility Analyzers (DMA) to perform on-line measurements of the size distribution function of ultrafine ashes. Two DMA systems are used: the first is equipped with a <b>Faraday</b> cup electrometer <b>detector</b> and identifies particles as small as 1 nm, and the second is equipped with a condensation nucleus counter and exhibits 3 nm lower detection limit. Measurements have been performed at several dilution ratios to understand the nature and behavior of detected particles. Results indicate that nanosized coal ashes are formed during pulverized coal combustion. They are the most abundant in number and also a significant fraction of ultrafine ash mass, implying they should be detected at the exhaust of pulverized coal furnaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of simple and effective methods of incorporating molecular moieties with desirable properties into {{new functional materials}} {{is one of the}} ultimate goals of material scientists. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates an easy way to accomplish this using a beam of gaseous H 2, which we call hyperthermal hydrogen induced cross-linking (HHIC). We prove theoretically and experimentally that when the kinetic energy of H 2 is raised to ~ 20 eV, it becomes a light-mass projectile which is energetic enough to knock hydrogen atoms off of organic molecules, but not other heavier atoms. By developing a reactor to inexpensively generate a high flux of H 2 with the appropriate kinetic energy, we exploit this selective C–H cleavage method to create carbon radicals, which then recombine to yield covalent cross-links. Using this method to cross-link organic moieties of our choice with no change in their desirable properties, we have a) fabricated functional materials with tailor-made mechanical, chemical, and biomedical properties, and b) modified electrical properties of conducting and semiconducting polymers. Chapter 2 provides an insight into the inception of the HHIC reactor, its operation, and necessary theoretical background of electron cyclotron resonance plasma, gas phase collisions involved in HHIC, and hydrogen abstraction. We also discuss energy distribution of cross-linking projectiles as measured by quadrupole mass spectrometer and <b>Faraday</b> cup <b>detector.</b> We have found that under standard HHIC conditions, the number of hyperthermal projectiles doubles with respect to the number of collision initiating particles, yielding a high-throughput of the HHIC method. Chapter 3 focuses on the evaluation of the HHIC method in terms of degree of cross-linking, topographical, chemical, and electrical changes, and selectivity towards chemical functional groups. We show that the HHIC method is very gentle in treating chemical functionalities. However, we also show that the HHIC reactor in its current configuration is responsible for exposing sensitive organic semiconducting materials to deep vacuum UV irradiation, damaging their pi–pi* conjugated system and negatively effecting their electrical properties. Chapter 4 extends the study of HHIC by exploring its capability of grafting organic moieties onto polymer surfaces disallowed under normal conditions...|$|R
40|$|Neutron therapy beams are {{obtained}} by accelerating protons or deuterons on Beryllium. These neutron therapy beams present comparable dosimetric characteristics {{as those for}} photon beams obtained with linear accelerators; for instance, the penetration of a p(65) +Be neutron beam is comparable with the penetration of an 8 MV photon beam. In order to be competitive with conventional photon beam therapy, the dosimetric characteristics of the neutron beam should therefore not deviate too much from the photon beam characteristics. This paper presents a brief summary of the neutron beams used in radiotherapy. The dosimetry of the clinical neutron beams is described. Finally, recent and future developments {{in the field of}} physics for neutron therapy is mentioned. In the last two decades, a considerable number of centres have established radiotherapy treatment facilities using proton beams with energies between 50 and 250 MeV. Clinical applications require a relatively uniform dose to be delivered to the volume to be treated, and for this purpose the proton beam has to be spread out, both laterally and in depth. The technique is called 'beam modulation' and creates a region of high dose uniformity referred to as the 'spread-out Bragg peak'. Meanwhile, reference dosimetry in these beams had to catch up with photon and electron beams for which a much longer tradition of dosimetry exists. Proton beam dosimetry can be performed using different types of dosemeters, such as calorimeters, <b>Faraday</b> cups, track <b>detectors</b> and ionisation chambers. National standard dosimetry laboratories will, however, not provide a standard for the dosimetry of proton beams. To achieve uniformity on an international level, the use of an ionisation chamber should be considered. This paper reviews and summarises the basic principles and recommendations for the absorbed dose determination in a proton beam, utilising ionisation chambers calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water. These recommendations are based on the recent IAEA TRS 398 Code of Practice: 'Absorbed Dose Determination in External Beam Radiotherapy: An International Code of Practice for Dosimetry based on Standards of Absorbed Dose to Water'...|$|R
40|$|Spatiotemporal {{variability}} in the carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter (OM) preserves information about {{the evolution of the}} biosphere and of the exogenic carbon cycle as a whole. Primary compositions, and imprints of the post-depositional processes that obscure them, exist at the scale of individual sedimentary grains (mm to micron). Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) (1) enables analysis at these scales and in petrographic context, (2) permits morphological and compositional characterization of the analyte and associated minerals prior to isotopic analysis, and (3) reveals patterns of variability homogenized by bulk techniques. Here we present new methods for in situ organic carbon isotope analysis with sub-permil precision and spatial resolution to 1 micron using SIMS, as well as new data acquired from a suite of Archean rocks. Three analytical protocols were developed for the CAMECA ims 1280 at WiscSIMS to analyze domains of varying size and carbon concentration. Average reproducibility (at 2 SD) using a 6 micron spot size with two <b>Faraday</b> cup <b>detectors</b> was 0. 4 %, and 0. 8 % for analyses using 1 micron and 3 micron spot sizes with a Faraday cup (for C- 12) and an electron multiplier (for C- 13). Eight coals, two ambers, a shungite, and a graphite were evaluated for micron-scale isotopic heterogeneity, and LCNN anthracite (delta C- 13 = - 23. 56 +/- 0. 1 %, 2 SD) was chosen as the working standard. Correlation between instrumental bias and H/C was observed and calibrated for each analytical session using organic materials with H/C between 0. 1 and 1. 5 (atomic), allowing a correction based upon a C- 13 H/C- 13 measurement included in every analysis. Matrix effects of variable C/SiO 2 were evaluated by measuring mm to sub-micron graphite domains in quartzite from Bogala mine, Sri Lanka. Apparent instrumental bias and C- 12 count rate are correlated in this case, but this may be related to a crystal orientation effect in graphite. Analyses of amorphous Archean OM suggest that instrumental bias is consistent for 12 C count rates as low as 10 % relative to anthracite. Samples from the ABDP- 9 (n= 3; Mount McRae Shale, approximately 2. 5 Ga), RHDH 2 a (n= 2; Carrawine Dolomite and Jeerinah Fm, approximately 2. 6 Ga), WRL 1 (n= 3; Wittenoom Fm, Marra Mamba Iron Formation, and Jeerinah Fm, approximately 2. 6 Ga), and SV 1 (n= 1; Tumbiana Fm, approximately 2. 7 Ga) drill cores, each previously analyzed for bulk organic carbon isotope composition, yielded 100 new, in situ data from Neoarchean sedimentary OM. In these samples, delta C- 13 varies between - 53. 1 and - 28. 3 % and offsets between in situ and bulk compositions range from - 8. 3 to 18. 8 %. In some cases, isotopic composition and mode of occurrence (e. g. morphology and mineral associations) are statistically correlated, enabling the identification of distinct reservoirs of OM. Our results support previous evidence for gradients of oxidation with depth in Neoarchean environments driven by photosynthesis and methane metabolism. The relevance of these findings to questions of bio- and syngenicity as well as the alteration history of previously reported Archean OM will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{solar wind}} is a {{supersonic}} flow of magnetized plasma. It is time-dependent on all scales and expands with distance. The flow has fluctuations {{on a broad}} range of scales and frequencies. This fluctuations are not just convected outward but show energy cascades among the different scales. The solar wind turbulence peculiar phenomenology has been comprehensively reviewed by Tu and Marsch [11] and Bruno and Carbone [2]. As the distance from the sun increases, the available data on plasma and magnetic field become increasingly scarce. At distance of the order of 1 astronomic unit (AU), several measurement have been performed by various crafts, but, nowadays, only the Voyager spacecrafts can measure data in the heliosheath, the outermost layer in heliosphere where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of the interstellar gas, and only the Voyager 2 craft can measure both plasma and magnetic fields (Voyager 1 can measure only the magnetic field, and Pioneer 10 and 11 has ceased communications). Taken together, the Voyager 1 and 2 probes have collected over 11 year of data in the heliosheath. The Voyager plasma experiment observes plasma currents in the energy/charge range 10 – 5950 eV /q using four modulated-grid <b>Faraday</b> cup <b>detectors</b> [1]. The observed currents are fit to convected isotropic proton Maxwellian distributions to derive the parameters (velocity, density, and temperature) used in this work. Magnetic field and plasma data are taken the COHO web site and MIT Space Plasma Group repository. Several studies have been done in order to extend the existing models to make them consistent with the energetic particles and magnetic fields measured in the heliosheath, but so far an exhaustive explanation has not yet been obtained. In particular, the differences between the energetic particle intensity variations seen by the two crafts are unexplained. The electron intensity measured by Voyager 2 varies steeper by a factor of 10 in a single year, while the same quantity from Voyager 1 changes gradually over time. [7] A possible explanation can be the presence of bubble of turbulence that travels in the heliosheat. Therefore, a characterization of turbulence and its intermittency is necessary to explain this phenomenology. The aim of this work is to provide the first spectral analysis of heliosheath solar wind, trying to characterize the plasma turbulence in that region by estimating the spectral slopes. A first result is represented in figure 2, where {{it can be seen that}} the low frequency spectral slope is lower when the electron intensity is low. In order to compute spectra, signal reconstruction techniques are mandatory: at distance over 80 AU, available data are very spotty. For the plasma velocity, there are 97 % of missings due to unsteadiness in the signals, see 1, the most important of which are: tracking gaps due to the V 2 location and due to limited deep space network availability; interference from other instruments; possible errors in the measurement chain (from the Faraday cups up to the data acquisition system and the signal shipping to Earth); the temporal sequence of the nuclear propulsion used to control the Voyager trajectory and to assist in several critical repositionings of the craft. For data recovery, we mainly use two different methods. The first method used is based on the correlation computation [8] that allows to reconstruct correlations and use it to compute spectra. Better results can be achieved implementing the maximum likelihood reconstruction by Rybicki and Press [10] based on a minimum-variance recovery with a stochastic component. The second methods comes from the Compress Sensing, a recent technique widely used in telecommunications, that provides the reconstruction of the signal from a sparse dataset [3], by using sparse Fourier matrices [9]. The methods used have been previously tested on 1979 data and on synthetic fluid turbulent fields. Results were in good agreement with the literature, and allows to compute largest spectra of solar wind at 5 AU, with frequencies ranging from 10 - 7 to 10 - 2 Hz [4, 5, 6]...|$|R
