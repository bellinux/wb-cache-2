40|$|The {{application}} of the method of dark field microscopy {{for the study of}} colored objects of material technology was researched. The capability of corrosive damage analysis and determination of the thickness of the metal coating were demonstrated. The performance capability of analysis of «reflection» in the dark field during the study of non-metallic materials – orthopedic implants and <b>fireclay</b> <b>refractory</b> were tested. An example of defect detection of carbon coating was displayed. </p...|$|E
40|$|For {{production}} of <b>fireclay</b> <b>refractory</b> castables, various deflocculants are used. In recent years new polycarboxylate ethers-based deflocculants appeared {{and so far}} their properties comparing to those of common deflocculants are little investigated. This study compares the effect of content of two deflocculants, sodium tripoliphosphate and polycarboxylate ethers Castament FS- 20, on hydration of aluminate cement, on structure forming during it, pH and electrical conductivity in suspensions. It was established {{that the increase in}} content of deflocculant sodium tripoliphosphate, as a binder, in the suspension results in a considerable increase of electrical conductivity, while the increase of Castament FS- 20 reduces pH values. The study also evaluates the effect of content of deflocculants on duration of exothermal reaction in paste of castable with medium content of cement, on formation of structure, physical-mechanical properties of castable. it was established by means of compressive strength tests that the increase in content of sodium tripoliphosphate affects the strength properties of castables, meanwhile Castament FS- 20, on the contrary, increases the compressive strength of castable samples. Dilatometric test helped to establish a different effect of deflocculants on processes of linear changes at high temperatures. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of some Nigerian clays as refractory raw materials was investigated. The clay samples were first analysed {{to determine their}} chemical compositions. Fireclay bricks test specimens were prepared by standard method. They were then tested for properties such as apparent porosity, bulk density, thermal shock resistance, fired shrinkage, refractoriness and cold crushing strength. The result obtained showed that both test samples qualify as high melting <b>fireclays.</b> The <b>refractory</b> properties measured revealed them as being usable as refractory bricks when blended...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} results on heat-resistant concrete made of mixed binding material, including Portland cement, aluminum and chrome waste, nano-technogenic raw {{materials in the}} form of sludge aluminum caustic etch are presented. The presence of aluminous component in the floured heat-resisting additive with different dimensions made it possible to bind the full calcium oxide as part of a mixed heat-resistant binder. The data on phosphate binders synthesizing is provided. The application of nano-technogenic raw materials {{in the form of}} sludge provided the completeness of the synthesizing liquid phosphate bonds process, excluding external heating. The obtained aluminophosphate bond was used in the compositions of heavy heat-resistant concrete and in the structural and chemical modification of piece ceramic refractories. The use of liquid aluminophosphate bonds in the structural and chemical modification of <b>fireclay</b> and high-alumina <b>refractories</b> instead of pure phosphoric acid has significantly increased their technical efficiency. Aluminophosphate bond application in the compositions of heat-resistant lining materials has considerably increased their physical and thermal performance...|$|R
5000|$|They are {{one type}} of [...] "cross-draught" [...] kilns, where the flames travel more or less horizontally, rather than up from or down to the floor. The kilns were {{normally}} made of brick; sometimes most of the structure was dug out below the loess soil, with only the dome and chimney protruding above ground. In either case the interior was normally lined with a <b>refractory</b> <b>fireclay.</b> In some cases, especially in later periods, the fire box was approached by a tunnel. Initially the kilns were fired with wood, but during the Northern Song period (960-1127) {{there was a general}} switch to coal, easily found in north China, which required a smaller fire box, but the introduction of saggars to protect the pieces from gritty coal ash. This changed the reducing quality of the atmosphere during firing, which affected the colours of various wares, wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one. A firing might take as long as two weeks, including the cooling time.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile {{incinerators}} {{are important}} for eliminating hazardous waste from industry, there are few publications on the corrosion of secondary combustion chambers. The sudden refractory failure results in high costs and work stoppages. Thus, corrosion in <b>fireclay</b> and bauxite-clay <b>refractories</b> exposed for 50 months to the harsh atmosphere in the chamber (H 2 O, O- 2, CO 2, SO 2, HCl, alkali vapors, etc.) was investigated. The operating temperatures of 930 - 1000 degrees C heat the inner refractory face up to 950 degrees C and the exterior face to 750 degrees C. X-ray diffraction revealed that condensed alkali and sulfur compounds interacted with refractories. Thermodynamic calculations determined the critical chemical reactions. Our findings show a successive corrosion mechanism that starts with the condensation of thenardite (Na 2 SO 4) and finishes with expansive phases. In fireclay bricks, the reaction with free silica led to liquid phases and slow creep. Sudden lining breakdowns were provoked by nepheline and nosean. Contrary to expectations, nepheline was not formed in the bauxite-clay bricks. Instead, only nosean was formed. In the literature, under laboratory conditions, no nosean has been observed in hot corrosion experiments. Perhaps, nosean requires several months to years to form inside the secondary combustion chamber. Our work indicates that to impede these corrosion processes, refractories should contain as little silica as possible...|$|R
