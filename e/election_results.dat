5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council <b>election</b> <b>results</b> had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|E

5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} election. The final <b>election</b> <b>results</b> gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes cast. His large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the {{landslide}} win by fellow Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson for President in the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{also argued}} that if the Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about <b>election</b> <b>results</b> is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of separation of powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Taylor secured just 2,383 more votes than Goebel. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly {{challenged}} the <b>election</b> <b>results.</b> Under the Goebel Election Law, a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were {{to review the}} results and certify the winner in the contest. Two {{of the members of}} the board had openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in a surprising decision, the board voted 2—1 to certify Taylor as the winner.|$|E
5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, {{although}} the wording of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the <b>election</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E

5|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1860 showed Kentucky's mixed sentiments {{when the state}} gave John Bell 45% of the popular vote, John C. Breckinridge 36%, Stephen Douglas 18%, and Abraham Lincoln less than 1%. Historian Allan Nevins interpreted the <b>election</b> <b>results</b> to mean that Kentuckians strongly opposed both secession and coercion against the secessionists. The majority coalition of Bell and Douglas supporters {{was seen as a}} solid moderate Unionist position that opposed precipitate action by extremists on either side.|$|E
5|$|William Sylvester Taylor (October 10, 1853 – August 2, 1928) was the 33rd Governor of Kentucky. He was {{initially}} declared {{the winner of}} the disputed gubernatorial election of 1899, but the Kentucky General Assembly, dominated by the Democrats, reversed the <b>election</b> <b>results,</b> giving the victory to his Democratic Party (United States) opponent, William Goebel. Taylor served only 50 days as governor.|$|E
5|$|According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl {{organised}} {{a meeting}} between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early <b>election</b> <b>results</b> in March dented this confidence.|$|E

5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local <b>election</b> <b>results</b> were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin.

5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, the <b>election</b> <b>results</b> were immediately challenged. With Democrats {{in control of}} both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E

As mayor he improved sanitary and security conditions in the city. In August 2001 he announced his candidacy as an independent in the December 2001 presidential election. He then took office as President in 2002 amidst a dispute over <b>election</b> <b>results</b> in which he successfully pressed his claim to have won {{a majority in the}} first round. Under the leadership of Jacques Sylla, Ravalomanana's Prime Minister from 2002 to 2007, the political party Tiako i Madagasikara (TIM) was founded in 2002 to support Ravalomanana's presidency and came to dominate legislative and local elections. He was re-elected in December 2006, again with a majority in the first round.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an election law {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all <b>election</b> <b>results.</b> The board was to be appointed by the General Assembly, {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The law passed the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E

Despite these irregularities, MDRM won 71 percent of the vote, {{and none of the}} PADESM candidates was elected. While MDRM won decisive victories in the central and eastern province, results were close in the western province, where the MDRM candidate Joseph Raseta won 21,475 votes and the PADESM candidate Totelehibe won 19,014 votes.|$|E
