60|$|I shall {{begin with}} those which {{relate to the}} {{possession}} and inheritance of landed property in Popish hands. The first operation of those acts upon this object was wholly to {{change the course of}} descent by the Common Law, to take away the right of primogeniture, and, in lieu thereof, to substitute and establish a new species of Statute Gavelkind. By this law, on the death of a Papist possessed of an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple or in fee tail, the land is to be divided by equal portions between all the male children; and those portions are likewise to be parcelled out, share and share alike, amongst the descendants of each son, and so to proceed in a similar distribution ad infinitum. From this regulation it was proposed that some important consequences should follow. First, by taking away the right of primogeniture, perhaps in the very first generation, certainly in the second, the families of Papists, however respectable, and their fortunes, however considerable, would be wholly dissipated, and reduced to obscurity and indigence, without any possibility that they should repair them by their industry or abilities,--being, as we shall see anon, disabled from every species of permanent acquisition. Secondly, by this law the right of testamentation is taken away, which the inferior tenures had always enjoyed, and all tenures from the 27th Hen. VIII; Thirdly, the right of settlement was taken away, that no such persons should, from the moment the act passed, be enabled to advance themselves in fortune or connection by marriage, being disabled from making any disposition, in consideration of such marriage, but what the law had previously regulated: the reputable establishment of the eldest son, as representative of the family, or to settle a jointure, being commonly the great object in such settlements, which was the very power which the law had absolutely taken away.|$|E

The other two thirds were held, in 1784, by William Richard Wilson and Jane Anne Eleanor, his wife, who appear to have given up their share to Henry Greswolde Lewis. He was succeeded in 1829 by his , Edmund Meysey Wigley, who assumed the name Greswolde and died unmarried in 1833. On his death, Henry Wigley, who also assumed the name Greswolde, became tenant for life under the will of Henry Greswolde Lewis, {{and he and his}} son, Edmund Greswolde, who was tenant in line, barred the <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> tail and conveyed the estates to the use of Henry Greswolde for life, with remainder to Edmund Greswolde <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple.

On his death at Bath six years later, his earldom passed to his second (but eldest surviving) son Washington, whilst his barony passed to his granddaughter, Elizabeth, her father and elder brother having died in 1698 and 1714, respectively. Washington received the family's Northamptonshire <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple, while those in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire were to some extent encumbered by annuities to his four younger half-brothers and a jointure to the Dowager Countess Selina. She also received Heath Lane Lodge, which was then to go to her eldest son; he also inherited the Ettington Park <b>estate</b> near Stratford-on-Avo <b>in</b> Warwickshire, and he and his three full brothers were jointly left the Earl's Irish lands in County Monaghan.

50|$|It {{followed}} that the plaintiff could derive no aid from any act of Congress {{passed since the}} first day of January 1852. On that day, all interest and estate of the heirs of Archibald Gordon in the lands covered by his entry recorded on January 1, 1823, and his survey recorded on November 6, 1824, ceased and determined. The plaintiff therefore has failed to make good her averment that she has an equitable <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple to the premises in controversy. She has therefore shown no right to the relief prayed by her bill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "fee" [...] has its origins in feudalism. William Blackstone defined fee simple as the <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> land that a person has when the lands are given {{to him and his}} heirs absolutely, without any end or limit put to his <b>estate.</b> Land held <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple can be {{conveyed}} to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be mortgaged or put up as security.Owners of real property <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.|$|R

50|$|The {{reign of}} Edward I is notable for three leading statutes, all {{passed in the}} {{interests}} of the superior lords. The 1279 the Statute of Mortmain was the first of a long series directed against the acquisition of land by religious and charitable corporations. In 1285 the statute De Donis Conditionalibus forbade the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs of his body, which before the statute usually became on the birth of an heir at once alienable, and so the lord lost his escheat. The statute Quia Emptores preserved those rights of the lords which were up to that time subject to be defeated by subinfeudation, by enacting that in any alienation of lands the alienee should hold them of the same lord of the fee as the alienor. Since 1290 it has been impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be held of a mesne lord, or to reserve a rent upon a grant of an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> (unless in the form of a rent-charge), or to create a new manor. The statute, however, does not bind the crown. The practical effect of the statute was to make the transfer of land thenceforward more of a commercial and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of elegit was introduced by the Statute of Westminster II in 1285 as a creditor's remedy over real estate. It has, however, been considerably modified by subsequent legislation.|$|E
40|$|Under {{the common}} law one who held an estate in lands in fee simple {{absolute}} was the sole owner of such lands, and his right to enjoy the estate and exercise all the powers and privileges incident thereto could not be restricted by the devisor or grantor. The rights and privileges incident to an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple constituted the estate-they were all essential, they were its bone, sinew and blood, {{and in the absence}} of any one of them the estate was regarded as less than a fee simple. Among those essential rights were the right of possession, the right to alienate by deed, or devise by will, or to have the estate descend to the heir at law. Since those rights are incident to a fee simple, when a testator devises such an estate, the devisee obtains those rights, not under the will but as incident to the estate devised. Giving and withholding being incompatible acts, a testator can not devise an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple and withhold from the devisee any of the rights, privileges and powers, incident and essential to the estate devised...|$|E
50|$|Lending upon {{security}} of a mortgage on land <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> tail was risky, since at {{the death of the}} tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest <b>estate</b> a possessor <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.|$|R
50|$|Andrew's father, Vincent Corbet, had {{inherited}} vast estates when his brother Richard died in 1606: 12,600 acres in Shropshire, concentrated mainly between the county town and Market Drayton, on the north-western edge, {{as well as}} 7,000 acres in Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. However, there were major problems. Richard's debts were huge, and he left the new Elizabethan building at Moreton Corbet Castle, begun by Robert, still unfinished after a quarter century or more in construction. Although most of the <b>estates</b> were <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> tail male, preventing their dispersal, substantial lands were not. This meant that Robert Corbet's surviving daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Sir Henry Wallop could mount claims to them, {{and in some cases}} had already taken possession. Most pressing of all, Richard's widow, Judith Austin, a forceful woman, thrice-married and very wealthy, held large estates as her jointure. Worse still, Judith had potential claims on more, as the improvident Richard had made up her jointure in questionable ways, acknowledging as much in his rambling will.|$|R

40|$|As {{the right}} to sell may exist either {{as a result of}} ownership, or by virtue of a power without or {{independent}} of ownership, it is sometimes a question whether words indicating a right to sell, contained in an instrument granting an estate, are intended to give a power, or are merely descriptive of the rights incident to the estate given. When property is devised without any designation of the estate given, and the devise is followed by words indicating that the devisee is to have the right of absolute disposal in fee, or to sell in fee, it has often been held that the words indicating an absolute power of disposal show that the devisee was intended by the testator to have an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee,</b> not a life estate with a testamentary power of appointing the reversion. (See note 18 L. R. A. N. S. 463.)

Such a fund would also help Lettie get off her back numerous relatives who had shown up since the news spread that she would become rich.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the doctrine of title by possession and the doctrine of relative title. Many property lawyers believe that these doctrines are elementary, important and interesting. But, while virtually everyone accepts that possession of land or chattels is a source of title and that titles are relative, the doctrines have long been a focus of debate. The nature of possession, the nature of the possessorâs title, and the relationships between possession, relative title and ownership have been particularly contentious. Accordingly, this thesis seeks to provide sound answers to the following questions: (1) what, in this context, is possession? (2) What {{is the nature of the}} title that is acquired by taking possession of land or chattels? (3) Does English law recognise landownership and chattel-ownership?âand, if it does, is a person who acquires, by virtue of his or her possession, a title to land or chattels the (or an) owner of the land or chattels? It is argued in Chapter 2 that, for the purposes of the doctrine of title by possession, the general rule is that a person is in possession of land or chattels if and only if she has: (i) a sufficient degree of exclusive physical control; and (ii) an intention to possess. Chapters 3 â 5 are concerned with the second question. It is argued that, upon obtaining possession, a person acquires, in cases involving land, an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple absolute in possession and, in cases involving chattels, a general property interest. Chapter 6 {{is concerned with}} the third question. It is argued that English law does recognise landownership and chattel-ownership; and that a person who acquires a title by obtaining possession of land or chattels owns the land or chattels if her title is supreme but not if it is inferior. </p...|$|E
40|$|Professor Gray, in {{the first}} edition of his great work, 2 ̆ 2 The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2 ̆ 2 Section 31 and following, contended that the Statute Quia Emptores by putting an end to tenure between feoffor and feoffee of an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple, {{incidentally}} put an end to possibility of reverter to the feoffer on failure of the condition in a determihable fee. Specifically he says that upon dissolution of an eleemosynary corporation a terminable gift to such corporation does not revert to the donor, as is said by Lord Coke, Co. LITT. 13 b, but escheats. For reversion depends on tenure, and the Statute by destroying tenure ends possibility of reverter.

Holdgate Fee was a rectangular plot of land located at the foot of Old Street, on the east side of the street, near the site of the former ford. The name came about as for a long period it was an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> land (a <b>fee)</b> belonging to the manor of Steventon, which in turn was owned by the lordship of Castle Holdgate. Common with the other parts of Ludford's parish that lay north of the Teme, it belonged to Shropshire and the hundred of Culvestan, later Munslow.|$|R
