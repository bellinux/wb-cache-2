Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{properties}} of a popular method for elicitation of valuations from experimental subjects, the multiple price list format. The main advantages of this format are that it is relatively transparent to subjects and provides simple incentives for truthful revelation. The main disadvantages are that it only <b>elicits</b> interval responses, and could be susceptible to framing effects. We consider extensions to address and evaluate these concerns {{in the context of}} <b>eliciting</b> willingness to pay for products. We find that the multiple price list can <b>elicit</b> relatively precise valuations for products, and that those valuations are robust to possible framing effects. It therefore offers an attractive procedure for <b>eliciting</b> valuations for goods. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract * This paper {{describes}} the emotion elicitation {{process of the}} Salt & Pepper architecture for autonomous agents.

We propose to add emotion <b>eliciting</b> inhibition times to emotion <b>eliciting</b> rules in order to avoid the repeated generation of the same emotion due to the same circumstances. Finally, we propose the conditioned emotion <b>eliciting</b> chunk, which sequentially generates conditioned emotions. This new emotion <b>eliciting</b> structure is useful to initiate emotion processes in stereotypical situations in which the initiated emotion depends on the emotion that has previously been generated. Our experiments were done during the SAFIRA European Project. ...|$|R
