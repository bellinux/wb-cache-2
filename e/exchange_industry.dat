50|$|Poverty {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} risk factors that makes victims, particularly women and girls, vulnerable: the Nepali PRSP (Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers) identifies that 38% of its population live on or below the poverty line. Poverty and lack of employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas, force individuals or families to migrate to more urban areas or accept distant job offers. This participation in rural-urban migration increases the risk of being trafficked for many Nepali women and girls. In addition, the rise of the carpet industry in Nepal as {{the greatest}} foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>industry</b> created a demand for cheap child labor and slave labor. Studies indicated that a large number of children working in the factories were enslaved and often sexually abused; the factories then became transit centers for trafficking girls to India.

This result indicates that export-intensive industries tend to have a lower profitability in Taiwan, because export firms act as price takers in international markets.
