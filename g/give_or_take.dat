5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> items away from him or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally called Kochab, Beta Ursae Minoris at {{apparent}} magnitude 2.08 {{is only slightly}} less bright than Polaris. Located around 131light-years away from Earth, it is an orange giant—an evolved star that has used up the hydrogen in its core and moved off the main sequence—of spectral type K4III. Slightly variable {{over a period of}} 4.6days, Kochab has had its mass estimated at 1.3times that of the Sun via measurement of these oscillations. Kochab is 450 times more luminous than the Sun and has 42 times its diameter, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,130K. Estimated to be around 2.95 billion years old, <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> 1 billion years, Kochab was announced to have a planetary companion around 6.1times as massive as Jupiter with an orbit of 522days.|$|E
25|$|Mars' {{temperature}} and circulation vary {{from year to}} year (as expected for any planet with an atmosphere). Mars lacks oceans, a source of much inter-annual variation on Earth. Mars Orbiter Camera data beginning in March 1999 and covering 2.5 Martian years show that Martian weather tends to be more repeatable and hence more predictable than that of Earth.

Yet Australia, <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> a few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to <b>give</b> (<b>or</b> <b>take)</b> liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Nelson Story {{traveled}} to Texas and spent $10,000 for 1000 (some accounts indicate possibly {{as many as}} 3000) head of Longhorn cattle. 1866 was {{the first year after}} the end of the American Civil War and the economy of Texas, as in the rest of the former Confederacy, was devastated. However there were significant numbers of cattle roaming Texas which could be had for very little money. Also, there was great demand for beef in the northern states along with money to pay for it. So many returning Confederate soldiers begged or borrowed a stake to get a herd together. Many others signed on as trail drive cowboys. <b>Give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take,</b> about 260,000 cattle were driven north from Texas that summer toward the nearest rail shipping point at Sedalia, Missouri in hopes of selling them there for a quick profit. To reach Sedalia, the cattle first had to be driven through the territory which was to become Oklahoma, but which at the time was the Indian Territory. This was the domain of the remnants of the Five Civilized Nations who had survived the Trail of Tears. While the tribes previously had tolerated the passage of a few herds, an exodus of this magnitude threatened their ability to support their own grazing cattle. Rather than blocking the herds entirely, they decided to charge 10 cents a head for passage. The drovers mostly paid the fee.|$|E

50|$|Patients are ideally nursed in a kind, nonfrustrating environment, since, when <b>given</b> <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> in high doses, benzodiazepines {{are more}} likely to cause {{paradoxical}} reactions. If shown sympathy, even quite crudely feigned, patients may respond solicitously, but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues. Opportunistic counseling has limited value here, as the patient is unlikely to recall this later, owing to drug-induced anterograde amnesia.|$|R

500|$|After {{the release}} and minor {{success of the}} band's debut album, Gish, The Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as [...] "the next Nirvana". However, the band was {{experiencing}} several difficulties at the time. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin; James Iha and D'arcy Wretzky had recently broken up their romantic relationship; and Billy Corgan had become overweight, depressed {{to the point of}} contemplating suicide, and plagued by writer's block. Corgan recalled that [...] "after the first album, I became completely suicidal. It was an eight-month depression, <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> a month, and I was pretty suicidal for about two or three months." [...] Under the pressure and other complications, the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in Atlanta to record the follow-up to Gish.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "This Is Not Happening" [...] {{was mostly}} positive. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "one of the strongest episodes of the season, <b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take</b> a Monica Reyes." [...] He applauded the reintroduction of Jeremiah Smith—a character he felt [...] "the show had mostly forgotten about"—and wrote highly of Scott as Absalom, calling him a [...] "one of the episode's highlights." [...] VanDerWerff also wrote that the episode, along with the previous episode [...] "Per Manum" [...] was a showcase for Anderson's acting ability. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two noted, and praised, that the true tragedy of the episode is the fact that, despite her increased role as the reluctant believer, the way Scully deals with Absalom and Jeremiah Smith [...] "in a strictly scientific way", instead of taking the [...] "leap of faith", prevents her from finding and saving Mulder in time.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} issue Giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes, {{in that he}} [...] "knew from the start" [...] {{it would be a}} [...] "costume film." [...] To realize that vision, he brought in character designer Jean Gillmore to act as a dedicated [...] "costume designer". While traditional animation simply integrates costume design with character design and treats clothing as merely part of the characters, computer-generated animation regards costume as almost a separate entity with its own properties and behaviors– and Frozen required a level of as-yet untried detail, down to minutiae like fabrics, buttons, trim, and stitching. Gillmore explained that her [...] "general approach was to meld the historic silhouettes of 1840 Western Europe (<b>give</b> <b>or</b> <b>take),</b> with the shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early Norway, circa 19th century." [...] This meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet, linen, and silk. During production, Giaimo and Gillmore [...] "ran around" [...] supplying various departments with real-world samples to use as references; they were able to draw upon both the studio's own in-house library of fabric samples and the resources of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts' costume division in Fullerton, California. The film's [...] "look development artists" [...] (the Disney job title for texture artists) created the digitally painted simulation of the appearance of surfaces, while other departments dealt with movement, rigging and weight, thickness and lighting of textile animation.|$|E
2500|$|Nightwish {{has also}} been noted {{as a source of}} {{inspiration}} for other bands.

Power metal band Sonata Arctica's lead singer Tony Kakko has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.
