5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI reference <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

5|$|Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations {{where each}} tile <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> {{the set of}} points closest {{to one of the}} points in a {{discrete}} set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.|$|E
5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products.

5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally {{no more than a}} few degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
5|$|In pregnancy, {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a TSH between 2.5 and 10mIU/l with {{a normal}} thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10mIU/l {{are considered to be}} overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal.
