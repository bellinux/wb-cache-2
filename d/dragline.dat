5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} <b>dragline</b> of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the <b>dragline</b> to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a <b>dragline</b> as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a <b>dragline</b> made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a <b>dragline</b> made by the female, and P. schultzi {{typically}} copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E
500|$|P. labiata {{females are}} {{extremely}} aggressive to other females, trying to invade {{and take over}} each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A laboratory test showed how they minimise the risk of meeting each other, by recognising pieces with blotting paper containing their own silk <b>draglines</b> and pieces contain other P. labiata females' <b>draglines.</b> If obstacles {{make it impossible to}} see whether the other is physically present, she avoids blotting paper containing the other's <b>draglines,</b> but moves with no constraint if she can see that the other female is not around. <b>Draglines</b> seem to act as territory marks, much as many mammals identify conspecifics by scent marking. P. labiata females also avoid rival females of higher fighting ability and spend more time around less powerful fighters. A laboratory test collected samples of the <b>draglines</b> [...] of equal-sized females and then pitted some of them in contests. Other females avoided the <b>draglines</b> of the victors, and spent the majority of their time on <b>draglines</b> of the losers. Similar tests showed that females of P. fimbriata from Australia and P. schultzi from Kenya do not avoid <b>draglines</b> of a powerful fighter.|$|R
5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk <b>draglines</b> and some containing another male's <b>draglines.</b> Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' <b>draglines,</b> while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' <b>draglines.</b> This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' <b>draglines.</b> A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|R
50|$|The {{market for}} <b>draglines</b> began {{shrinking}} rapidly after the {{boom of the}} 1960s and 1970s which led to more mergers. P&H's acquisition of Page in 1988 along with Bucyrus' acquisition of Ransomes & Rapier in 1988 and Marion in 1997 {{cut the number of}} worldwide suppliers of heavy <b>draglines</b> by more than half. Today, P&H and Caterpillar are the only remaining manufacturers of large <b>draglines.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails <b>Dragline</b> a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy density}} of <b>dragline</b> spider silk is roughly 1.2x108J/m3.|$|E
25|$|In {{detail a}} <b>dragline</b> silk's tensile {{strength}} {{is comparable to}} that of high-grade alloy steel (450 − 2000 MPa), and about half as strong as aramid filaments, such as Twaron or Kevlar (3000 MPa).|$|E

50|$|P. labiata females can {{discriminate}} between the <b>draglines</b> of familiar and unfamiliar individuals {{of the same}} species. and between their own <b>draglines</b> and those of conspecifics. The ability to recognize individuals is a necessary prerequisite for social behavior.|$|R
50|$|On crane-type <b>draglines,</b> {{the bucket}} {{can also be}} 'thrown' by winding up to the jib and then {{releasing}} a clutch on the drag cable. This would then swing the bucket like a pendulum. Once the bucket had passed the vertical, the hoist cable would be released thus throwing the bucket. On smaller <b>draglines,</b> a skilled operator could make the bucket land about one-half {{the length of the}} jib further away than if it had just been dropped. On larger <b>draglines,</b> this is not a common practice.|$|R
25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} <b>dragline</b> silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of {{high tensile strength}} and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb {{a large amount of}} energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress-strain curve).|$|E
25|$|While {{unlikely}} to be relevant in nature, <b>dragline</b> silks can hold their strength below −40°C (−40°F) and up to 220°C (428°F). As occurs in many materials, spider silk fibres undergo a glass transition. The glass-transition temperature depends on the humidity, as water is a plasticiser for the silk.|$|E
25|$|When {{exposed to}} water, <b>dragline</b> silks undergo supercontraction, {{shrinking}} up to 50% {{in length and}} behaving like a weak rubber under tension. Many hypotheses have been suggested as to its use in nature, with the most popular being to automatically tension webs built in the night using the morning dew.|$|E

40|$|Reliability-based {{maintenance}} policies allow {{qualitative and}} quantitative evaluation of system downtimes via revealing main causes of breakdowns and discussing required preventive activities against failures. Application of preventive maintenance {{is especially important for}} mining machineries since production is highly affected from machinery breakdowns. Overburden stripping operations are one of the integral parts in surface coal mine productions. <b>Draglines</b> are extensively utilized in overburden stripping operations and they achieve earthmoving activities with bucket capacities up to 168 m 3. The massive structure and operational severity of these machines increase the importance of performance awareness for individual working components. Research on <b>draglines</b> is rarely observed in the literature and maintenance studies for these earthmovers have been generally ignored. On this basis, this paper offered a comprehensive reliability assessment for two <b>draglines</b> currently operating in the Tunçbilek coal mine and discussed preventive replacement for wear-out components of the <b>draglines</b> considering cost factors...|$|R
25|$|A real {{benefit of}} air cushion {{vehicles}} in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain, such as swamps, was overlooked by {{the excitement of the}} British Government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft. It was not until the early 1970s that the technology was used for moving a modular marine barge with a <b>dragline</b> on board for use over soft reclaimed land.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of the gland {{labelled}} 1 on Figure 1 is the secretory or tail section of the gland. The walls of this section are lined with cells that secrete proteins Spidroin I and Spidroin II, {{the main components of}} this spider's <b>dragline.</b> These proteins are found in the form of droplets that gradually elongate to form long channels {{along the length of the}} final fibre, hypothesised to assist in preventing crack formation or even self-healing of the fibre.|$|E
25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a <b>dragline,</b> then springs onto the prey.|$|E

25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The <b>dragline</b> excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its completion bond. These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey to dewater in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, and it would take four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a <b>dragline</b> excavator to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E

When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Although Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent, he refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, <b>Dragline</b> refuses to continue the fight. Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws {{the attention of the}} guards. Later, Luke wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing. Luke comments that [...] "sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand", prompting <b>Dragline</b> to nickname him [...] "Cool Hand Luke".|$|E

Osgood's product line complemented Marion Power Shovel's, {{with most of}} Osgood's product line focusing on shovels, cranes and <b>draglines</b> that were small capacity machines as opposed to Marion's line, which focused increasingly on high end strip mining <b>draglines.</b> Osgood also built road-ready mobile units that used Mack truck undercarriages.|$|R
40|$|Male Schizocosa ocreata wolf spiders court females using {{displays}} {{that involve}} dramatic waving motions of their ornamented forelegs. In nature males are often found missing one, and sometimes both, of these legs. We here find that, {{when exposed to}} female <b>draglines,</b> males missing these signalling appendages perform a high intensity courtship element ('jerky tapping') at a greater rate than intact males. Loss of forelegs were associated with changes in chemoexploration activity, tendency to stand stationary, and performance of a low intensity courtship element ('tapping'). The age of the virgin female from which <b>draglines</b> were collected also had an important influence on male courtship behaviour; males on the <b>draglines</b> of old females {{were less likely to}} court and if, they did court, did so at a lower rate. These data indicate that courtship behaviour of male S. ocreata is flexible, varying both with the state of the male himself and the state of the female whose <b>draglines</b> he has encountered. Such individual courtship flexibility raises challenging questions of what processes and trade-offs underlie male courtship decision-making, and whether autotomy-induced changes in courtship activity represent adaptive compensation. 11 page(s...|$|R

500|$|Seemingly broken, {{and again}} {{working on the}} chain gang, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the {{disappointed}} prisoners, he runs {{to one of the}} trucks to take Boss Godfrey's rifle to him. After Boss Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle to the truck. He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] In the excitement of the moment, <b>Dragline</b> jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells <b>Dragline</b> that they should part ways. <b>Dragline</b> agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. <b>Dragline</b> walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks to a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. <b>Dragline</b> carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, <b>Dragline</b> implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim. As the captain's car drives away, it crushes Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, <b>Dragline</b> and the other prisoners reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. <b>Dragline</b> is now wearing leg irons, and there is a new Walking Boss.
