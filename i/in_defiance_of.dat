5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} {{religious convictions}} {{have been much}} debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> a key Protestant belief.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{was free}} of the sectarianism that marked the rivalry between Glasgow's two leading teams. His close friends {{included}} the Celtic players Billy McNeill, Pat Crerand and Mike Jackson, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the unwritten rule that rivals did not associate.|$|E
5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to Palestine, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the British blockade of the territory.|$|E

60|$|Some men in {{this mess}} {{would have tried to}} set {{themselves}} right with the world. But to give in, even when he was wrong, and had all society against him, was not the way of the Honourable John. He had kept the Diamond, <b>in</b> flat <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> assassination, <b>in</b> India. He kept the Diamond, <b>in</b> flat <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> public opinion, <b>in</b> England. There you have the portrait of the man before you, as in a picture: a character that braved everything; and a face, handsome as it was, that looked possessed by the devil.|$|R
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Marie becomes {{smitten with}} her target. <b>In</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Corentin and the Chouans whom she detests, she devises {{a plan to}} marry the Chouan leader. Fooled by Corentin into believing that Montauran loves her mortal enemy Madame du Gua, Marie orders Hulot to destroy the rebels. She discovers her folly too late and tries, unsuccessfully, to save her husband the day after their marriage.|$|E
5000|$|He {{worked at}} Merck & Co., Inc. from 1927 to 1948. In 1950, he {{successfully}} persuaded Congress to assist Josip Broz Tito <b>in</b> his <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Stalin regime.|$|R
5000|$|Since the Vietnam War era, U.S. Air Force {{members have}} participated in Mustache March, where Airmen grow moustaches <b>in</b> good-natured <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> facial hair {{regulations}} {{during the month of}} March.|$|R

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta {{appointed}} new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E

60|$|Therefore, when--as if <b>in</b> placid <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Pompadour's challenge--Lord Eglinton {{handed the}} Duke of Cumberland's letter silently {{back to the}} King, the latter slipped it into his pocket with a gesture of ostentatious indifference.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, a {{group of}} twelve Orthodox priests {{representing}} five different national churches, some <b>in</b> open <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> directives from their church leadership, issued a ten-page declaration calling for the removal all liturgical passages they perceived as anti-Semitic.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth {{faced her}} most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
50|$|Osborne {{seems to}} have been curiously untroubled by his {{official}} censure. He was prepared to act <b>in</b> open <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the royal command, and as late as 1692 Protestant landowners were still complaining of being harassed by him.|$|R
50|$|The {{image of}} a user-created path, <b>in</b> seeming <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> authority, across the earth between the concrete, has {{captured}} the imagination of many as a metaphor for, variously, anarchism, intuitable design, individual creativity, or the wisdom of crowds.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Giannina Braschi {{began writing}} {{dramatic}} dialogues in English, Spanish, and Spanglish. Her bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing! (AmazonCrossing) is experimental in format and radical <b>in</b> its <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> English-only laws, ethnic cleansing campaigns, and the corporate censorship.|$|R
5|$|Pellew {{ordered his}} ships to give chase, as Thévenard fled towards the French coast before the British {{numerical}} supremacy. One British ship was {{faster than the}} others, the 38-gun HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle cutting Révolutionnaire off from the shore and bringing the larger French ship to action. For 45 minutes Artois battled Révolutionnaire until support arrived, {{at which point the}} French frigate's crew surrendered their ship <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> their captain's orders. Casualties and damage were light on both sides, and Révolutionnaire was rapidly commissioned into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron that had captured her and subsequently capturing the French frigate Unité at the Action of 13 April 1796.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> {{the federal government and}} the AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} fell briefly under British rule {{during the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable {{things from the}} half-built parish. <b>In</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city. As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders {{did not attempt to}} enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort. The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of the blockade and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
