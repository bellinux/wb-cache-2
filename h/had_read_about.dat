On one occasion, the then station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters {{and asked him to}} confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.|$|E

His father, William Henry Bragg, was Elder Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Adelaide.

His father, who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Röntgen's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Solum was {{selected}} as director based on the producers' experience with him from Carl Gustav, gjengen og parkeringsbandittene. The producers took more artistic decisions than was common at the time; for instance, they felt that Solum's choice of composer was wrong. During this discussion, the team was contacted by Geir Bøhren and Bent Åserud, who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the plans the newspaper, and sent a music sample to the team. Thus the duo became {{the first choice of}} both the director and the producers. Tristan DeVere Cole acted as an assistant director in addition to directing the English scenes.|$|E

25|$|Watts {{spent several}} {{holidays}} in France in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It {{was not long}} afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the Anglican Christianity he {{had been exposed to}} and the Buddhism he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which had been established by Theosophists, and was now run by the barrister Christmas Humphreys. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.|$|E

The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches, and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s, PSFS had the most depositors of any savings bank in the United States; it was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children to put money into savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS.|$|E

You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass {{dedicated}} to his father, William, {{who had died}} in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had {{been a part of the}} composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.|$|E

Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes, and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in a copy of Gardner's novel High Magic's Aid that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953. Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven.

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Ebony and Jet magazines, Jackson {{said that he}} had gotten the idea for the song from a true story that he <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in Time or Newsweek magazine. Jackson stated that the story said that a student that went to school in upstate New York, who was [...] "from the ghetto", had tried to make something of his life and planned to leave all of his friends behind when he returned from Thanksgiving break. He added that the student's friends' jealousy resulted in them killing the student; Jackson stated that the student's death {{was not included in the}} music video. The only case that fits these details is that of Edmund Perry. However, Perry was not killed by kids in his neighborhood; he was killed by a plainclothes police officer when Perry and his brother allegedly attacked and badly beat the officer in a mugging attempt.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's You Asked For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by freelancer Dan Vebber, though The Simpsons {{executive}} producer Matt Selman received the idea for it.

In addition, the episode {{was inspired by the}} Ocean's Trilogy, a film series about a group of criminals that heist casinos, and features many elements from it. Actor Andy García, who appears in that series as a casino owner, guest starred in [...] "The Book Job" [...] as the book publishing executive. It also contains several references to and parodies of the Harry Potter and Twilight series, aimed at young adults. The episode was seen by approximately 5.77 million people during its original airing and since then it has received positive reviews from television critics, particularly for its satire of the book publishing industry and for its references to the Ocean's Trilogy. Gaiman, who provided his voice for the episode, has also been praised for his performance.|$|E
