40|$|This article uses multi-period ex ante anticipations {{of money}} supply growth to {{estimate}} the parameters of a model, suggested by Stanley Fischer, in which money affects real variables only through multi-period errors <b>in</b> <b>anticipations.</b> This model is tested against an alternative, first evaluated empirically by Robert Barro, in which money affects real variables only through single period errors <b>in</b> <b>anticipations.</b> The two models are compared using the "P" test procedure for non-nested models suggested by Davidson and MacKinnon. The small sample properties of the test are unknown. Random experiments are performed to approximate these properties. On the basis of estimated small scale distributions, the Fischer model rejects the Barro model at conventional levels, but is not rejected by it.

30|$|Projects tend {{to exceed}} planned {{timelines}} and budgets. One {{reason may be}} that potential project risks are insufficiently reflected <b>in</b> <b>anticipations</b> of project success. Furthermore, project managers’ overconfidence may lead them to assess risk in a biased manner. The present study examines how risk assessment relates to overall anticipated project success and how overconfidence on the part of project managers influences such assessments. We assume that project managers’ risk awareness serves as a mediator between overconfidence and risk assessment. To observe the planning behavior of 204 project managers, we used a standardized, case-based survey. The results show that overconfidence reduces risk awareness among project managers, leading them to assess risks more optimistically and come to more positive conclusions about anticipated project success. When judging project success, project managers only consider the probability of a risk occurring; they do not factor in the impact of said risks on project success should the risks arise. Risks thus seem to be insufficiently reflected <b>in</b> <b>anticipations</b> of project success which might be a reason for high failure rates of projects.|$|R
