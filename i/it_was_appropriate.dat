5|$|Common Sense Media gave {{it three}} stars {{out of five}} and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> for grade-school {{children}} but that some violent scenes were inadvisable for younger viewers. A second Famitsu review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, {{it became}} one of the first {{universities}} in the Philippines to require the use of English as a medium of instruction, to replace Spanish. When <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to Filipinize the administration, Fr. Leonardo Z. Legazpi, O.P. became the first Filipino Rector of UST on October 9, 1971.|$|E

5000|$|The term midwife looks superficially to <b>be</b> {{feminine}} (since <b>it</b> {{ends with}} -wife), but etymologically <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> to use <b>it</b> {{to refer to}} someone of either gender; the term comes from an Old English term meaning [...] "with the woman".

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not be done in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E

5|$|Michael Eisner, then CEO, and Roy E. Disney, Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, felt Who Framed Roger Rabbit was too risqué {{with sexual}} references. Eisner and Zemeckis {{disagreed}} over various {{elements of the}} film, but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner.|$|E
5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E
5|$|The Third Fleet sailed from Ulithi on 30 December 1944. On 3 and 4 January its {{aircraft}} carriers struck Japanese airfields on Formosa, Okinawa and nearby islands {{in an attempt}} to prevent them from being used to attack the Allied forces at Lingayen Gulf. In addition, its strike aircraft attacked Japanese shipping at Formosa, sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four frigates. Acting on a request from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the South West Pacific Area, the fleet struck airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January. At around this time Vice-Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Seventh Fleet which was responsible for the Lingayen Gulf landings, asked Halsey to operate west of Luzon to provide air cover during the initial period of the invasion. Halsey did not believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> for his force to operate in such a passive role, and instead ordered further strikes on the Japanese airfields in southern Formosa which posed the greatest threat to Kinkaid's command. These took place on 9 January. During the morning of 9 January, Nimitz released the Third Fleet from directly covering the Lingayen Gulf area, and authorized it to enter the South China Sea. Once all the strike aircraft had landed that afternoon Halsey issued orders to execute the planned attack into the South China Sea. During the fleet's operations from 3 to 9 January it destroyed more than 150 Japanese aircraft, but lost 86 of its own, including 46 in accidents.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} points, the Court {{found that a}} {{judicial}} review of the type brought by the Government against the railroads did not require a three-judge panel to make a ruling; rather, a single judge was the most appropriate course. In accordance with the other points the Court adopted, it declared that, because the District Court did not hear the case based {{on the merits of}} the complaint, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to reverse the decision of the lower court and remand the case back for such judgment.|$|E

Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, DA Ferman charged Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane for her alleged {{involvement}} in the leaking of confidential investigative information to a newspaper and for her subsequent attempts to cover up these actions. Following the leak, a grand jury investigated and recommended the arrest and filing of criminal charges against Kane for felony perjury and multiple misdemeanors nine months prior to her being charged. However, Ferman launched her own independent criminal investigation into the allegations against Kane. Ultimately DA Ferman concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to file criminal charges against the Attorney General. Kane's criminal trial for felony charges of perjury and obstruction began on August 8, 2016. On August 15, she was convicted on all nine counts.|$|E
25|$|A {{relationship}} between Colin and Barry was quickly developed and {{the residents of}} Albert Square gossiped in hushed voices about {{the true nature of}} their friendship. In 1987 EastEnders was responsible for screening the first ever gay kiss in a UK soap opera, much to the outrage of the viewing public. A small kiss on the forehead, given to Barry from Colin, received a record number of complaints from angry viewers. In addition, the right-wing British press reacted with fury. They began a smear campaign, branding the programme 'filth' and, for a while, dubbed the show EastBenders. There were even questions in parliament about whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to have gay men in a family show when AIDS was sweeping the country.|$|E
25|$|The 2016 Shoreham Airshow was cancelled. The organisers {{added that}} the {{possibility}} of a 2017 airshow would be explored when and if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> to do so. In January 2017, it was announced that the 2017 Shoreham Airshow would not take place. Doubt was expressed about an airshow taking place at Shoreham in 2018. The 2016 Llandudno Airshow was cancelled, {{due to a lack of}} time to make changes in light of new regulations introduced by the CAA. The organisers intend that the 2017 airshow will go ahead. For the 2016 Farnborough Airshow, the Red Arrows performed a flypast rather than an aerobatic display, stating that the latter would not be appropriate in the aftermath of the Shoreham accident.|$|E
