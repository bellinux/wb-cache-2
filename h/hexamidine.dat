40|$|The first medical cure of Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} {{was obtained}} by use of propamidine isethionate. Since then, {{it has been the}} basic drug recommended for use in treatment. Because some Acanthamoeba strains have been reported to be resistant to propamidine and propamidine was found to be only weakly cysticidal, superior homologs such as butamidine, pentamidine, <b>hexamidine,</b> heptamidine, octamidine, and nonamidine were tested for their amoebicidal effects on two Acanthamoeba strains isolated from patients with keratitis. Trophozoicidal and cysticidal efficiencies were found to be increased from propamidine to nonamidine; i,e,, when the alkyl chain connecting the two benzene rings in their molecular structures was elongated, in comparison with propamidine, <b>hexamidine</b> and octamidine were the most amoebicidal molecules. As a result of these data, a kinetic study carried out on propamidine, <b>hexamidine,</b> and octamidine demonstrated that the amoebicidal effects resulted from two events: the diffusion of molecules through the plasma membrane or the double wall of trophozoites or cysts, respectively, and the lethal effects of molecules on amoebic protoplasm. The diffusion kinetics were increased when the alkyl chain was elongated, i. e., with an increase in the lipophilic properties of molecules, In contrast, the lethal effect kinetics were found to be unchanged by this elongation, indicating that they originated from the cationic surface-active properties induced by the protonated amidine groups attached to each benzene ring, which themselves remained unchanged from one molecule to the other. These results strongly advocate the immediate replacement of propamidine by <b>hexamidine</b> in the medical treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis; in France, 0. 1 % <b>hexamidine</b> eyedrops are available (Desomedine). The results also advocate clinical investigations on the efficiency and toxicity of octamidine, which appears to be the most amoebicidal diamidine in vitro...|$|E

In our series, {{we did not observe}} postoperative infection, although we acknowledge that abdominal irrigation {{at the end of the}} operation may be sufficient to avoid abdominal infection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{present a}} series of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis in 24 eyes. Methods: Retrospective non-comparative {{observational}} case series. Medical records were retrieved and individuals evaluated based on symptoms, risk factors, visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy and pathological examination of cornea epithelial scrapings. Demographic features, clinical course, predisposing factors, microbiological profile, treatment, final clinical outcome and visual acuity were recorded. Results: Of the 22 patients, 90. 9 % were men, {{with a mean age}} of 30. 3 years (range 15 – 76 years). Two (9. 1 %) had bilateral involvement, 15 (68. 2 %) were non-contact lens users, 17 (77. 3 %) reported contamination with mud within 2 weeks (mean 6. 8 days) of onset of symptoms. All patients presented with conjunctivitis and coarse, multifocal, punctate epithelial keratitis. Two out of 24 eyes (8. 3 %) had anterior stromal infiltrates, while 8 (33. 3 %) had anterior uveitis. Microsporidial spores were identified on modified trichrome staining of corneal epithelial scrapes in all eyes. All eyes were treated with epithelial debridement, topical fluoroquinolone and <b>hexamidine</b> diisethionate, 7 (31. 8 %) patients received oral albendazole, and all eyes with anterior uveitis received topical steroids. All cases resolved without visually significant sequelae. Conclusion: Microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis occurred mainly in males, is usually unilateral, presents as conjunctivitis and coarse, multifocal, punctate epithelial keratitis, and may incite anterior uveitis. Soil contamination is an important risk factor. Treatment with debridement, fluoroquinolones, <b>hexamidine</b> diisethionate with or without systemic albendazole is effective, with steroids reserved for any associated anterior uveitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{free-living}} amoeba (FLA) Acanthamoeba sp. is an opportunistic pathogen {{that can}} cause amoebic keratitis (AK) or granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). While current treatments of AK are long with some relapses, no consensus therapy has been developed for GAE remaining lethal in 90 % of the cases. In this context, efficient antiacanthamoebal drugs have to be identified. In this work, 15 drugs used {{in the treatment of}} AK or GAE or in other parasitic diseases were evaluated for their inÂ vitro activity on A. Â castellanii. <b>Hexamidine,</b> voriconazole and clotrimazole exhibited the highest activities with IC 50 values at 0. 05 Â Î¼M, 0. 40 Â Î¼M and 0. 80 Â Î¼M, respectively, while rifampicin, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole were inactive. Among 15 drug associations evaluated, no synergistic effect was observed, and one antagonism was determined between <b>hexamidine</b> and chlorhexidine. Interestingly, amphotericin B was the only drug presenting an increase of IC 50 as a function of treatment duration. The amoebae susceptibility to amphotericin B cultured in the presence of 250 Â Î¼M of the drug was similar to the one of a naive control, revealing that no resistant strain could be selected. However, the amoebae susceptibility always returned to an initial level at each passage. This natural and non-acquired adaptation to amphotericin B, qualified as resilience, was observed in several strains of A. Â castellanii and A. Â polyphaga. Using a pharmacological approach with effectors of different cellular mechanisms or transports, and an ultrastructural analysis of amphotericin B-treated amoebae, the involvement of several mitochondria-dependent pathways as well as multidrug resistant transporters was determined in amphotericin B resilience. Based on the observations from this study, the relevance of using amphotericin B in GAE treatments may be reconsidered, while the use of some other drugs, such as rifampicin or cotrimoxazole, is not relative to intrinsic antiacanthamoebal activity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{antiseptic}} and disinfectant {{potential of}} a formulation containing the tamoxifen analogue 1, 1 -bis[4 -(3 -dimethylaminopropoxy) phenyl]- 2 -ferrocenyl-but- 1 -ene citrate was assessed according to European standards and pharmacopeia in comparison with a commercial antiseptic product containing <b>hexamidine</b> diisethionate, chlorhexidine digluconate and chlorocresol as active ingredients. The formulation met the phase 1 requirement of reducing by 5 cycles the counts of microorganisms frequently involved in healthcare-associated infections, namely Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 10541 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. It also killed a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii which is highly resistant to antibiotics and antiseptics. In phase 2 /step 2 tests, it reduced the counts of E. coli ATCC 10536 by 4 log cycles within 60 seconds on hands (standard EN 1499). The novel formula is a potent biocide, and this demonstration {{could lead to the}} development of a new commercial antiseptic...|$|E
40|$|Aim of our {{paper is}} to present a case of painless Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} in a soft contact lens wearer. A 17 -year-old male, highly myopic, prolonged soft contact lens wearer, presented to us with painless red watery right eye having remarkably diminished vision. Last six weeks he was treated elsewhere for the microbial keratitis with no improvement. No pain was reported and on the direct questionnaire about it he denied it. There was marked mixed conjunctival and ciliary injection. A central stromal opacity with a pronounced surrounding corneal ring of inflammatory infiltration and epithelial defect was seen on biomicroscopy of the right eye. Circular pannus was already formed reaching epithelial defect overlying corneal ring infiltrate. Acanthamoeba spp in the corneal sample was confirmed. Prolonged therapy with 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate solution combined with 0. 1 % <b>hexamidine</b> solution resulted in corneal healing left with a large central dense stromal opacity with circular pannus reaching peripheral third of the cornea but with very thin blood vessels and the best corrected visual acuity of 0. 1 tested on Snellen chart. In conclusion, even in a lack of typical symptom for Acanthamoeba keratitis such as pain, this amoeba should be ruled out especially in a soft contact lens wearer...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{sequences}} {{targeted by}} a complete homologous series of aromatic diamidines have been determined at single-nucleotide resolution via protection from cutting by the endonucleases DNase I, DNase II and micrococcal nuclease. Propamidine, pentamidine {{and to a}} lesser extent <b>hexamidine</b> bind selectively to nucleotide sequences composed of at least four consecutive A-T base pairs. In contrast, the binding to DNA of butamidine, heptamidine, octamidine and nonamidine is poorly sequence-selective. Sequences composed of only three consecutive A-T base pairs do not afford a potential binding site for propamidine or the longer homologues, and none of the drugs tolerate the presence of a G-C base pair within the binding site. Experiments with DNA molecules containing inosine in place of guanosine and 2, 6 -diaminopurine in place of adenine reveal that the lack of binding of propamidine to GC-containing sites is attributable to an obstructive effect of the exocyclic 2 -amino group of guanosine. The present data support the view that the local conformation of the double helix (in particular the width of the minor groove) plays a dominant role in the binding reaction and that the capacity of diamidines to recognize AT-rich sequences selectively varies considerably depending on the length of the alkyl chain. The evidence indicates that binding to AT-tracts in DNA must play a role in the biological activity of these diamidines, but there is no simple correlation between binding and pharmacological efficacy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUse of {{antiseptics}} and disinfectants {{is essential}} in infection control practices in hospital and other healthcare settings. In this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (Cx 1), has been evaluated in comparison with <b>hexamidine</b> (HX) and chlorhexidine (CHX), two older cationic antiseptics. The MICs for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (with or without mecA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae producing various β-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. Cx 1 showed similar activity against S. aureus, CoNS and Enterococcus spp., irrespective {{of the presence of}} mecA or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against CoNS (MIC < 1 mg/L). Variable activities were observed against Enterobacteriaceae; the MICs determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (MICs of 2, 8 and 64 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [Extended Spectrum β-Lactase (ESBLs) or other β-lactamases; overproduction of AmpC]. Poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. CHX appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. HX showed a lower activity, essentially against Gram-positive strains. Consequently, the differences observed with respect to Cx 1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e. g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. These results raise the possibility that Cx 1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than CHX...|$|E
