5000|$|Joseph Archibald, Curator of the Warrnambool Museum, made strenuous {{efforts to}} {{document}} accounts and stimulate local {{interest in the}} wreck in the early 1890s. In June 1890, Archibald led the first organised search for the wreck. In July, former whaler Hugh Donnelly led another search, using bearings Captain John Mills was alleged to have given a friend. In November, the Victorian Government sponsored another search. In 1891, Archibald delivered a paper entitled [...] "Ancient Wreck at Warrnambool," [...] to the Royal Geographical Society, and this appears to {{mark the end of}} his active involvement. In 1910, having conducted further research, George Gordon McCrae also delivered a paper to the Geographical Society. Further searches have been conducted since the 1980s, coinciding with the publication of Kenneth McIntyre's book and the Mahogany Ship symposia, conducted in nearby Warrnambool. These were conducted with the support of local authorities, businesses and volunteer organisations such as the National Trust. To date, however, nothing has been found to verify the popular Portuguese theory. Analysis of a number of artefacts alleged to be from the wreck were discussed by Rev. John Pinson in 1987. These include a ruler and two penholders, supposedly made from timber of the wreck. In both cases the wood has been identified as native to northern New South Wales or Queensland. A fragment of wood from the collection of Joseph Archibald, held by the National Library, Canberra has been identified as eucalyptus. An unusual amphora found on the beach in 1943 has been identified as of nineteenth century North African origin. In 2000, a two-metre length of <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> was uncovered in the sand dunes. However, its shape and state indicated it was probably part of a shipment of white oak being carried on the sailing vessel Falls of Halladale, which was wrecked at Peterborough in the early twentieth century.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. robur) {{have long}} puzzled plant {{biologists}} owing to disputed species differentiation. Extensive hybridization or shared ancestry {{have been proposed}} as alternative hypotheses to explain why genetic differentiation between these oak species is low. Species delimitation is usually weak and often shows gradual transitions in leaf morphology. Hence, individual identification may be difficult, but remains a critical step for both scientific work and practical management. Methods Multilocus genotype data (five nuclear microsatellites) were used from ten Swiss oak stands for taxon identification without a priori grouping of individuals or populations, using model-based Bayesian assignment tests. Key Results Three groups best structured the data, indicating that the taxonomical signal was stronger than the spatial signal. Most individuals showed high posterior probabilities for either of three genetic groups that were best circumscribed as taxonomical units. The assignment of a subset of trees, whose taxonomic status had been previously characterized in detail, supported this classification scheme. Conclusions Molecular-genetic assignment tests are useful {{in the identification of}} species status in critical taxon complexes such as the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks.</b> Such an approach is of practical importance for forest management, e. g. for stand certification or in seed trade to trace the origin of forest product...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract• Key messageWe {{show that}} joint multivariate {{analyses}} of leaf morphological characters and molecular-genetic markers improve the taxonomic assignment in hybridizing <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks.</b> However, model-based approaches using genetic data alone represent straightforward alternatives to laborious, detailed morphological assessments. • ContextIn <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks,</b> species delimitation is debated because of large overlap of morphological characteristics {{likely due to}} hybridization. • AimsWe tested whether joint multivariate analyses of leaf morphology and molecular markers improve the identification of three oak species (Quercus petraea, Quercus pubescens, Quercus robur) compared to approaches using morphological or genetic variables only. • MethodsWe assessed 13 leaf morphological characters and applied eight nuclear microsatellite markers in almost 1400 trees of 71 oak populations across Switzerland. We performed two multivariate approaches with three variable sets (morphology, genetics, combined) and assessed their performance in separating the taxa. We also compared the taxon assignment to a model-based clustering approach (Structure) based on genetic data alone. • ResultsA joint use of morphological and genetic variables led to an improved taxon assignment. Whereas Q. robur could clearly {{be separated from the}} two other taxa, there was a certain overlap between Q. petraea and Q. pubescens. The Structure clustering led to the same taxon assignment in 85  % of the individuals. • ConclusionIt is important to consider both morphological and genetic properties in morphologically similar and hybridizing species. However, it might be more efficient to concentrate only on genetic markers than on time-consuming morphological assessments...|$|R
30|$|Dispersal and vicariance are {{the main}} biogeographic factors that {{contribute}} to species distribution (Donoghue et al. 2001; Manos and Stanford 2001). Quaternary glacial cycles that caused topographic changes and climatic fluctuations should have affected the distribution of species by both dispersal and vicariance (Hewitt 2004). For example, the well-known retreat of <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks</b> into the southern refugia during glacial periods and their interglacial northward expansion explains the reshuffling of species distribution (Petit et al. 2002 a, b). In Southeast Asia, the emergence of ancient Sundaland, the former continent connecting the Thai-Malay peninsula to Borneo and the Philippine archipelagos, was suggested as a land bridge for species dispersal between Indochina and the Malay Archipelago, but the submergence of the Sunda shelf was the prime barrier for vicariant events between the Malay Archipelago and continental Asia (Lohman et al. 2011). Glacially-dependent demographic changes leading to genetic differentiation of populations were also reported for several eastern and Southeast Asian land plants, such as Ceriops tagal (Rhizophoraceae) (Liao et al. 2011), Castanopsis carlesii (Fagaceae) (Cheng et al. 2005), Dysosma versipellis (Berberidaceae) (Fu et al. 2009), Machilus spp. (Lauraceae) (Wu et al. 2006), and Pinus massoniana (Pinaceae) (Ge et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Historical {{trajectories of}} tree species {{during the late}} Quaternary have been well reconstructed through genetic and palaeobotanical studies. However, many congeneric tree species are interfertile, and the timing and {{contribution}} of introgression to species divergence during their evolutionary history remains largely unknown. *We quantified past and current gene flow events between four morphologically divergent oak species (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Q. pyrenaica, Q. pubescens), by two independent inference methods: diffusion approximation to the joint frequency spectrum (∂a∂i) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). For each pair of species, alternative scenarios of speciation allowing gene flow over different timescales were evaluated. *Analyses of 3524 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly distributed in the genome, showed that these species evolved in complete isolation {{for most of their}} history, but recently came into secondary contact, probably facilitated by the most recent period of postglacial warming. *We demonstrated that: there was sufficient genetic differentiation before secondary contact for the accumulation of barriers to gene flow; and current <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> genomes are a mosaic of genes that have crossed species boundaries and genes impermeable to gene flow...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{resources}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in combating the adverse {{effects of climate change}} and invasive pathogens on forest species. Efforts to breed a blight-resistant American chestnut are spearheaded by these new resources. Like the American chestnut once was, red oaks (Quercus section Lobatae) are economically and ecologically important to eastern North America. Identifying genomic regions associated with adaptive traits is an important step in breeding better oaks. To this end, the current study utilized resources previously developed in <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> species pedunculate oak and sessile oak to better identify the genetic basis of adaptive traits. A northern red oak mapping population was created by grafting replicates of full-sibling (same parents) seedlings. A subset of the population was surveyed for various adaptive traits including bud burst date, leaf morphology, stomatal density and winter leaf retention (marcescence). Three genomic regions, or quantitative trait loci, associated with bud burst date were identified in the population. Two of these regions were similar to those identified in pedunculate oak. Additionally, winter leaf retention was discovered to likely be associated with growing season length. These results suggest that oaks growing later into the season are more likely to retain dead foliage. This study illuminates a level of similarity in significant associations between genome and trait between two oak sections, and provides new information on a scarcely-studied trait...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhylogeography {{allows the}} {{inference}} of evolutionary processes {{that have shaped}} the current distribution of genealogical lineages across a landscape. In this perspective, comparative phylogeographical analyses are useful in detecting common historical patterns by either comparing different species within the same area within a continent or by comparing similar species in different areas. Here, we analyse one taxon (the white oak, genus Quercus, subgenus Quercus, section Quercus) that is widespread worldwide, and we evaluate its phylogeographical pattern on two different continents: western North America and Western Europe. The goals {{of the present study}} are: (i) to compare the chloroplast genetic diversity found in one California oak species vs. that found in the extensively studied European oak species (in France and the Iberian Peninsula); (ii) to contrast the geographical structure of haplotypes between these two taxa and test for a phylogeographical structure for the California species. For this purpose, we used the same six maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and a similar sampling strategy. The haplotype diversity within site as well as the differentiation among sites was alike in both taxa, but the Californian species has higher allelic richness with a greater number of haplotypes (39 vs. 11 in the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> complex). Furthermore, in California these 39 haplotypes are distributed locally in patches while in the European oaks haplotypes are distributed into lineages partitioned longitudinally. These contrasted patterns could indicate that gene movement in California oak populations have been more stable in response to past climatic and geological events, in contrast to their European counterparts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew {{methods for}} better {{identification}} of timber geographical origin would constitute an important technical {{element in the}} forest industry, for phytosanitary certification procedures or {{in the chain of}} custody developed for the certification of timber from sustainably managed forests. In the case of the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks,</b> a detailed reference map of chloroplast (cp) DNA variation across the range exists, and we propose here to use the strong geographical structure, characterized by a differentiation of western vs. eastern populations, for the purpose of oak wood traceability. We first developed cpDNA markers permitting the characterization of haplotype on degraded DNA obtained from wood samples. The techniques were subsequently validated by confirming the full correspondence between genotypes obtained from living tissues (buds) and from wood collected from the same individual oak. Finally, a statistical procedure was used to test if the haplotype composition of a lot of wood samples is consistent with its presumed geographical origin. Clearly, the technique cannot permit the unambiguous identification of wood products of unknown origin but can be used to check the conformity of genetic composition of wood samples with the region of alleged origin. This could lead to major applications not only in the forest industry but also in archaeology or in palaeobotany...|$|R
40|$|A {{consortium}} of 16 laboratories have studied chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oaks.</b> A common strategy for molecular screening, based on restriction analysis of four PCR-amplified cpDNA fragments, {{was used to}} allow comparison among the different laboratories. A total of 2613 oak populations (12, 214 individual trees from eight species) were sampled from 37 countries, and analysed with the four fragments. They belong to eight related oak species: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. frainetto, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. canariensis and Q. macranthera. During this survey, 45 chloroplast variants were detected and are described together with their phylogenetic relationships, but several of these haplotypes were pooled when there were some risks of confusion across laboratories during the survey, and finally 32 remained that were mapped and used in diversity analyses. A strong phylogeographic structure is apparent from the data, where related haplotypes have broadly similar geographic distributions. In total, six cpDNA lineages are identified, which have distinct geographic distributions, mainly along a longitudinal gradient. Most haplotypes found in northern Europe are also present in the south, whereas the converse is not true, suggesting {{that the majority of}} mutations observed were generated prior to postglacial recolonisation, corroborating the conclusions of earlier studies. The description of a new western European lineage constitutes a major finding, compared to earlier phylogenetic treatments. Although the eight oak species studied systematically share cpDNA variants when in sympatry, they partition cpDNA diversity differently, as a consequence of their different ecology and life history attributes. Regional differences in levels of differentiation also exist (either species-specific or general); these seem {{to be related to the}} intensity of past and present management of the forests across Europe but also to the level of fragmentation of the range within these regions...|$|R

40|$|Waterlogging causes {{stressful}} {{conditions for}} perennial species. The temporary overabundance {{of water in}} waterlogged soil can induce hypoxia in the rhizosphere, leading to root death, tree decline and even dieback. Two closely related members of the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> complex, pedunculate (Quercus robur L.) and sessile (Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl.) oaks, have different ecological characteristics, especially regarding their adaptation to soil waterlogging. The tolerance of waterlogging observed in pedunculate oak is driven principally by its ability to produce adaptive structures, hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots, and to switch rapidly its metabolism to the fermentative pathway. This study had two objectives: (i) to identify genes important for adaptation to waterlogging and (ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in hypertrophied lenticel formation in pedunculate oak. We subjected seedlings of the two species to hypoxia by maintaining the water level 2  cm above the collar. The immersed part of the stem (i. e., containing hypertrophied lenticels in pedunculate oak) was sampled after 9 days of waterlogging stress and its gene expression was investigated by RNA-seq. Genes displaying differential expression between the two species were identified with the DESeq R package and a false discovery rate of 0. 001. We found that 3705 contigs were differentially regulated between the two species. Twenty-two differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The suberin biosynthesis pathway {{was found to be}} upregulated in pedunculate oak, consistent with molecular mechanisms analogous to those operating in the radial oxygen loss barrier in waterlogging-tolerant species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Few studies {{address the}} issue of {{hybridization}} in a more than two-species context. The species-rich Quercus complex is one of the systems which can offer such an opportunity. To investigate the contemporary pattern of hybridization we sampled and genotyped 320 offspring from a natural mixed forest comprising four species of the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> complex: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto. Results A total of 165 offspring were assigned unambiguously to one of the pollen donors within the study plot. The minimum amount of effective pollen originating from outside the plot varied markedly among the seed parents, ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 87. The majority of the successful matings (64. 1 %) occurred between conspecific individuals indicating the existence of reproductive barriers between oak species. However, the isolation was not complete since we found strong evidence for both first-generation (8. 4 %) and later-generation hybrids (27. 5 %). Only two out of eight seed parents, belonging to Q. petraea and Q. robur, showed a high propensity to hybridize with Q. pubescens and Q. petraea, respectively. Significant structure of the effective pollen pools (Φ pt = 0. 069, P = 0. 01) was detected in our sample. However, no support was found for the isolation by distance hypothesis. The proportion of hybrids was much higher (79 %) in the seed generation when compared to the adult tree generation. Conclusion First-generation hybrids were observed only between three out of six possible species combinations. Hybrids between one pair of species preferred to mate with one of their parental species. The observation of first and later-generation hybrids in higher frequency in acorns than in adults might be explained by selection against hybrid genotypes, the history of this uneven-aged forest or past introgression between species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{temperate}} regions, {{the time}} lag between vegetative bud burst and bud set determines {{the duration of}} the growing season of trees (i. e. the duration of wood biomass production). Dormancy, the period during which the plant is not growing, allows trees to avoid cold injury resulting from exposure to low temperatures. An understanding of the molecular machinery controlling the shift between these two phenological states is of key importance in the context of climatic change. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify genes upregulated during endo- and ecodormancy, the two main stages of bud dormancy. Sessile oak is a widely distributed <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>oak</b> species. A forcing test on young trees was first carried out to identify the period most likely to correspond to these two stages. Total RNA was then extracted from apical buds displaying endo- and ecodormancy. This RNA was used for the generation of cDNA libraries, and in-depth transcriptome characterization was performed with 454 FLX pyrosequencing technology. Results Pyrosequencing produced a total of 495, 915 reads. The data were cleaned, duplicated reads removed, and sequences were mapped onto the oak UniGene data. Digital gene expression analysis was performed, with both R statistics and the R-Bioconductor packages (edgeR and DESeq), on 6, 471 contigs with read numbers ≥ 5 within any contigs. The number of sequences displaying significant differences in expression level (read abundance) between endo- and ecodormancy conditions ranged from 75 to 161, depending on the algorithm used. 13 genes displaying significant differences between conditions were selected for further analysis, and 11 of these genes, including those for glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and dehydrin xero 2 (XERO 2) were validated by quantitative PCR. Conclusions The identification and functional annotation of differentially expressed genes involved in the “response to abscisic acid”, “response to cold stress” and “response to oxidative stress” categories constitutes a major step towards characterization of the molecular network underlying vegetative bud dormancy, an important life history trait of long-lived organisms...|$|E
