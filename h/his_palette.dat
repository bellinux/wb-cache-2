5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. <b>His</b> <b>palette</b> consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and {{showed no sign}} of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
50|$|He {{was known}} for <b>his</b> {{harmonious}} <b>palette,</b> exact drawing and compositional skills.|$|R
50|$|Costa {{maintains}} a ledger-size mood book in his studio. In early 2004 photographs of horses by Max Eastman appeared frequently in these volumes. Costa {{is inspired by}} the coats of horses, especially in <b>his</b> <b>palettes</b> of sepia and cream. The textures of his collection owe much to pony skin, alpaca, and leather. He enjoys photographs of Lauren Hutton and Charlotte Rampling from the 1970s, particularly ones which have them posed in close proximity with ponies and stallions. Costa said, These women are thoroughbreds.|$|R
5000|$|Magnus Colcord [...] "Rusty" [...] Heurlin (July 5, 1895March 10, 1986) was a Swedish-American artist {{best known}} for <b>his</b> pastel <b>palette</b> and depictions of Alaskan landscapes.|$|R
25|$|In later paintings, Kelly {{distilled}} <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> {{and introduced}} new forms. In each work, {{he started with}} a rectangular canvas which he carefully painted with many coats of white paint; a shaped canvas, mostly painted black, is placed on top.|$|E
25|$|In it, he is seen at work, holding <b>his</b> <b>palette,</b> brushes, and maulstick. The {{painting}} is notable for its monumentality {{and for an}} enigmatic background consisting of a shallow space with the fragments of two circles. It is the most ambitious self-portrait {{in which he is}} depicted at work and is considered a masterpiece of his last years.|$|E
25|$|Weston's {{sojourn in}} the Middle East proved {{to have a}} lasting impact on his work. The colors and light he {{witnessed}} there deeply affected <b>his</b> <b>palette.</b> Lacking paint, watercolor and paper, {{he was unable to}} capture the colors and light he saw and was reduced to writing about them in letters home. He produced only a handful of charcoal sketches from this period in his life.|$|E
50|$|His time in South of France {{would lead}} to a radical {{transformation}} in Lebasque’s paintings, changing <b>his</b> colour <b>palette</b> forever. Other travels included the Vendée, Normandy, and Brittany.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{his music}} shows the {{structural}} constraints analogous {{to the rules of}} Oulipo; familiar sounds from popular and everyday culture are also a regular feature of <b>his</b> music <b>palette.</b>|$|R
50|$|A solo {{exhibition}} in Tórshavn in 1961 broke new ground, showing {{for the first}} time a directly abstract perception of nature. The paintings had titles such as Kurpali (chaos, disorder) and Sjón í fuglaeyga (view through a bird's eye) This exhibition did not herald an instant conversion to non-figurative art - in the 1960s and well into the 1970s Ingálvur av Reyni treated landscape motifs as never before, although in a highly abstract way, especially the central theme of the village by the sea. <b>His</b> <b>palettes</b> vary from clear, powerful and glowing colours through a delicate greyish, anything but dry spectrum to the deep black register.|$|R
25|$|In July 1994, Tsvaygenbaum and {{his family}} left Russia because it had become very {{dangerous}} for his family to {{continue to live in}} the republic of Dagestan. Currently, he is a resident of Albany, New York. In the USA Tsvaygenbaum has continued to work with oil on canvas. His paintings continue to portray both universal and Jewish themes, but noticeably, <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> has shifted from browns to yellows.|$|E
25|$|After {{his arrival}} in England, where he was {{to spend the rest}} of his life, Alma-Tadema's career was one of {{continued}} success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major Pre-Raphaelite painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened <b>his</b> <b>palette,</b> varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork.|$|E
25|$|Raphael painted {{several of}} his works on wood support (Madonna of the Pinks) but he also used canvas (Sistine Madonna) and {{he was known to}} employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils. <b>His</b> <b>palette</b> was rich and he used almost all of the then {{available}} pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, verdigris and ochres. In {{several of his}} paintings (Ansidei Madonna) he even employed the rare brazilwood lake, metallic powdered gold and even less known metallic powdered bismuth.|$|E
50|$|Edward L. Loper Sr. (April 7, 1916 - October 11, 2011) was an African American {{artist and}} teacher from Delaware, {{best known for}} <b>his</b> vibrant <b>palette</b> and {{juxtaposition}} of colors. He taught painting for almost 70 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> musical <b>palette</b> tends toward {{large-scale}} works, {{mainly for}} orchestra or ensemble; {{he has also}} composed several smaller works for either solo instrument (In Memoriam: 8/17/99 for piano) or solo instrument and piano (Lines for clarinet and piano).|$|R
50|$|Segovia's {{contribution}} to the modern-romantic repertoire not only included commissions but also his own transcriptions of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive performances: <b>his</b> wide <b>palette</b> of tone, and his distinctive musical personality, phrasing and style.|$|R
25|$|Le Chahut is an oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring 170 by 141cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a Divisionist style, with pointillist dots of color. The work {{is dominated by}} a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of earth tones that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> prior to application on the canvas (any {{of which could be}} mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted {{around the edge of the}} canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.|$|E
25|$|Medović's {{work on the}} Pelješac {{peninsula}} {{marked a}} complete departure in technique and themes. He painted still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, which were new genres in Croatian art at the time. <b>His</b> <b>palette</b> became lighter and brighter as he worked outdoors: browns, greys and dull greens became purer, and were joined the purple of heather, the yellow of broom, and the rich array of blues of the sea. Abandoning his previously detailed style, his smaller studies from nature are more creative. With thick impasto and impulsive brush strokes, around 1907 a new style emerged in his work – pointillism in a light, bright colours, that he used for his landscapes of Pelješac. Initially (1908–1912), these were disciplined strokes on larger canvases, but in his later (1914–1918), smaller paintings with impressionistically captured motifs, the strokes became softer and more diffuse colours. He {{was one of the}} first Croatian artists to paint the coastal landscapes, and it dominated his work after the turn of the century.|$|E
25|$|The score has a slow {{opening and}} {{immediately}} provides a romantic sense of mystery. However, the music then launches into a quicker tempo, brass fanfares propelling the music {{along with a}} rhythmically incisive motif. An andante section for strings follows using a straightforward lilting rhythm. The simplicity of this section is a marked contrast to the next, marked vivace where the {{different parts of the}} orchestra compete with each other with an underlying consistent rhythmic drive. The following section is also manufactured of contrasts with lyrical strings followed by a solo clarinet and sparse accompaniment. High strings, harp (for the watery effect) and occasional percussion provide another contrasting orchestral sound, before the composer again re-assembles <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> of orchestral colours, using solo instruments in small groups, or alone, or high violins in long notes soaring above moving fragments of ideas below. The finale of Act 1 has an uneven rhythm with sudden accents darting about in Stravinskian fashion, the music being punctuated here and there by astringent wind chords.|$|E
5000|$|Described {{as having}} an [...] "idiosyncratic palette," [...] Thomson's control of colour was exceptional. [...] He often mixed {{available}} pigments to create unusual, new colours making <b>his</b> distinctive <b>palette</b> along with <b>his</b> brushwork instantly recognizable regardless of {{the subject of his}} work.|$|R
50|$|He {{has done}} thirty one solo shows and participates in group exhibitions.His landscapes and seascapes are not {{classical}} in style {{as the sea}} is just a motive for <b>his</b> colour <b>palette</b> while the shapes of his ships are more conceptual and impressionist than figurative.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his artistic talents, he was a craftsman who enjoyed making <b>his</b> own brushes, <b>palettes</b> and frames.|$|R
500|$|Ulysses S. Grant {{described}} Bennet Riley as [...] "the finest {{specimen of}} physical manhood I had ever looked upon...6'2 (190cm) in his stocking feet, straight as the undrawn [...] bowstring, broad shouldered with every limb in perfect proportion, with an eagle and a step {{as light as}} a forest tiger." [...] An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of <b>his</b> <b>palette,</b> and he spoke with a hoarse voice.|$|E
500|$|The {{enduring}} {{popularity of}} Tosca {{has not been}} matched by consistent critical enthusiasm. After the premiere, Ippolito Valetta of Nuova antologia wrote, [...] " [...] finds in <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> all colours, all shades; in his hands, the instrumental texture becomes completely supple, the gradations of sonority are innumerable, the blend unfailingly grateful to the ear." [...] However, one critic described act2 as overly long and wordy; another echoed Illica and Giacosa in stating that the rush of action did not permit enough lyricism, to the great detriment of the music. A third called the opera [...] "three hours of noise".|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{referred to}} it as being the band's best album in over 15 years. Alec Chillingworth of Stereoboard suggested that it saw Manson [...] "climbing back to the creative summit he fell from following Holy Wood." [...] He praised the record for its musical diversity, saying that [...] "by expanding <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> and finally getting it right, it reinstates Marilyn Manson as a relevant musical force, and an elder statesman of the industrial scene." [...] He awarded the album four out of five stars. Several other writers compared it to Mechanical Animals (1998). A writer for the blog Sonic Abuse said it was grander in scope than any of their albums since late 90s, and ranked it among the best releases of the band's discography.|$|E
50|$|Dallaire was {{technically}} a virtuoso in both {{painting and}} drawing.He painted on cardboard, canvas board, linen or cotton canvas, chipboard and plywood.Despite his studies, Dallaire was largely self-taught and was highly original.He {{paid little attention}} to external trends, while his style constantly evolved as he matured.His early work included realistic portraits, which were followed by cubist and surrealist works.All his work is characterized by a unique perception.Although interested in abstraction, he was essentially representative.His best known works are his paintings of festivities populated by unreal characters, glimpses of a mysterious private world.Despite <b>his</b> cheerful <b>palette,</b> <b>his</b> artificial paradise is peopled by troubled characters affected by fear, madness and violence.|$|R
5000|$|After his European travels, Sumbat used <b>his</b> {{newspaper}} <b>palette</b> as <b>his</b> canvas. With a few brush strokes, {{the random}} mix of gouache colors and printed letters came alive, suggesting a crowd {{in a traditional}} Iranian bazaar. In time, this technique, popularly known as [...] "Sumbatism", became one of Sumbat's signature styles.|$|R
25|$|Instrumentally, David Sinclair's fuzztone Hammond organ {{sound is}} a key {{ingredient}} of the early Caravan albums, and his playing is the dominant instrument on them. <b>His</b> musical <b>palette</b> subsequently expanded to include synthesizers. Jimmy Hastings' woodwind playing and orchestral arrangements have also been a regular feature in the band's music since its inception.|$|R
500|$|On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old {{daughter}} of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. [...] Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display {{a new sense of}} levity, while <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that [...] "the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Almost Blue" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Beckett, writing for Stylus Magazine, {{called it the}} [...] "biggest step" [...] that the singer took on Imperial Bedroom. He continued: [...] "It’s {{one of the strongest}} songs on the album. It has a haunting quality that had never been present in Costello’s work." [...] Imperial Bedroom was deemed one of the 100 best albums of all time by Rolling Stone. Douglas Wolk of Blender described it as one of the songs that every listener should [...] "download". Timothy and Elizabeth Bracy from Stereogum highlighted Emerick's contributions to the track in their article ranking Costello's albums [...] "from worst to best". James E. Perone, in his book [...] "The Words and Music of Elvis Costello", [...] cited [...] "Almost Blue" [...] along with two other songs from Imperial Bedroom as a [...] "demonstrat Costello's increasingly successful integration of balladry into <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> of vocal techniques".|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds and yellows and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though <b>his</b> <b>palette</b> was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this story out of where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y looks that didn’t feel right", before settling on tracksuits with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange tracksuits include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E
