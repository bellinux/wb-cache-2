500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told she had called him [...] "a young man with a dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} his retirement, in May 1964, Governor John J. McKeithen came to his office hoping that Middleton would accept a job on a {{commission}} that he was forming. The governor was wanting to ease the state's growing racial tensions by creating a biracial commission composed of 21 blacks and 21 whites. The governor needed a chairman who would command {{a tremendous amount of}} respect, and his choice was Middleton. Middleton said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for a year, beginning in 1965, but as had often happened in the past, the year stretched into five, and it wasn't until 1970 when the commission had reached its goals and was disbanded that Middleton was freed from this duty. [...] Middleton's black counterpart on the commission was Dr. Albert Dent, president of Dillard University in New Orleans, and the directors chosen to head the staff of this Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities were white attorney John Martzell and black attorney Jesse N. Stone. [...] Some of the potential trouble spots where the commission was able to have a positive effect included the towns of Ferriday and Opelousas, and the commission helped to open the ranks of the Louisiana State Police to qualified blacks. [...] The commission was disbanded in May 1970, after having effectively served its purpose, and the members each received a letter of thanks from the governor.|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section. Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday. The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can't sell a seven-foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent." [...] In his prime, Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted. Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain's previous record 78-point game, [...] "It {{was only a matter of}} time until he reached 100, you could wait for it." [...] Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing, then said, [...] "I always thought it was inevitable that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> But when he did, I stopped and thought about it. I couldn't believe it." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 2000s Pryce starred {{and participated in}} a variety of movies, such as The Affair of the Necklace (2001), Unconditional Love (2002), What a Girl Wants (2003), and Terry Gilliam's aborted project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage {{production}} of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. This production turned out to be very stressful for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show's run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying [...] "This will be your first Eliza, my second today and my third this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available." [...] Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. Despite the difficulty, the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies. Pryce did express interest in doing My Fair Lady in New York, but when asked if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with McCutcheon he said that [...] "there's as much chance of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as doing My Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the guilty}} verdict David Tomkins told the Seven Network that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again if {{confronted with the}} same situation. He {{said it was the}} third time in two years that his home had been broken into, and that he only wanted to detain Boland, {{according}} to an AAP report. [...] "My proud home keeps getting broken into and robbed," [...] said Tomkins. [...] "All I did was detain one of the criminals for the police." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle {{vetoed the}} British {{application}} {{to join the}} European Economic Community (EEC) in 1963, famously uttering the single word 'non' into the television cameras at the critical moment, a statement used to sum up French opposition towards Britain for many years afterwards. Macmillan said afterwards that he always believed that de Gaulle would prevent Britain joining, but thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> quietly, behind the scenes. He later complained privately that [...] "all our plans are in tatters".|$|E

50|$|Despite this decision, his rescue attempt contributed {{significantly}} to saving Simpson's life. Simpson has always vehemently defended Yates, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> himself had the roles been reversed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] said the Countess. [...] "But then Carstairs is {{so very much}} in earnest. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> for himself if you hadn't <b>done</b> <b>it</b> for him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, Messner {{championed the}} cause for {{ascending}} Mount Everest without supplementary oxygen, saying that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] "by fair means" [...] or not at all. In 1978, he reached the summit of Everest with Habeler. This {{was the first time}} anyone had been that high without bottled oxygen and Messner and Habeler proved what certain doctors, specialists, and mountaineers thought impossible. [...] He repeated the feat, without Habeler, from the Tibetan side in 1980, during the monsoon season. This was Everest's first solo summit.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{was a major}} {{focal point}} of dissatisfaction with Turner, with many polls showing his popularity. His 1985 book, Straight from the Heart, recounted his early life in Shawinigan, his years spent in the Canadian House of Commons as both a member of {{parliament}} and Cabinet Minister, and his failed 1984 leadership bid. It was an instant best-seller. In a 1985 interview, Frank Moores told Peter C. Newman: I was down fishing with Chrétien last week, and he really hates Turner with a passion. He {{might be interested in}} joining the Tories if Turner is re-elected Liberal leader, although it would take a lot of discussion. Ed Broadbent later recalled that Chrétien harboured a marked degree of animosity towards Turner and that [...] "I noticed that any negative comment Chrétien could make about John Turner in the lobbies, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I didn't like that".|$|E
2500|$|An inquest {{was opened}} at Brandon Hill near Croydon on 16 July 1928 and after {{identification}} of the four passengers was adjourned. The inquest resumed on 30 July 1928 and it was explained to the inquest by an employee of Imperial Airways {{that it was not}} unusual for passengers to be taken on test flight and those on board had permission. The coroner questioned the wisdom of allowing passengers on what could be a dangerous test flight and was told all the passengers had signed indemnity documents. The employee in charge of the two girls on the flight said they had asked her for permission and it was allowed {{as long as it was}} not for more than 15 minutes. An engineering superintendent said employees were keen to take [...] "Joy Rides" [...] but agreed that it was sometimes [...] "a bother". The passenger who survived the accident told the inquest that staff thought of it as a privilege to go on a joy ride and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E

2500|$|Shark Boy {{made his}} return to TNA wrestling on the May 23, 2013 episode of Impact Wrestling. He {{wrestled}} against Robbie E in a losing effort on the following episode of TNA Xplosion after his TV appearance. On March 17, 2013, Shark Boy appeared on TNA 10 Reunion where {{he was in a}} 10-man Gauntlet match, which was won by Matt Morgan, that aired on August 2, 2013. On March 19, 2013, Shark Boy next appeared on Hardcore Justice 2 where he won a nine-man Hardcore Gauntlet Battle Royal, which aired on July 5, 2013. He then made another appearance on November 21 at TNA Turning Point, facing Ethan Carter III in a losing effort. On October 2, 2014, Shark Boy made yet another appearance facing off against Manik and losing, then lost again on the October 15th 2014 show against Tyrus. He made an appearance in the Oct. 29th taping during a backstage segment where he was signing autographs, getting a pep talk from road agent Pat Kenney to get back to being [...] "the real shark" [...] referring to {{when he was in his}} prime. Shark Boy said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> However, on January 1, 2015, Shark Boy's profile was moved to TNA Alumni section, perhaps ending the angle. On the July 9, 2015 episode of Impact, he returned as a competitor in Ethan Carter III's 3 vs 1 Gauntlet Match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. In 2017 he returned at Slammiversary XV.|$|E

60|$|RANKIN. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{for your}} sake, Leddy Ceecily, {{but for his}} own. The Sultan would get into trouble with England if you were killed; and the Sultan would kill the chief to pacify the English government.|$|R
