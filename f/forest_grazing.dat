50|$|When in {{the wake}} of the Thirty Years' War German kings’ power had {{declined}} and Germany had splintered into more than 300 statelets, some of the king’s rights passed to the princes. Among the Waldgraves’ and Rhinegraves’ lordly rights by 1648 were military, judicial and customs authority, the right to mint coins and all mining rights. These rights represented important income sources for the lord, as other lordly rights pertaining to water, <b>forest,</b> <b>grazing</b> land, hunting and fishing always had.|$|E
50|$|These {{settlements}} must {{be imagined}} as increasingly large settlement chambers enclosed in forest, which {{at that time}} covered Middle-Europe. Still, the forest remained economically irreplaceable {{for a long time}} by means of <b>forest</b> <b>grazing,</b> logging and gathering of fruit, as pastures and meadows in the present sense did not yet exist. However, especially in the Loess areas, the forests quickly faded by intensive use within decades and their composition also changed with Elm and Tilia disappearing almost completely. However, the settlements continued to be islands in a sea of forest.|$|E
50|$|Several {{pollutants}} {{degrade the}} river. Nitrate and nitrite are pollutants {{of concern in}} the lower Little Blackfoot River (Elliston to Garrison). The use of the watershed for ranching, hay farming, and <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> accounts for about 75 percent of the nitrate and nitrite load. Toxic metal pollutants were first identified in the river in 1990. On the upper Little Blackfoot, cadmium, copper, cyanide, and lead exceeded by at least 10 percent the limit in which chronic impairment occurs in aquatic life. Levels of cadmium were twice the limit at which acute impairment of aquatic life occurred. Both arsenic and lead exceeded the allowable levels for human consumption.|$|E

By the early 19th century, many farmers switched from growing grain to raising dairy cattle and hay. In 1848 a dairy and cheese factory opened in the village. Between 1855 and 1863 the community drained the bogs on the valley floor, which opened up more farm land. In addition to agriculture, the institute and prison at Thorberg and a sandstone quarry provided jobs for the residents of the municipality.|$|E

50|$|The base had its {{beginning}} in 1940 {{when a group}} of concerned Valdosta and Lowndes County citizens began searching for a way to assist the expanding defense program. A committee was formed to obtain a military airfield for their community. In October 1940, the committee sent a letter to Maxwell AAF inviting the Air Corps to consider the Valdosta area. When engineers arrived, they rejected the existing Valdosta Municipal Airport because of excessive grading costs and began looking for another site. The Air Corps found an acceptable site 11.5 miles NNE of Valdosta near the small settlement of Bemis. The site was located on the Lakeland Flatwoods Project, a 9300 acre tract of sub-marginal land, not primarily suited for cultivation. The United States Department of Agriculture, which owned the land, was experimenting at that time with <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> at the project. The Air Corps approved to locate the base on the tract in March 1941. Two months later, on 14 May, the Department of Agriculture transferred ownership of the property to the War Department.|$|E
50|$|The {{most salient}} {{feature of the}} Tamworth is its great {{hardiness}} with respect to adverse climates. Thus, the breed does well in its more northerly settings such as Scotland and Canada, where winters are severe, not only in regard to cold but also high winds. The animal is not only durable and rugged, but also is extremely well-suited for <b>forest</b> <b>grazing,</b> being able to thrive on bracken. Tamworths graze compatibly with cattle, being able to retrieve forage that cattle leave behind in the open pasture. This said, Tamworth pigs can be protective of their territories, thus somewhat aggressive towards any other livestock in the same pasture. This animal is very efficient at excavation while rooting for food in the forest or pasture. The breed is used in forage-based farming systems. The sows demonstrate good maternal skills, being consistent in suckling all littermates. Litters normally {{range in size from}} six to ten piglets. Piglets at birth are usually wild and wary of humans, but easily adjust to human interaction. Tamworths display a good disposition and enjoy the attention of humans. The Tamworth pig is ready for slaughter in 25-30 weeks.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{influence}} of the past land uses on modern forest ground vegetation communities by combining historical records with field sampling. The history of forest uses was inferred from historical and census records, and site variables and ground vegetation composition were collected and measured based on 42 plots within five forests situated on the French-Spanish border. Both site and land use variables explained the observed pattern of ground vegetation composition. The most important part of this variation was explained by the site variables that bring together environmental and habitat variables. The chief determinants of forest use were the historical forestry treatment and the historical dominant livestock. The species assemblage of <b>forests</b> historically <b>grazed</b> by cattle and treated as coppice selective system or without forestry practices {{for more than a century}} reflected high level of disturbances. On the contrary, the species assemblage of the <b>forests</b> historically <b>grazed</b> by sheep and that experienced coppice selective system or both coppice-with-standards and timber forestry treatment reflected a lower disturbance context. Finally, the <b>forest</b> historically <b>grazed</b> by both cattle and sheep and treated as coppice-with-standard revealed an intermediate level of disturbances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Silvopastoral {{systems are}} {{a crucial part}} of the European {{cultural}} landscape and biocultural heritage. In Hungary, due to the intensification of agriculture and forestry management, silvopastoral practices were nearly totally abandoned during the last decades. In this paper, I review Hungarian ethnographic literature to discover the traditional silvopastoral management of Hungary. The papers were published in Hungarian, mainly in different ethnographic journals and in several books. In Hungary, until the passage of the Forest and Pastureland Separation Act (1853), <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> was a free right along with other silvopastoral methods, except pannage. Woodlands were natural shelters and sources of diverse fodder. Collecting leaf-fodder, leaf-litter, wild fruit and acorn were integral and common parts of traditional extensive livestock husbandry. The importance of silvopastoral systems increased during extreme weather conditions. All of them were controlled to avoid overuse and forest damage. Today, wood pasture management and illegal <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> is still alive, but the new forest law once again gives permission for regulated <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> in some cases. The openness towards silvopastoral managements is influenced by the new agroforestry innovations movement...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic {{simulation}} model describing long-term forest development under different grazing pressures {{is presented as}} an illustration of system analysis in <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> research. In this paper, {{a brief description of}} the model is presented as are some simulation results. The <b>FORest</b> <b>GRAzing</b> model (FORGRA) simulates monthly changes in the characteristics of herbaceous understory and individual trees in plots, based on underlying physiological processes. Special attention is paid to the simulation of diet composition in relation to ungulate species, food quality and food availability, and accounting for seasonal variation in these factors. The model is parameterized for 12 tree and shrub species, six species of the ground flora and four ungulate species: roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), Highland cattle (Bos taurus) and Konik ponies (Equus caballus). The results presented in this paper concern the development of a pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the Netherlands under various grazing pressures over a period of 100 years. They show that even low densities of ungulates can have significant impacts on the regeneration and thereby on forest development. It is argued that this approach is generally applicable in <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> research, providing a means for quantitative interpretation of the interaction between herbivory and forest development...|$|E

30|$|While {{farmers who}} stopped practising <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> {{generally}} chose to replace their mountain cattle with {{larger and more}} productive lowland cattle, those who continued with <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> generally did not. The main reason was that farmers who kept up the tradition of forest pasturing remained dependent on the mountain cattle breed's adaptiveness to its environment. Other reasons listed by the farmers interviewed were that mountain cattle milk is more suitable for home-made cheese production owing to its higher fat content, while lowland cattle is ideal as drinking milk and suits those farmers delivering milk to commercial dairies. Some simply argued that mountain cows are more beautiful, more trustworthy or have gentler ways or a more independent and intriguing mind. This attachment of farmers to their cows deserves some attention, as {{it is important to}} understand their reasons for continuity and resistance to change in their farming practices.|$|E

30|$|Current {{predator}} policies {{provide a}} good case for discussing which biodiversity matters and how natural heritage is defined in contemporary policymaking. Summer farms are supported by the Swedish Board of Agriculture through EU subsidies, as the grazing regimes employed result in a species-rich flora and high nature values in the forest. Most farmers interviewed {{in the present study}} claim it is possible, although certainly not unproblematic, to combine free-range <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> with brown bears (Ursus arctos, hereafter referred to as bears) resident within the grazing area. However, all the farmers I talked to claim it is impossible to combine free-range <b>forest</b> <b>grazing</b> with wolves (Canis lupus) also resident in the grazing area, for various reasons. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is protecting and managing the number of wolves present in each Swedish county. Wolves are said to be native to the Swedish fauna and as such they make up a natural heritage (Herlitz and Peterson 2011). Wolves make an important symbol of the wilderness associated with northern Sweden (ibid.), while grazing subsidies represent the common perception among ecologists today that semi-natural pastures hold the greatest biodiversity. Both the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency have decentralised part of their decision making to the regional county boards, which are now experiencing difficulty in effectively implementing conflicting policies. The historical background to the heated public debate on predator policies in Sweden is described briefly below.|$|E
