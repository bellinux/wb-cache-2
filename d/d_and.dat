This same similarity indicates that both <b>d</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 share same amount of information with d 1, however, a clear difference can be seen {{between the number of}} present terms; <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 use same term set, but <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 only share one term in common. Using Cosine similarity, the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is 0.763, and the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 is 0.831.

40|$|Abstract. Let <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 be discriminants of {{distinct}} quadratic imaginary orders and let J(d 1, d 2) denote {{the product of}} differences of CM j-invariants with discriminants <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2. In 1985, Gross and Zagier gave an elegant formula for the factorization of the integer J(d 1, d 2) in the case that <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 are relatively prime and discriminants of maximal orders. We generalize their methods and give a complete factorization in the case that d 1 is squarefree <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is the discriminant of any quadratic imaginary order. We also give a partial factorization in all other cases, and give a conjectural formula when the conductors of <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 are relatively prime. 1...|$|R
30|$|In this example, {{if we want}} to {{find the}} most similar {{document}} to d 1, the number of present terms alone cannot help, because <b>d</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 both have 4 terms in common with d 1. Using Manhattan distance, the distance between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is 12 and the distance between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 is 3. If we use Cosine similarity, the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is 0.9569 and the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 is 0.989. Accordingly, in this example, both Manhattan distance and Cosine similarity accurately recognize the most similar document to d 1. Therefore, it is possible that two documents use same term set but have different contents, because the associated terms have different weights. In such cases, most of the similarity measures can accurately judge the similarity between documents.|$|R

5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (<b>D)</b> <b>and</b> joining (J) segments. V, <b>D</b> <b>and</b> J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, <b>D</b> <b>and</b> J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one <b>D</b> <b>and</b> one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this phase I study were {{to determine the}} maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RD), antitumor activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed-paclitaxel combination. Patients (N = 95) with advanced solid tumors were assigned to three schedules (21 -day cycles [q 21 d]). Starting doses for each schedule of pemetrexed and paclitaxel, respectively, were: (S 1) 400 and 135 mg/m(2) on d 1; (S 2) 400 mg/m(2) <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> 40 mg/m(2) <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 8; S 3) 400 mg/m(2) <b>d</b> 8 <b>and</b> 30 mg/m(2) <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 8. MTD was 500 / 135 mg/m(2) (S 1), 400 / 40 mg/m(2) (S 2), and 500 / 120 mg/m(2) (S 3). Most common dose limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and neuromotor toxicities. Most common toxicity was grade 3 / 4 lymphopenia. Four patients had partial response, 43 patients had stable disease. The RD determined was pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) (<b>d</b> 8) <b>and</b> paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) (<b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 8), q 21 d.
