40|$|Kochia {{species has}} {{recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of researchers as a forage and fodder crop in marginal lands worldwide. Kochia is drought and salt tolerant and native to Iran. This plant has a potential to grow in saline soils and it can be irrigated with brackish water. To evaluate how salinity stress affects growth parameters, an experiment was conducted wherein plants of Kochia scoparia were exposed to six levels of saline waters (1. 5, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 dS/m). The function method was used for evaluating growth parameters. The results showed that all growth parameters decreased with increasing salinity higher than 7 dS/m. Kochia scoparia is a meso-halophyte, thus low salt stress (7 dS/m) improved its dry matter production and leaf area index (LAI). Stem dry weight (SDW) and plant dry weight (PDW) decreased significantly under salt stress, but the salt induced reduction in plant dry weight (PDW) was more than that in the former <b>growth</b> <b>attribute.</b> However, while salt stress improved leaf weight ratio (LWR) in K. scoparia. Salinity affected Kochia leaf morphology and increased leaf thickness. Fifty percent yield reduction occurred at 38. 8 dS/m salinity.

Growth indices included mean body weight, feed intake, feed conversion index, and specific growth rate. The null hypothesis that tank effect {{had no effect on}} growth over the 12 -week period was rejected (P = 0. 038), and mean weight in individual tanks differed by as much as 18. 7 %). During the study it was determined that the proximity of tanks to common-use walkways in the facility could affect growth indices. This was indicated by significant differences in the mean fish weights among blocks of tanks served by different header tanks after 4 (P = 0. 001) and 8 (P = 0. 024) week. The block containing tanks of fish with the highest them weight was nearest to the 2 common-use walkways in the facility. Fish in this block of tanks, compared with those in other blocks, had significantly greater feed intake but no significant differences in conversion efficiency. Compensatory growth, a well known <b>growth</b> <b>attribute</b> in fishes, diminished the difference in mean weight be tween these blocks of tanks {{by the end of the}} study. Comparison of paired ranks within header tank blocks indicated that fish in those located nearest to walkways had higher feeding rates over the 12 -week period (P = 0. 048), but less efficient feed conversion (P = 0. 040) than did fish in matched tanks located farthest from walkways.

The analysis reveals similarities and differences in the population transition path followed by the two countries and suggests that India lags behind China by about 30 years in terms of population transition. The population transition in China has been rapid and inconsistent, while India's population transition has been slow and consistent. The momentum for growth intrinsic to respective populations has been the main contributor to population growth in both countries. The demographic dividend resulting from population transition in India has been substantially smaller than that in China because of differences in population transition paths. Unlike in China, population transition appears to have contributed only marginally to economic growth in India.

Genotypes differed significantly in all studied attributes except in leaf number.
