50|$|The term <b>hay</b> <b>elevator</b> also {{includes}} machinery {{involved in the}} stacking and storage of bales. A typical <b>hay</b> <b>elevator</b> includes an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull 3-inch spikes every few feet along the chain to grab bales and drag them along. Prior to rural electrification, barns were equipped with a vertical pulley and a horizontal track along which a bale of hay was guided manually.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} using a hayloft is to create small bundles of hay (1-4 cubic feet), then hoist them up using a block and tackleâ€”in this case a <b>hay</b> <b>elevator</b> to the room. This allows for more {{efficiency}} when moving hay around.|$|E
50|$|In {{agriculture}} and manufacturing, an elevator/lift is {{any type of}} conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of <b>hay</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|J.A. Prestwich {{also made}} {{stationary}} engines under the JAP {{name for a}} variety of uses. They ranged in size from the smallest model 0 two-stroke engine to the much larger type 6 engine, and were used on rotovators, generating sets, milking sets, water pumps, lawnmowers, <b>hay</b> <b>elevators</b> and other agricultural machines. Most were 4-stroke, but there were some 2-stroke engines such as the model 0; they were quite reliable, and examples can still be seen at vintage rallies around Britain.|$|R
50|$|When {{electricity}} arrived, the bale spear, pulley {{and track}} system {{were replaced by}} long motorized bale conveyors known as <b>hay</b> <b>elevators.</b> A typical elevator is an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull 3 in spikes every few feet along the chain to grab bales and drag them along. One elevator replaced the spear track and ran {{the entire length of}} the peak of the barn. A second elevator was either installed at a 30-degree slope on the side of the barn to lift bales up to the peak elevator, or used dual front-back chains surrounding the bale to lift bales straight up the side of the barn to the peak elevator.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hay</b> <b>{{elevator}}</b> is {{an elevator}} that hauls bales of hay or straw up to a hayloft, {{the section of}} a barn used for hay storage. Hay elevators are either ramped conveyor belts that bales rest on, or a mechanized pair of chains that holds bales taut between them.|$|E
50|$|This {{complete}} <b>hay</b> <b>elevator</b> lifting, transport, {{and dropping}} system reduced bale storage labor {{to a single}} person, who simply pulls up with a wagon, turns on the elevators and starts placing bales on it, occasionally checking {{to make sure that}} bales are falling in the right locations in the loft.|$|E
