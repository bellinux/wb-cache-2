5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant <b>inner</b> <b>edge,</b> 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's <b>inner</b> <b>edge.</b> In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.|$|E
5|$|The ε ring {{is known}} to have {{interior}} and exterior shepherd moons—Cordelia and Ophelia, respectively. The <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of the ring is in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the outer edge is in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The masses of the moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε ring is estimated to be about 1016kg.|$|E

25|$|Senior {{officers}} usually wear {{distinguishing marks}} around {{the outer edge}} of the peaks of their caps (or under the capbadge for female officers, who do not wear peaked caps). Normally this is a raised black band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver (gold in the City of London Police) band for superintendents and chief superintendents, and a row of silver (gold in the City of London Police) oakleaves for chief officers. Chief constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police, and all commissioner ranks of the Metropolitan Police wear oakleaves on both the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>edges</b> of their peaks (or a double row beneath the capbadge for female officers). In Scotland, however, the mark is a silver band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver band and silver oakleaves on the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>edges</b> of the peak respectively for superintendents and chief superintendents, and silver oakleaves on the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>edges</b> of the peak for all chief officers.|$|R

5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

While {{the prospects}} for life on gas giants are unknown, {{it might be possible}} for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E

[...] Parker's Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry (1894) likewise states, [...] "A broad arrow differs somewhat... and resembles a pheon, except in the omission of the jagged edge {{on the inside of}} the barbs."

5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{observation}} {{has shown}} {{there are no}} bodies of three or more Jupiter masses in this system, out to at least a distance of 500AU from the host star. Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be detectable by Spitzer at distances beyond 80AU, but none has been discovered in this range. Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of the debris disk at 30–35AU.|$|E

They are named after the main member, 434 Hungaria; the group {{contains}} at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination.

40|$|Abstract. Finding communities, or clusters, in networks, or graphs, {{has been}} the subject of intense studies in the last ten years. The most used {{criterion}} for that purpose, despite some recent criticism, is modularity maximization, proposed by Newman and Girvan. It consists in maximizing the sum for all clusters of the number of <b>inner</b> <b>edges</b> minus the expected number of <b>inner</b> <b>edges</b> assuming the same distribution of degrees. Numerous heuristics, as well as a few exact algorithms have been proposed to maximize modularity. We apply the Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic to that problem. Computational results are reported for the instances of the 10 th DIMACS Implementation Challenge. The algorithm presented in this paper obtained the second prize in the quality modularity (sub) challenge of the referred competition, finding the best known solutions for 11 out of 30 instances. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22times as massive and 2.3times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280days that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method. WASP-7 is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28times as massive as the Sun. Its hot Jupiter planet—WASP-7b—was discovered by transit method and found to orbit the star every 4.95days. HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158AU from the star.|$|E

5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical depth of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an <b>inner</b> <b>edge</b> of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.|$|E
