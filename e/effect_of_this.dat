5|$|In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of {{weights and measures}} on the British Empire. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass.

5|$|Lazio faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The major issue {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office.

5|$|Less {{successful}} at first were {{the efforts of}} the American battleships to match their British counterparts in excellence of gunnery. Having provided numerous veteran gun-crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in the previous months, the gunnery complements of Division Nine were badly depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits. The inevitable <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> loss of talent became apparent when, on 17 December 1917, Battleship Division Nine conducted its first full-caliber target practice in nearby Pentland Firth.|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

5|$|In October 1939, {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. From January 1940, all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service. While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military, the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service. A side <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arrangement {{was the creation of}} two different armies with different conditions of service, one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF. This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war, as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces. Later, provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service. This required 65 percent of a unit's war establishment—or 75 percent of its actual strength—to volunteer and allowed whole battalions {{to become part of the}} AIF.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East {{and eastern}} Mediterranean, two ongoing {{international}} disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute {{turned into a}} crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid {{until the end of}} the year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E

5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E
5|$|The {{manpower}} problem {{was compounded by}} the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems {{came to a head}} in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.|$|E

5|$|There {{are fewer}} than 1000 adult birds in Tasmania, where {{the species is}} listed as Vulnerable under Schedule 3.1 of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. In Tasmania it is {{threatened}} by nest disturbance, loss of suitable nesting habitat, shooting, poisoning, trapping, and collision with power lines and wind turbines, as well as entanglement and environmental pollution. Estuaries are a favoured habitat, and these are often subject to environmental disturbance. white-bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms, but the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on breeding success is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E
