The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements <b>from</b> <b>scratch.</b>|$|E

Versions for games consoles were in development, but were cancelled.|$|E

When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Indiana, {{like the}} rest of the nation, was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana. Urbanization declined. Governor Paul V. McNutt's administration struggled to build <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were cut drastically in response to the Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax.

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models <b>from</b> <b>scratch.</b> To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, {{more than a year}} and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1962, Unicamp was {{designed}} <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> as an integrated research center unlike other top Brazilian universities, usually {{created by the}} consolidation of previously existing schools and institutes.

5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station.

The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes <b>from</b> <b>scratch.</b> The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title <b>from</b> <b>scratch</b> and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E
