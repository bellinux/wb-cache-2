40|$|Antarctica’s late Cenozoic (the past ~ 15 million years) climate {{history is}} poorly known from direct evidence, owing to its remoteness, an {{extensive}} sea ice apron, and an ice sheet cover {{over the region}} for the past 34 million years. Consequently, knowledge {{about the role of}} Antarctica’s ice sheets in global sea level and climate has relied heavily upon interpretations of oxygen isotope records from deep-sea cores. Whereas these isotopic records have revolutionized our understanding of climate-ice-ocean interactions, questions still remain about the specific role of Antarctic ice sheets in global climate. Such questions can be addressed from geological records at the marine margin of the ice sheets, recovered by drilling from floating <b>ice</b> <b>platforms</b> [e. g., Davey et al., 2001; Harwood et al., 2006; Barrett, 2007]...|$|R
25|$|The {{semi-nomadic}} eco-centred Inuit were fishers {{and hunters}} harvesting lakes, seas, <b>ice</b> <b>platforms</b> and tundra. While {{there are some}} allegations that Inuit were hostile to early French and English explorers, fishers and whalers, more recent {{research suggests that the}} early relations with whaling stations along the Labrador coast and later James Bay were based on a mutual interest in trade. In the final years of the 18th century, the Moravian Church began missionary activities in Labrador, supported by the British who were tired of the raids on their whaling stations. The Moravian missionaries could easily provide the Inuit with the iron and basic materials they had been stealing from whaling outposts, materials whose real cost to Europeans was almost nothing, but whose value to the Inuit was enormous and from then on contacts in Labrador were far more peaceful.|$|R
50|$|Physically and mechanically, glacial ice {{is akin to}} lake ice, {{river ice}} and icicles. The reason is that they all form from {{freshwater}} (non saline water). Ice sheets, ice caps and glaciers essentially consist of glacial ice. Since glacial ice spreads sideways and down-slope (as a result of gravity), in some areas this ice reaches the coastline. Where this happens, depending on topography, the ice may break up into pieces that fall in the sea, a mechanism called ice calving, and drift away. Alternatively, ice sheets may spread offshore into extensive floating <b>ice</b> <b>platforms</b> called <b>ice</b> shelves, which can ultimately also calve. The features produced by these calving processes are known as icebergs and may {{range in size from}} meter to kilometer scale. The very large ones, referred to as ice islands, are typically tabular in shape. These may be responsible for extreme gouging events.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{suitability}} of next-generation high-performance computing systems for petascale simulations {{will depend on}} various performance factors attributable to processor, memory, local and global network, and input/output characteristics. In this paper, we evaluate performance of new dual-core SGI Altix 4700, quad-core SGI Altix ICE 8200, and dual-core IBM POWER 5 + systems. To measure performance, we used micro-benchmarks from High Performance Computing Challenge (HPCC), NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), and four real-world applications— three from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and one from climate modeling. We used the micro-benchmarks to develop a controlled understanding of individual system components, then analyzed and interpreted performance of the NPBs and applications. We also explored the hybrid programming model (MPI+OpenMP) using multi-zone NPBs and the CFD application OVERFLOW- 2. Achievable application performance is compared across the systems.

40|$|Bohai is {{a typical}} {{marginal}} oil field in an ice region, {{where most of the}} oil and gas platforms are economical. Sea ice is the main factor that affects the safety of oil and gas platforms in Bohai. Due to the complexity of the ice load and ice-induced vibrations, there are large security risks when developing Bohai oil and gas in the winter. It is difficult to ensure the safe production of oil and gas in winter using existing sea ice disaster warning technologies. Based on winter oil and gas production in the Bohai Sea’s Liaodong Bay, a set of suitable sea ice management systems is proposed in this paper. These systems integrate sea ice monitoring, risk assessment and risk prediction technologies. Based on the risk warning system, an ice management model of a Bohai <b>ice</b> <b>platform</b> has been put into practice, which ensures the safe production of the platform in winter...|$|R
50|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II Perutz was rounded up along with other persons of German or Austrian background, and sent to Newfoundland (on orders from Winston Churchill). After being interned for several months he returned to Cambridge. Because of his previous research into {{the changes in the}} arrangement of the crystals in the different layers of a glacier before the War he was asked for advice on whether if a battalion of commandos were landed in Norway, could they be hidden in shelters under glaciers. His knowledge on the subject of ice then lead to him in 1942 being recruited for Project Habakkuk. This was a secret project to build an <b>ice</b> <b>platform</b> in mid-Atlantic, which could be used to refuel aircraft. To that end he investigated the recently invented mixture of ice and woodpulp known as pykrete. He carried out early experiments on pykrete in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London.|$|R

40|$|Abstract As {{climate change}} {{advances}} {{the date of}} spring breakup in Hudson Bay, polar bears are coming ashore ear-lier. Since they would have lost some of their opportunities to hunt ringed seals from a sea <b>ice</b> <b>platform,</b> they may be deWcient in energy. Subadult polar bears appear to come ashore before more mature individuals and the earliest subadults are beginning to overlap the nesting period of the large colony of snow geese also occupying the Cape Churchill Peninsula. The eggs these bears are known to eat could make up some of their energy shortfall. The earlier these eggs are consumed during the snow goose nesting period, the greater would be the energy that is available. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the annual survival rate for subadult bears declined in contrast to that of prime aged individuals. If this reduction in survival is related to an increasing energy deWcit, as suggested by some, the con-sumption of goose eggs may reverse the trend and help sta-bilize the population, at least for some period of time. The total number of polar bears that could beneWt from this resource will depend on the increasing temporal overlap with the nesting period and on the foraging behaviors of individuals eating the eggs. It is likely that other food sources will also have to play a role if the polar bears are to persist...|$|R
2500|$|There were {{approximately}} 150,000 circumpolar Inuit in 2005 in Greenland, Alaska, Russia, and Canada. According to Kirt Ejesiak, former secretary {{and chief of}} staff to then-Premier of Nunavut, Paul Okalik and the first Inuk from Nunavut to attend Harvard, for the c. 46,000 Canadian Inuit, the seal was not [...] "just a source of cash through fur sales, but the keystone of their culture. Although Inuit harvest and hunt many species that inhabit the desert tundra and <b>ice</b> <b>platforms,</b> the seal is their mainstay. The Inuktitut vocabulary designates specific objects made from seal bone, sinew, fat and fur used as tools, games, thread, cords, fuel, clothing, boats, and tents. There are also words referring to seasons, topography, place names, legends, and kinship relationships based on the seal. One region of Canada's north is inhabited by the Netsilingmiut, or [...] "people of the seal." [...] The title of Ejesiak's article acknowledged the pivotal 1991 publication entitled Animal Rights, Human Rights by George Wenzel, a McGill University geographer and anthropologist who worked more than two decades with the Clyde Inuit of Baffin Island. Wenzel's [...] "scholarly examination" [...] of [...] "the impact of the animal rights movement upon the culture and economy of the Canadian Inuit" [...] {{was among the first to}} reveal how animal rights groups, [...] "well-meaning people in the dominant society through misunderstanding and ignorance can inflict destruction" [...] on a vulnerable minority.|$|R
40|$|Work on the {{mechanics}} of ice, {{has resulted in a}} number of significant advances in the last 10 years. The factors influencing the growth of various types of sea ice have been quantified fundamentally and methods for examining the resulting material structure have been developed. Extensive work has been done on strength and deformation characteristics of ice. A significant effort has been the development of analytical expressions to describe the rheological behavior of ice. Elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and creep were also treated. A great deal has been done on measuring the compressive strength of various types of naturally occurring ice and subsequently these data were combined into a suitable description of a failure envelope. Work has also been done on measuring the flexural strength, shear strength, adhesion and fracture toughness. Methods for laboratory testing and in situ measurements of mechanical properties have been developed. The problem of defining ice forces on structures has been the primary motivation for research on ice. Analytical modelling, physical modelling, laboratory studies and very extensive field studies have been used. Work done in this area has included development of methods and their application to actual problems and has benefitted greatly from the integration of all four approaches. Ice and ice covers have been successfully used to support various offshore activities: drilling of floating <b>ice</b> <b>platforms,</b> stabilizing grounded rubble fields to protect structures and transporting large loads over ice.

5000|$|At {{the turn}} of 1996/1997, a {{contract}} was awarded for section 23 of the new line, which covered a 3.3 km-long section, which was mainly located {{in the area of}} the town of Siegburg. At a cost of about Deutsche Mark (DM) 40 million, two through high-speed tracks would be built, platforms would be built or modified and bridges would be built or rebuilt. As part of the construction of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed line, the old station was demolished in 2000 and replaced by a new building, which was opened in late September 2004. There was also urban redevelopment around the station. In particular, the old station building had to be demolished for the new line. Deutsche Bahn and the town of Siegburg advertised a design competition for the new building. [...] On 25 June 2001, representatives of Deutsche Bahn and the town of Siegburg signed a framework agreement for the renovation of the station. Four days later, the construction contract was awarded. The opening was planned for the third quarter of 2002. From 1,200 to 3,000 square metres of floor area was provided for trading and other services. In addition, two new tracks were laid so that ICE services could stop or run through non-stop. The through tracks can be run at 200 km/h and the entry and exit tracks to the two <b>ICE</b> <b>platform</b> tracks can be run at 100 km/h.|$|R
