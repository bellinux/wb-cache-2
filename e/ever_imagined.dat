She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. She would later say her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had <b>ever</b> <b>imagined.</b> In July 2008, she accepted the invitation to become an honorary member of the 100-year-old black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha, which had no active undergraduate chapter at Princeton when she attended.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{with the}} Soviet Union and China {{came to a}} head in the Korean War, and {{it became clear that the}} peacetime Navy would have to be much larger than <b>ever</b> <b>imagined.</b> Fleets were {{assigned}} to geographic areas around the world, and ships were sent to hot spots as a standard part of the response to the periodic crises. However, because the North Korean navy was not large, the Korean War featured few naval battles; the combatant navies served mostly as naval artillery for their in-country armies. A large amphibious landing at Inchon succeeded in driving the North Koreans back across the 38th parallel. The Battle of Chosin Reservoir ended with the evacuation of almost 105,000 UN troops from the port of Hungnam.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to discovering {{diversity in the}} past, Europeans discovered diversity in the present. The voyages of discovery of the 16th and 17th centuries acquainted Europeans with new and different cultures in the Americas, in Asia, and in the Pacific. They discovered a greater amount of cultural diversity than they had <b>ever</b> <b>imagined,</b> and the question arose of how this vast amount of human cultural diversity could be compatible with the biblical account of Noah's descendants. In particular, the ideas of Confucius, translated into European languages by the Jesuits stationed in China, {{are thought to have}} had considerable influence on the deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Christianity.|$|E

500|$|The case raised {{questions}} about the extent of whistleblower protection for healthcare providers who report patient care concerns to licensing authorities. Texas law included remedies against retaliation for whistleblowers, but no known U.S. state had whistleblower laws that addressed appropriate prosecutorial conduct. According to the Texas Nurses Association, [...] "No one <b>ever</b> <b>imagined</b> that a nurse would be criminally prosecuted for reporting a patient care concern to a licensing agency." [...] After the Mitchell case, protection from prosecution was incorporated into Texas whistleblower laws. The TMB stopped investigating anonymous complaints about physicians in September 2011.|$|E
500|$|Zhou Lian, an {{associate}} professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you <b>ever</b> <b>imagined</b> are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had <b>ever</b> <b>imagined</b> was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goodall is a {{vegetarian}} and advocates the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. In The Inner World of Farm Animals, Goodall writes that farm animals are [...] "far more aware and intelligent than we <b>ever</b> <b>imagined</b> and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings {{in their own}} right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?"

2500|$|The {{departure}} of sculpture from nature tends toward architecture, writes Apollinaire: [...] "The utilitarian end aimed at by most contemporary architects {{is responsible for}} the great backwardness of architecture as compared with the other arts. The architect, the engineer should have sublime aims: to build the highest tower, to prepare for time and ivy the most beautiful of ruins, to throw across a harbor or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, and finally to compose to a lasting harmony, the most powerful <b>ever</b> <b>imagined</b> by man. Duchamp-Villon had this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and an architect, light {{is the only thing that}} count for him; but in all the arts, also, it is only light, the incorruptible light, that counts." ...|$|E

Individually, of course, there's so much left to do and it'll be a challenge to do it without the band – but it's also exciting {{at the same time to}} map out a new plan. Right now it's too early to think about my musical future, so I'll cross that bridge when I reach it." [...] said Omar Bilal Akhtar. Where as, Yasir Qureshi and Ali Alam said that would continue to pursue their career as musicians. On 14 May, The Express Tribune released an article about the history of the band and suggesting the band as one of the most active band's from Karachi coming to an end.|$|E
