500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} in Los Angeles, California on September 10, 2010 by Colin Tilley. It chronicles Ciara in a menagerie of settings, in the mountains, a mansion, a reflection pool, and a warehouse. The minimalistic clip sees numerous wardrobe changes, and unlike typical Ciara videos, {{it does not}} highlight dance aspects. Several outfits she dons include low-riding jeans and a shirt which reveals her abs. Becky Bain of Idolator compared Ciara to Janet Jackson in the clip, noting Ciara's [...] "oversized top and comfy jeans" [...] to Jackson in [...] "Again" [...] and [...] "Love Will Never Do." [...] Bain positively reviewed the clip, stating, [...] "It's a safe video, for sure, but oh-so nice to look at." [...] A Rap-Up writer stated [...] "after watching the grown 'n' [...] sexy new Colin Tilley-directed video from Ciara, you're guaranteed to be left 'Speechless.'" [...] Although he appreciated Ciara for lowering down the sex appeal and relying on her vocals, Ed Easton, Jr. of WXRK gave the video seven of ten stars, and {{said that it was}} not enough to put Ciara [...] "ahead of all the talented musical divas in the industry." [...] Easton {{went on to say that}} [...] "the video is not meant to be over-sexual but still <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> intimate feel to the singer that, in the long run, may even garner better responses among all age demographics."

500|$|However, as {{the season}} progressed, head coach Seth Greenberg began giving Garland fewer minutes. Following the {{recovery}} of freshman Marquis Rankin from a torn meniscus, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs Norfolk State. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, [...] "Marquis [...] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to get other guys more minutes". When asked a similar question the day before, he said that [...] "you can't play 13 guys". On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on Twitter that {{he was planning to}} transfer out of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia. Garland became the third men's basketball player to transfer out of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to Valparaiso, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with Georgia State. Garland finished his sophomore year at Virginia Tech averaging 4.6 points, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 turnovers in eight appearances. In late December 2011, he began competing for La Salle. Explorers head coach John Giannini said, [...] "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. He <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> experienced player to continue our growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." [...] Several of the team's top scorers in 2011–12 had experience playing high school basketball in the Philadelphia Public and Catholic Leagues.|$|E

So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [...] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, {{it seems to me that}} he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain." ...|$|E
