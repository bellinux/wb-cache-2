In this project, the oxidation behavior of an HVOF CoNiCrAlYSi coating on IN 792 was studied in both isothermal oxidation (900, 1000 and 1100 °C) and thermal cycling (1100 - 100 °C). The microstructural evolution in the MCrAlX coatings after oxidation was investigated.

The building process involves the movement of building blocks, followed by interaction and binding between them. The <b>diffusion</b> of building <b>blocks</b> is an important kinetic factor influencing the shape development of materials, but this issue has not yet been well investigated by the material research community. In this paper, we take the preparation of silver particles as an example to investigate how the <b>diffusion</b> of building <b>blocks</b> influences the shape of silver products. The silver products are prepared by reducing silver ions in a mixture of ethylene glycol and water. Through a change in the volume ratio of ethylene glycol in water, the <b>diffusion</b> of building <b>blocks</b> is tuned, which results in the formation of silver products with various shapes from rectangular plates to spindle rods. This shape variation is attributed to the change of the diffusion rate of building blocks, and the mechanism underlying these phenomena is investigated by simulation using a newly developed diffusion reaction model.

The most significant was the delivery of pressurized water through a mechanical pump at approximately 9 bar, replacing the piston-lever designs of the 1950s. Faema circumvented the problem of running heated water through the pump, by running cold water through the pump, through a heat exchange tube through the steam boiler to flash heat the water, before entering the <b>diffusion</b> <b>block</b> and through the ground coffee to create an espresso. Faema also introduced a new grouphead that was kept warm by circulating water from the boiler through the grouphead in a thermosyphon circuit. The grouphead was activated by a lever, which when partially open, allows the release of pressure created from the municipal water line. That pressure soaked the coffee with brew-temperature water, allowing for a smoother extraction.

40|$|With {{superior}} oxidation and corrosion resistance, {{metallic coatings}} (i. e. diffusion coatings and MCrAlX coatings) {{are widely used}} to protect hot components made of superalloys in turbine engines. Two issues are critically important for the coating at high temperatures: thermal property related to oxidation/corrosion behavior and microstructure stability, and mechanical properties (e. g. creep and fatigue). The aim of this project is to develop {{better understanding of the}} thermal and mechanical behaviors of metallic coatings on superalloys and to improve the accuracy of prediction of their lifetime by thermodynamic modeling. The present work includes an investigation on the oxidation behavior of MCrAlX coating with a new lifetimeprediction model and a study on the influence of diffusion coatings on creep and fatigue behaviors of the superalloy IN 792. Experiments on isothermal and thermal cycling oxidation were designed to investigate the oxidation behavior of a HVOF CoNiCrAlYSi coating on superalloy IN 792. It is found that the oxidation behaviors of the coating are related to its thermodynamic property. A diffusion model has been established using the homogenization models in the DICTRA software and taking into consideration of the influence of surface oxidation, coating-substrate interdiffusion and <b>diffusion</b> <b>blocking</b> effect caused by internal voids and oxides. The simulation results show an improved accuracy of lifetime prediction by introducing the <b>diffusion</b> <b>blocking</b> effect. Microstructural evolution during creep process at high temperatures was studied in different diffusion coatings (NiAl and PtAl). It is found that the inward diffusion of aluminum controls the thickening rate of the diffusion coatings. The developed coatings displayed two types of mechanical behavior - being easily plasticized or cracked - dependent on temperature and type of coating, and therefore could be considered as non-load carrying material during creep test. The influence of cracking of PtAl coating on the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior of the IN 792 was also investigated. The results show that precracking of the coating prior to the fatigue test has little influence on the fatigue limit of specimens with thin coating (50 μm) but lowers the fatigue limit of specimens with thick coating (70 μm). The through-coating crack has enough mobility to penetrate into the substrate and causes fatigue failure only when the driving force for crack propagation is increased above a critical value due to a higher applied stress or a larger crack length (thicker coating).

First fold reduces noise with wavelet block based thresholding, which affects image object boundaries and texture, {{thereby reducing the}} visual quality of objects in the image. The second fold restores object boundaries and texture from original ultrasound image through wavelet block fusion. Fusion rules and wavelet decomposition level selection between blocks of original US and threshold denoised US image is achieved using gradient histogram based Normalized Differential Mean (NDM) valve for adjacent blocks. Object blocks having boundary and texture are restored at lowest level from original US image and non-object regions from thresholded US image from the first fold. Hard and soft wavelet thresholding methods are incorporated in the first fold. The two fold methods are Adaptive Normalized <b>Diffusion</b> Mean <b>Block</b> Fusion - Hard Thresholding (ANBF-HT) and Adaptive Normalized <b>Diffusion</b> Mean <b>Block</b> Fusion - Soft Thresholding (ANBF-ST) for different block sizes.

40|$|The endodermis is a root {{cell layer}} common to higher plants and of {{fundamental}} importance for root function and nutrient uptake. The endodermis separates outer (peripheral) from inner (central) cell layers {{by virtue of}} its Casparian strips, precisely aligned bands of specialized wall material. Here we reveal that the membrane at the Casparian strip is a diffusional barrier between the central and peripheral regions of the plasma membrane and that it mediates attachment to the extracellular matrix. This membrane region thus functions like a tight junction in animal epithelia, although plants lack the molecular modules that establish tight junction in animals. We have also identified a pair of influx and efflux transporters that mark both central and peripheral domains of the plasma membrane. These transporters show opposite polar distributions already in meristems, but their localization becomes refined and restricted upon differentiation. This "central-peripheral" polarity coexists with the apical-basal polarity defined by PIN proteins within the same cells, but utilizes different polarity determinants. Central-peripheral polarity can be already observed in early embryogenesis, where it reveals a cellular polarity within the quiescent center precursor cell. A strict <b>diffusion</b> <b>block</b> between polar domains is common in animals, but had never been described in plants.

The {{structure is}} based on placing a <b>diffusion</b> <b>blocking</b> layer (DBL) between the device's top electrode (TE) and the resistive switching layer (RSL), unlike conventional CBRAMs, where the TE serves as a supply reservoir for metallic species diffusing into the RSL to form a conductive filament (CF) and is kept {{in direct contact with}} the RSL. The properties of a conventional CBRAM structure (Cu/HfO 2 /TiN), having a Cu TE, 10 [*]nm HfO 2 RSL, and a TiN bottom electrode, are compared with a 2 [*]nm TaN DBL incorporating structure (Cu/TaN/HfO 2 /TiN) for 103 programming and erase simulation cycles. The low and high resistive state values for each cycle are calculated and the analysis reveals that adding the DBL yields lower degradation. In addition, the 2 D distribution plots of oxygen vacancies, O ions, and Cu species within the RSL indicate that oxidation occurring in the DBL-RSL interface results in the formation of a sub-stoichiometric tantalum oxynitride with higher blocking capabilities that suppresses further Cu insertion beyond an initial CF formation phase, as well as CF lateral widening during cycling. The higher endurance of the structure with DBL may thus be attributed to the relatively low amount of Cu migrating into the RSL during the initial CF formation. Furthermore, this isomorphic CF displays similar cycling behavior to neural ionic channels.

Quantitative measurements of critical solute concentrations, e. g. limiting nutrients, are not yet feasible within the typical volumes {{in the range of}} picolitres. A way to gain new insights about the mass transport within those volumes is by simulation, but the complex geometry resulting from the multitude of cells within a colony leads to time and resource consuming computational challenges. In this work, six different concepts for the model representation of cellular microcolonies within microfluidic monolayer growth chamber devices are compared. The Gini coefficient is proposed as new measure for inhomogeneity within cellular colonies. An example cell colony is represented by a single point source, a cylindrical volume with homogeneous reaction rates with and without adjusted diffusion coefficient, as point sources for each single cell and as rod-shaped, <b>diffusion</b> <b>blocking,</b> three-dimensional cells with varying shapes. Simulated concentration profiles across the chambers depended strongly on the chosen cell representation. The representation with the lowest degree of abstraction, three-dimensional cells, leads to complex geometries and high computational effort, but also gives a conservative and therefore preferable estimate for the cultivation conditions within a given cultivation chamber geometry. Interestingly, the cylindrical volume with adjusted diffusion coefficient gives similar results but requires far less computational effort. Therefore, it is proposed to use the three-dimensional cells for detailed studies and to determine parameters for the cylindrical volume with adjusted diffusion coefficient, which can then be used for experimental design, screening of parameter spaces, and similar applications...|$|R

40|$|Thermal barrier coating (TBC) {{systems are}} coating systems {{containing}} a metallic bond {{coat and a}} ceramic top coat. TBCs are used in gas turbines for thermal insulation and oxidation resistance. Life prediction of TBCs is important as high-temperature exposure degrades the coatings through mechanisms such as thermal fatigue and the formation and growth of thermally grown oxides (TGOs). This thesis presents research on durability assessment and life prediction of air plasma sprayed TBCs. The adhesion of thermal barrier coatings subjected to isothermal oxidation, thermal cycling fatigue and thermal shock was studied. The adhesion strength and fracture characteristics were found to vary with heat treatment type. The influence of interdiffusion between bond coat and substrate was studied on TBCs deposited on two different substrates. The thermal fatigue life was found to differ between the two TBC systems. While fractography and nanoindentation revealed no differences between the TBC systems, the oxidation kinetics was found to differ for non-alumina oxides. The influence of bond coat/top coat interface roughness on the thermal fatigue life was studied; higher interface roughness promoted longer thermal fatigue life. Different interface geometrieswere tried in finite element crack growth simulations, and procedures for creating accurate interface models were suggested. The influence of water vapour and salt deposits on the oxidation/corrosion of a NiCoCrAlY coating and a TBC were studied. Salt deposits gave thicker TGOs and promoted an Y-rich phase.
