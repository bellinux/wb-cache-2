40|$|The central {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} study is: why does Congress select an independent commission to administer some regulatory programs while for others it chooses a <b>departmental</b> <b>agency?</b> Systematic research on this question is notably absent despite the emphasis given organizational arrangements by executive branch reform efforts, specifically those proposed by the Brownlow Committee in 1937 and the Ash Council in 1971. The regulatory literature simply suggests that the commission form of organization is superior to alternative arrangements because it provides {{a greater degree of}} fairness, impartiality, expertise, and continuity of policy. This study argues that the belief in the superiority of the commission form of organization constitutes essentially a formal rationale for the choice of a commission and that it is instead political forces which lead to not only the creation of new agencies, but to their organizational arrangements as well. Moreover, this study offers three alternative explanations for the choice of an independent regulatory commission: legislative-executive rivalry, the disruption of traditional clientele ties, and partisan differences between the White House and Capitol Hill. Seven cases were selected for examination, four independent commissions: the FERC, the CFTC, the NRC, and the CPSC, and three departmental agencies: the OSHA, the FGIS, and the MSHA. In order to determine the relative strength of the three factors, the arguments of congressmen, administration officials, and interest group spokesmen were examined as they appeared in such sources as the Congressional Record, congressional committee hearings and reports, and various other government documents. For each of the seven agencies, the factors were then categorized as either strong, moderate, or weak. The research demonstrated that the choice of organizational arrangements is a complex decision; no single explanation emerged. Legislative-executive rivalry and the disruption of traditional clientele ties distinguished relatively well between the two types of regulatory agencies and both factors were either strong or moderate for {{all but one of the}} four commissions. Partisan differences, however, failed to distinguish between the commissions and agencies. It was moderately significant in six of the seven cases....

Two land use options are simulated in four selected catchments in the Hulu Langat Forest Reserve (HLFR), Selangor.

The study computes the potential sedimentation impacts of each option on the dam and water intake ponds in the catchments. It then estimates the benefits derived from logging, hydroelectric power (HEP) generation, water regulatory dam for water treatment, and costs associated with sedimentation under the two options.

40|$|Abstract Background With {{the advent}} of {{workplace}} health and wellbeing programs designed to address prolonged occupational sitting, tools to measure behaviour change within this environment should derive from empirical evidence. In this study we measured aspects of validity and reliability for the Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire that asks employees to recount the percentage of work time they spend in the seated, standing, and walking postures during a typical workday. Methods Three separate cohort samples (N[*]=[*] 236) were drawn from a population of government desk-based employees across several <b>departmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> These volunteers {{were part of a}} larger state-wide intervention study. Workplace sitting and physical activity behaviour was measured both subjectively against the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and objectively against ActivPal accelerometers before the intervention began. Criterion validity and concurrent validity {{for each of the three}} posture categories were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, and a bias comparison with 95  % limits of agreement. Test-retest reliability of the survey was reported with intraclass correlation coefficients. Results Criterion validity for this survey was strong for sitting and standing estimates, but weak for walking. Participants significantly overestimated the amount of walking they did at work. Concurrent validity was moderate for sitting and standing, but low for walking. Test-retest reliability of this survey proved to be questionable for our sample. Conclusions Based on our findings we must caution occupational health and safety professionals about the use of employee self-report data to estimate workplace physical activity. While the survey produced accurate measurements for time spent sitting at work it was more difficult for employees to estimate their workplace physical activity...|$|R
30|$|Dealing with linear risk issues (which are {{associated}} with low scores for complexity, scientific uncertainty, and sociopolitical ambiguity), requires hardly any changes to conventional public policy-making.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an {{investigation}} into the issues impacting {{on the role of the}} primary headteacher. The research is framed within the calls in the early years of the 21 st century to redesign the school system leading to a degree of earned autonomy and new roles for headteachers. The theme underpinning educational policy was that transformational and systemic change was identified as necessary due to: •	The 'standards' plateau at the end of KS 2. •	The need to provide a suitable workforce for the knowledge economy. •	The problem of succession management caused by the retirement of the 'baby boomer' generation and a reluctance of aspirant leaders to apply for headship. Calls for system redesign were partly predicated on recognition of the importance of the role of the headteacher in leading and delivering the reforms in schools. This has led to changes in the role of the headteacher. Themes underpinning that change were: •	The opportunities for new internal and external roles. •	The leadership skills and practice required to manage change effectively. The research design is qualitative involving semi-structured interviews of 21 primary headteachers, over two rounds of interviews from 2005 - 2008. The headteachers from nine different Local Authorities and different contexts were purposively sampled because of their validation as very good, excellent or outstanding leaders in their latest Ofsted inspections. In the second round heads were also sampled for the degree to which they had a new internal or external role. My research suggests that government policy has led to opportunities imposed on or offered to headteachers to undertake new roles. New internal roles include co-leadership and managing a children's centre on site and external roles include system leadership such as the roles of National Leader of Education and other forms of executive headship, and School Improvement Partner and Consultant Leader. In addition there are other extemalleadership roles in networks and with non government <b>departmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> System redesign has led to new roles for other staff and new ways of working in order for the headteachers to build the capacity in their schools to manage their new roles. However they can only do this while maintaining their Ofsted rating as effective leaders and so the impact of accountability and performativity is crucial. This leads to a managed compliance to the educational policy agenda for accountability made more critical due to the increased public reputation they experience. Despite this there is evidence of courage to lead particularly in those areas which have not yet been incorporated into governmental micro-management within the school system. My results consider implications for the system as a whole and in particular with regards to system leadership...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} missing or {{incomplete}} information arises in many National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations provide some guidance on how to address incomplete information at 40 C. F. R. § 1502. 22, but this provision {{can be difficult to}} interpret and is frequently misapplied. <b>Departmental</b> and <b>agency</b> implementing regulations tend to provide little instructions regarding {{missing or incomplete}} information, and there is scant applicable case law. Federal agencies and NEPA practitioners are left with inadequate guidance on this difficult and often controversial issue. Uncertainty about how to address missing or incomplete information can weaken NEPA analyses, obfuscate important environmental issues and also undermine the legal defensibility of NEPA documents and the agency decisions they support. This paper proposes a systematic process for addressing incomplete information in Environmental Impact Statements developed pursuant to NEPA. This solution flows from careful interpretation of relevant provisions of NEPA and CEQ regulations, in particular CEQ regulations at 40 C. F. R. § 1502. 22. The product of this effort is a sequential process that is simple enough to illustrate in the form a flow chart, yet expansive enough to contemplate the full spectrum of missing or incomplete information that may be encountered in an EIS process.
