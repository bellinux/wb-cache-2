25|$|<b>The</b> lymph <b>drained</b> from <b>the</b> bladder {{begins in}} a series of {{networks}} throughout the mucosal, muscular and serosal layers. These then form three sets of vessels: one set near <b>the</b> trigone <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the bladder; one set <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> top of the bladder; and another set <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> outer undersurface of the bladder. The majority of these vessels <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> external iliac lymph nodes.|$|R
50|$|The Limpach {{river valley}} near Limpach {{has always been}} marshy. The first attempt to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> valley was in the 15th century though it had limited success. In 1746-47 and 1790-91 the first canals were built to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> marshs. The {{municipality}} along with the Cantons of Bern and Solothurn undertook a major project in 1939-51 to completely <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> valley and channel the river. In 1984 two pumping stations were built to help <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Limpachmoos marsh.|$|R
5|$|The Fool's Gold Loaf {{begins with}} a loaf of French white bread that is covered in two tablespoons of {{margarine}} and baked in the oven at 350F/180C until brown.

5|$|The upper {{basin of}} the St. Johns was {{significantly}} lowered in the 1920s {{with the establishment}} of the Melbourne Tillman drainage project. This <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> St. Johns' headwaters eastward to the Indian River through canals dug across the Ten-Mile Ridge near Palm Bay. As of 2015, these past diversions are being partially reversed through {{the first phase of the}} Canal 1 Rediversion project.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, in August, he {{captured}} Velizh in September {{he participated in}} the siege of Velikiye Luki, and then took Zavoloc. On 11 August 1581 he received the nomination for the post of Grand Crown Hetman; this nomination, although uncontroversial at that time, was technically illegal. Following that he participated in the long and inconclusive Siege of Pskov, which ended with the Peace of Yam-Zapolsky in 1582. Though Zamoyski failed to capture Pskov, he <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> Russian resources, and the ongoing siege was {{a major reason for}} the final treaty, which was highly favorable to Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first <b>drained.</b> <b>The</b> introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending {{them out to the}} frontier every three years <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that <b>drains</b> into <b>the</b> right atrium, {{and receives}} most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (<b>draining</b> <b>the</b> back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (<b>draining</b> <b>the</b> bottom of {{the left and right}} ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> front of the right ventricle and <b>drain</b> directly into <b>the</b> right atrium.|$|R
50|$|In females, <b>the</b> pampiniform plexus <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> ovaries. <b>The</b> right ovary <b>drains</b> from <b>the</b> plexus to the ovarian vein {{and then}} to the {{inferior}} vena cava. However, <b>the</b> left ovary <b>drains</b> from <b>the</b> plexus to the left ovarian vein, and from there <b>drains</b> to <b>the</b> left renal vein before emptying into the inferior vena cava.|$|R
50|$|In 1877 workers {{began to}} <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> lakes at Kaitangata. The {{community}} hoped that by <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> lakes {{a source of}} flooding which plagued the area would be removed.|$|R
5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake <b>drained,</b> <b>the</b> phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} and actions {{are controlled by}} the Force Gauge, an energy meter which determines how long special skills can be active. Once <b>drained,</b> <b>the</b> skill cannot be activated until the meter refills, which it does during battles. Four skills can be equipped for each character. After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP can be transferred between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E

5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg {{commanded}} the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed {{the force of}} General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging Hüningen, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well-placed. On 27 November, Fürstenberg's chief engineer opened and <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. Fürstenberg offered {{the commander of the}} bridgehead, General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, Fürstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. Fürstenberg maintained the Siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had <b>drained.</b> <b>The</b> shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
5|$|The Weald Clay {{formation}} {{consists of}} sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) in age, about 130–125 million years old. The B.walkeri holotype {{was found in}} the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marsh. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods Mantellisaurus, Iguanodon, and small sauropods. Other vertebrates include sharks (such as Hybodus), bony fishes (including Scheenstia), crocodiles, and pterosaurs. Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including Valditermes, Archisphex, and Pterinoblattina. Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants Weichselia and the aquatic, herbaceous Bevhalstia were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.|$|E
50|$|King's Sedgemoor Drain, {{originally}} {{constructed in}} 1797-8, proved inadequate for <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> village of Chedzoy's moors, so in 1861 the Chedzoy Internal Drainage District built a small pumping {{station on the}} River Parrett, in Westonzoyland parish, to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Chedzoy moors southwards.|$|R
