5|$|Thurisind, in {{observance}} {{of the laws}} of hospitality, received Alboin and his companions and organized a banquet in their honour, offering Alboin the place where his dead son habitually sat. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother Cunimund and Alboin's rejoinder, a clash was avoided by Thurisind's intervention, who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod's arms. According to István Boná, who believes in the veracity of the story, the event may have taken place as described by Paul, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.|$|E

Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen {{is one of the few}} contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.|$|E
25|$|A broad {{consensus}} amongst fans is {{that the}} Star Trek franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s due to over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of TOS felt <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> be formulaic and repetitive). The release in May 2009 of Star Trek, a reboot involving characters from the original series and set in an alternate timeline, was developed with the partial hope to resurrect the franchise.|$|E

25|$|A Committee of Experts deemed Brussels {{to be the}} {{one option}} to have all the {{necessary}} features for a European capital: a large, active metropolis, without a congested centre or poor quality of housing; good communications with other member states' capitals, including to major commercial and maritime markets; vast internal transport links; an important international business centre; plentiful housing for European civil servants; and an open economy. Furthermore, it was located on the border between the two major European civilisations, Latin and Germanic, and was at the centre of the first post-war integration experiment: the Benelux. As a capital of a small country, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> not claim to use the presence of institutions to exert pressure on other member states, it being more of a neutral territory between the major European powers. The Committee's report was approved of by the Council, Parliament and Commissions, however the Council was still unable to achieve a final vote on the issue and hence put off the issue for a further three years despite all the institutions now leading in moving to Brussels.|$|E
500|$|The {{great auk}} was {{generally}} an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater. While swimming, {{the head was}} held up but the neck was drawn in.

Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. The great auk was capable of accelerating under water, then shooting out of the water to land on a rocky ledge above the ocean's surface.|$|E
500|$|Michelson {{directed}} various efforts {{pertaining to}} future transportation. His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research {{began to focus}} almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those {{with the power of}} flight. [...] He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS). [...] One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound ducted fan design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system. [...] <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use. [...] Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of global positioning system (GPS) reference signals. [...] Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a micro air vehicle (MAV) known as the entomopter. [...] The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for slow flight in Mars' lower atmosphere.|$|E

[...] According to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [...] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the Internet, this music has become {{perhaps the most important}} tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits." [...] An article in Popular Music and Society says [...] "musicians believe not only that music could be a successful vehicle for their specific ideology but that <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> advance the movement by framing it in a positive manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1914, he was {{appointed}} as dean to Semeliškės, a town about [...] west of Vilnius. The reasons for the assignment are not clear – {{there is some evidence}} that Steponavičius requested the transfer due to poor health, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> have been a retribution for his Lithuanian activities. In May 1915, during World War I, he was drafted to the Imperial Russian Army as a military chaplain and was sent to the Caucasus Campaign. Stationed in Tbilisi, he joined Lithuanian activities and managed to establish regular Lithuanian-language services in one of the Armenian churches. Sometime between 1916 and 1918, he returned to Semeliškės.|$|E

2500|$|With ELP, Emerson {{added the}} Moog synthesiser behind the C-3 with the {{keyboard}} and ribbon controller stacked {{on the top}} of the organ. The ribbon controller allowed Emerson to vary pitch, volume or timbre of the output from the Moog by moving his finger up and down the length of a touch-sensitive strip. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> be used as a phallic symbol, which quickly became a feature of the act. He continued to divide his keyboard setup into two banks so that he could play between them with his body in view. When the Moog Minimoog first appeared it was placed where needed, such as on top of the grand piano. A Hohner clavinet was also part of Emerson's keyboard rig, but according to Emerson was only used for one song, [...] "Nutrocker".|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev was {{the subject}} of a cover story for an August 2013 issue of Rolling Stone {{entitled}} [...] "The Bomber: How a Popular, Promising Student Was Failed by His Family, Fell into Radical Islam and Became a Monster." [...] The magazine drew large amounts of criticism for the flattering photo of Tsarnaev used for the issue's cover. Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover [...] "rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment". Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy stated that [...] "glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." [...] The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that their offense-taking was the result of their associating Rolling Stone with glamor instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, [...] "because everyone knows the Times is a news organization. Not everyone knows that about Rolling Stone... because many people out there understandably do not know that Rolling Stone is also a hard-news publication." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll be listening to because you want to hear great production. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, and you can tell he genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
