40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the basic}} {{structure}} of typical high-pressure gear pump, a new kind of high-pressure gear pump was designed and applied in water hydraulic transmission system. In this design, the floating plate of typical gear pump is ceramiclized to improve its wear-resisting property; the balance chamber was used to brace and lubricate the axle. Furthermore, the radial unbalanced force induced by the pressure difference of input and output is balanced by the structure of balance chamber. The dynamic characteristic of gear pump is improved and the axel wear is reduced. By using tip relief of tooth <b>flank</b> <b>profile</b> modification, the leakage rate of gear flank is effectively reduced, and the volume efficiency is improved. Water hydraulic transmission will be potentially applied in multi field with the advantage of its safe, non-pollution, clean, cheap and energy resource saving. All kinds of component applied in the water hydraulic transmission system is belong to green product, and will be the main researching and developing direction. So, developing water hydraulic transmission technology is one of the importan...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an image {{registration}} approach {{to cope with}} inter-image illumination changes of arbitrary shape in order to monitor the development of micro-pitting in transmission gears. Traditional image registration approaches do not typically account for inter-image illumination variations that negatively affect the geometric registration precision. Given a set of captured images of gear surface degradation with different exposure times and geometric deformations, {{the correlation between the}} resulting aligned images is compared to a reference one. The presented image registration approach is used with an online health monitoring system involving the analysis of vibration, acoustic emission and oil debris to follow the development of micro-pitting in transmission gears. The proposed monitoring system achieves more registration precision compared to competing systems. This paper experimentally validates the system's capabilities to detect early gear defects and reliably identify the gradual development of micro-pitting in gears, so that it could be used in predictive health monitoring (PHM) systems and overcome the disadvantages of the most commonly used methods, such as gear <b>flank</b> <b>profile</b> scanning, replica sample analysis and conventional image analysis...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{fatigue failure}} occurs in geared {{transmission}} systems due to {{factors such as}} high contact stress, and monitoring its progression is vital if the eventual failure of the tooth flank is to be prevented. Techniques involving the analysis of vibration, acoustic emission and oil debris {{have been used to}} successfully monitor the progression of the different phases of gear surface fatigue failure. However, during monitoring a suitable assessment method is required to correlate the characteristics of the signal with the condition of the gear surface. The most commonly used such methods are gear <b>flank</b> <b>profile</b> scanning, replica sample analysis and conventional image analysis, with each technique having both advantages and disadvantages. Responding to the demand for effective assessment methods, this study experimentally evaluates the development of micro-pitting in gears using a new image registration technique in an online health monitoring system. Given a set of captured images of gear surface degradation with different exposure times and geometric deformations, an image registration approach is proposed to cope with inter-image illumination changes of arbitrary shape. Then correlation between the resulting aligned images is compared to a reference one before testing obtained. The results validate the system's capabilities to detect early gear defects and reliably identify the gradual development of micro-pitting in gears, so that it could be used in predictive health monitoring (PHM) systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} surface {{generation}} model {{based on a}} fast and comprehensive time domain solution which simulates regenerative vibrations {{as well as an}} interaction of cross edge and <b>flank</b> <b>profiles</b> with the undulation of machined surface. Depending on the profiles of the cutter geometry, the damping forces affect the stability of the milling processes which results in variations of the machined surface profile even under the same cutting conditions. By simulating dynamic cutter center affected by shearing and damping forces, runout, and feed motions, the time-dependent angular positions of the edge profiles can be precisely located, which are used to calculate the dynamic uncut chip thickness and the intersection area of the edge profiles against the surface undulation. As the cutting edges interacts with the machined surfaces, the positions of the edges are extracted and connected to form machined surface profiles. The simulated surface profiles are compared with the experimental ones by considering the damping effect depending on the cross edge and <b>flank</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{sedimentation}} rates within Galveston bay, TX, {{and their}} utility in estimating differential compaction in Texas coastal plain estuaries. Most modern Texas estuaries are situated over incised Pleistocene paleo-channels up to 30 m deep, filled primarily with unconsolidated mud-dominated Holocene fluvial and estuarine deposits. The Galveston Pier 21 tidal gauge has a 100 -year record which has recorded a relative sea-level rise rate 3 times the global average, and this rate {{is considered a}} regional rate. However, Pier 21 is situated over the Trinity River incised paleo-valley (TRIV). A CHIRP sub-bottom profile and multiple transects of vibra-cores were collected across the TRIV to investigate if sedimentation resulting from enhanced subsidence has increased over the TRIV compared to the TRIV <b>flanks.</b> <b>Profiles</b> of Hg and textural changes were used alongside sedimentation rates derived from excess ???Pb activity to determine the recent sedimentary history of the bay. Sedimentation rates ranged from 0. 34 ? 1. 48 cm yr??, with the highest rate being found directly over the TRIV. Correlations in Hg and textural data reveal a general deepening and extension of strata within cores collected directly over the TRIV. Analyses of the CHIRP line also reveals a localized thickening of individual stratigraphic layers within Holocene estuarine fill across the TRIV, with a thinning on the flanks. Taken together, {{the evidence suggests that}} differential compaction of the unconsolidated Holocene estuarine fill within the TRIV has produced localized, elevated sedimentation rates, suggesting enhanced localized subsidence up to four times as great within Trinity Bay over the TRIV, than in areas adjacent to it...|$|R

The paper puts forward a new process to honing gear with globoid honing worms on hobbing machines. First the globoid honing worm is profiled by diamond dressing gears, which has the same geometric parameters with the machined gears. Then the profiled globoid honing worm is used to hone workpieces. Both the profiling process and honing process are implemented on same hobbing machines. Meshing and Tooth contact analysis of globoid honing worm profiling has been considered.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between velocity field and isochrone geometry along a steady flowline of an ice sheet is examined. The method is analytical and {{based upon the}} stream function and its vertically normalized form, the normalized stream function (NSF). We show that {{the slope of the}} isochrones is the slope of the iso-NSF lines, plus a path term which is the cumulative result of the past trajectory of the ice particles. We illustrate this path term in three different examples: varying basal melting, varying basal sliding (Weertman effect) and varying velocity profile around a divide (Raymond effect). The path term generally counteracts the slope of the iso-NSF lines. In the case of the Raymond effect, it can even lead to depressions surrounding the bumps if the transition from dome to <b>flank</b> velocity <b>profile</b> is sufficiently abrupt...|$|R

Relief of a female figure (Athena?) <b>flanked</b> by <b>profiles</b> of two men. Text on the commemoration throughout bottom half. Hardly any monument has a more colorful history than the Neptune Fountain [Neptunbrunnen] in Nuremberg. It was built by Christoph Ritter and Georg Schweigger in 1650 - 1660 as a monument to peace {{after the end of}} the Thirty-Year War, cast from melted canons. The city of Nuremberg subsequently ran out of money to install the complicated water mechanism and installed the monument as a sculpture, until it was sold to Czar Paul I of Russia in 1797. It was installed at the Peterhof (Petrodvodets), the summer residence of the Russian czars, near Petersburg. In 1895, the city of Nuremberg decided to purchase back the fountain from Russia, but Czar Alexander II declined, permitting, however, the fountain to be copied. With {{the sponsorship}} of Ludwig Gerngros (1839 - 1916), a Jewish merchant and philanthropist, a copy of the Neptune Fountain was inaugurated in 1902. The coin commemorates this important event in the history of the city of Nuremberg. Updated recordDigital imag...|$|R
40|$|The wear of {{star wheel}} teeth is an {{importance}} {{issue in the}} single screw compressor. In order to enhance the wearresistance of star wheel teeth, some new profiles of the meshing pair were proposed to replace the currently used straight line envelope profile, such as single column envelope, multi-straight line (or multi-column) envelope. In this paper, a curved surface of the tooth flank is suggested. The groove flank is the envelope surface corresponding to the curved surface of the tooth <b>flank.</b> Section <b>profile</b> of the new tooth flank is a curved line, which could be elliptical, hyperbolic or involute. During the tooth meshing with the groove, the contact line between the tooth flank and the groove flank could {{move back and forth}} in the whole area of the tooth flank. This design is expected to improve the lubricating between the tooth flank and the groove flank, and to prolong the service life of the single screw compressor. Geometric and kinematic investigation of the star wheel and the screw rotor is established. And a new designed tooth flank of the meshing pair is introduced in this paper. Numerical control high-velocity cutting technology is suggested to fabricate the new star-wheel and the screw rotor...|$|R

This new version faced away from the Mundo Perdido and possessed a single room with five doorways that faced onto the adjacent Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. Around AD 700, this version was sealed and a new version was built on top, at which time it became one of the highest structures in the Mundo Perdido.

40|$|A morphometric {{analysis}} of north-south trending graben at 35 deg N in northern Tharsis {{is used to}} provide the first quantitative measurements of crustal extension in and strain for areas of the Martian crust that have undergone both extreme and mild deformation. These estimates also demonstrate {{the viability of the}} Viking data for making such quantitative assessment. Graben in the region accommodate about 8 km of post Early Amazonian east-west extension. This extension corresponds to a net regional strain of 0. 45 - 0. 61 percent; local strains vary from less than 1 percent to 5 percent. Extension is nonuniform and localized near 110 deg (south of Alba Patera and north of Ceraunius Fossae) because of reactivation of preexisting fractures in underlying basement and possibly due to superposition of stress fields from Tharsis and Alba Patera. A major mechanical discontinuity in the shallow crust, probably representing the base of or a strength contrast within the megaregolith, is observed. It occurs at a depth of 2 km on the <b>profile</b> <b>flanks</b> and is depressed to about 7. 5 km near 110 deg due to loading of the crust by the volcano...|$|R

40|$|Imaging {{spectroscopy}} of {{the solar}} atmosphere using the Na i D 1 line yields marked asymmetry between the blue and red line wings: sampling a quiet-Sun area in the blue wing displays reversed granulation, whereas sampling in the red wing displays normal granulation. The Mg i b 2 line of comparable strength does not show this asymmetry, nor does the stronger Ca ii 8542 Å line. We demonstrate the phenomenon with near-simultaneous spectral images in Na i D 1, Mgi b 2, and Caii 8542 Å from the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope. We then explain it with line-formation insights from classical 1 D modeling and with a 3 D magnetohydrodynamical simulation combined with NLTE spectral line synthesis that permits detailed comparison with the observations in a common format. The cause of the imaging asymmetry is the combination of correlations between intensity and Dopplershift modulation in granular overshoot and the sensitivity to these of the steep <b>profile</b> <b>flanks</b> of the Na i D 1 line. The Mg i b 2 line has similar core formation but much wider wings due to larger opacity buildup and damping in the photosphere. Both lines obtain marked core asymmetry from photospheric shocks in or near strong magnetic concentrations, less from higher-up internetwork shocks that produce similar asymmetry in the spatially averaged Ca ii 8542 Å profile...|$|R

40|$|The {{lamination}} and burrowing {{patterns in}} 17 box cores were analyzed {{with the aid}} of X-ray photographs and thin sections. A standardized method of log plotting made statistical analysis of the data possible. Several 'structure types' were established, although it was realized that the boundaries are purely arbitrary divisions in what can sometimes be a continuous sequence. In the transition zone between marginal sand facies and fine-grained basin facies, muddy sediment is found which contains particularly well differentiated, alternating laminae. This zone is also characterized by layers rich in plant remains. The alternation of laminae shows a high degree of statistical scattering. Even though a small degree of cyclic periodicity could be defined, it was impossible to correlate individual layers from core to core across the bay. However, through a statistical handling of the plots, zones could be separated {{on the basis of the}} number of sand layers they contained. These more or minder sandy zones clarified the bottom reflections seen in the records of the echograph from the area. The manner of facies change across the bay, suggests that no strong bottom currents are effective in the Eckernförde Bay. The marked asymmetry between the north and south <b>flanks</b> of the <b>profile</b> can be attributed to the stronger action of waves on the more exposed areas. Grain size analyses were made from the more homogeneous units found in a core from the transition-facies zone. The results indicate that the most pronounced differences between layers appear in the silt range, and although the differences are slight, they are statistically significant. Layers rich in plant remains were wet-sieved in order to separate the plant detritus. This was than analyzed in a sediment settling balance and found to be hydrodynamically equivalent to a well-sorted, finegrained sand. A special, rhythmic cross-bedding type with dimensions in the millimeter range, has been named 'Crypto-cross-lamination' and is thought to represent rapid sedimentation in an area where only very weak bottom currents are present. It is found only in the deepest part of the basin. Relatively large sand grains, scattered within layers of clayey-silty matrix, seem to be transported by flotation. Thin section examination showed that the inner part of Eckernförder Bay carbonate grains (e. g. Foraminifera shells) were preserved throughout the cores, while in the outer part of the bay they were not present. Well defined tracks and burrows are relatively rare in all of the facies in comparision to the generally strongly developed deformation burrowing. The application of special measures for the deformation burrowing allowed to plot their intensity in profile for each core. A degree of regularity could be found in these burrowing intensity plots, with higher values appearing in the sandy facies, but with no clear differences between sand and silt layers in the transition facies. Small sections in the profiles of the deepest part of the bay show no bioturbation at all...|$|R
