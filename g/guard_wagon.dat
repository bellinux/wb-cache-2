5000|$|During the Gettysburg Campaign, the 2nd Vermont Brigade {{was one of}} four brigades {{sent from}} the Capital to join the Army of the Potomac as it pursued Robert E. Lee into Pennsylvania. Stannard's command left the Washington {{defenses}} on June 25. Marching 18 miles a day for a week, the brigade reported to the 3rd Division of the I Corps. The I Corps had fought, and lost, heavily in {{the first day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. Three regiments of Stannard's men arrived only after the fighting ceased that day, adding to the division's depleted ranks. (The other two regiments, the 12th and 15th Vermont, had been detached to <b>guard</b> <b>wagon</b> trains.) ...|$|E
25|$|About 6:00p.m., Meade {{learned that}} Pickett in fact was pushing Sheridan back to Dinwiddie Court House. Meade ordered Warren {{to send a}} force to Sheridan down the Boydton Plank Road. Warren sent three regiments of Bartlett's brigade which had been <b>guarding</b> <b>wagons</b> to Sheridan down the Boydton Plank Road.|$|R
25|$|U.S. troops built a {{temporary}} fort near Pyramid Lake, {{then moved to}} the more permanent Fort Churchill, which <b>guarded</b> the <b>wagon</b> trail from the east.|$|R
60|$|Burnside {{had three}} divisions, {{but one of}} them--a colored division--was sent to <b>guard</b> the <b>wagon</b> train, {{and he did not}} see it again until July.|$|R
5000|$|On July 20, Red Cloud's warriors {{attacked}} a wagon train of 37 soldiers and civilians, killing two, at Crazy Woman Fork of the Powder River. After they attacked other civilian wagon trains, nearly all civilian {{traffic on the}} Bozeman Trail ceased. Carrington could only be re-supplied with food and ammunition by heavily <b>guarded</b> <b>wagon</b> trains. In {{the weeks and months}} that followed, the Indians repeatedly attacked the wagon trains that sallied out of Fort Kearny to cut construction timber in a forest six miles away. For defense, the wood trains were large, consisting of two parallel lines of 24 to 40 <b>wagons</b> <b>guarded</b> by mounted soldiers on either flank. In the event of an attack, the wagons were quickly drawn into an corral for defense. [...] Fifteen Indian attacks near Fort Kearny between July 16 and September 27 resulted in the deaths of 6 soldiers and 28 civilians and the loss of several hundred horses, mules, and cattle. Carrington's hay-cutting machine was also destroyed.|$|R

500|$|A {{different}} {{group of}} about 300 men, called the Totenjuden ("Jews of death"), {{lived and worked in}} Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. For the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after gold teeth had been extracted. Once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal. Each trainload of [...] "deportees" [...] brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily <b>guarded</b> <b>wagons.</b> They were divided into three sets of twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the Sonderkommandos to be exchanged for the next set of twenty wagons.|$|R

50|$|Frederick VI, whose forces shrank to 2,500, ordered some {{units to}} <b>guard</b> the <b>wagons,</b> while the {{remaining}} regiments took {{positions at the}} edge of a forest, waiting for the attacking Poles with loaded muskets. Since Swedish troops stood in front of the forest, it was impossible for the Poles to encircle them, and frontal attack was the only solution.|$|R
5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} {{prepared}} for what {{was seen as an}} inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily <b>guarded</b> <b>wagon</b> train to the town of Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|R
5000|$|Violence {{broke out}} and {{continued}} almost daily until mid-July. Riots occurred on April 7 when Montgomery Ward attempted to use wagons driven by strikebreakers to deliver {{raw materials and}} finished goods. The most serious that day involved 1,000 striking workers and sympathizers, who attacked several heavily <b>guarded</b> <b>wagons</b> on Union Street. On April 29, a crowd of 1,000 striking workers and sympathizers clashed with police, and three people were shot and two stabbed. Mayor Dunne immediately banned the carrying of firearms. On May 4, a riot involving more than 5,000 people coursed through the city's streets. Strikers hurled bricks and stones, and assaulted any African American or wagon driver caught on the streets. Police, strikers and strikebreakers used clubs and firearms against one another. During a stone-throwing melee on the Rush Street bridge, strikebreakers opened fire on striking workers, leading to one death. [...] "Slugging"—the beating of non-union workers or union members who crossed picket lines—became common.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Valverde is {{considered}} a Confederate victory. However, the New Mexico Volunteers, {{under the command of}} Colonel Miguel Pino, found the Confederates' lightly <b>guarded</b> supply <b>wagons</b> and burned them. Sibley was forced to march further north without the supplies he had hoped to take from Fort Craig. On February 23, 1862, the Confederate forces marched around the Union Army and headed for Albuquerque.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Lieutenant Cyrus H. Walker and the men of Company B were {{responsible}} for disarming friendly Indians and <b>guarding</b> numerous <b>wagon</b> trains as they crossed southern Idaho. They also established Camp Reed at Salmon Falls Creek and Camp Wallace at Camas Prairie, both in Idaho. The troops built a blockhouse at Camp Wallace, but later abandoned the site in favor of winter quarters near Fort Hall.|$|R
25|$|An obedience-trained Dalmatian dog also {{travels with}} each hitch, a Budweiser {{tradition}} since the 1950s. Historically, {{the role of}} the dogs was to <b>guard</b> the <b>wagon</b> and protect the team while the driver went inside buildings to make deliveries. When the team performs today, the Dalmatians sit on the wagon, seated next to the driver. The wagons are Studebaker wagons modified to carry beer, originally manufactured circa 1900.|$|R
50|$|The Dalmatian is also associated, {{particularly}} in the United States, with Budweiser beer and the Busch Gardens theme parks, since the Anheuser-Busch company's iconic beer wagon, drawn {{by a team of}} Clydesdale horses, is always accompanied by a Dalmatian carriage dog. The company maintains several teams at various locations, which tour extensively. Dalmatians were historically used by brewers to <b>guard</b> the <b>wagon</b> while the driver was making deliveries.|$|R

2500|$|The Lynchburg stage road, about [...] {{north of}} the {{railroad}} station, was the main route between Appomattox Court House and Lynchburg that was available to Lee's army. Near Appomattox Station, along the Lynchburg road, the Confederates had parked a hospital train, {{a large group of}} wagons and about 100 artillery pieces. A small infantry unit, mostly armed artillerymen, and the 500-man cavalry detachment of Brigadier General Martin Gary's command <b>guarded</b> the <b>wagon</b> park.|$|R
50|$|The wagon trains were on {{the right}} flank of the {{soldiers}} of Lee's army, heading for a crossing of Sailor's Creek at Perkinson's mill, near the Creek's confluence with the Appomattox River. The troops planned to cross the river about 2 mi higher up {{on the road to}} Rice's Station. Ewell's corps did not leave Amelia Springs until 2:00 p.m. in order to <b>guard</b> the <b>wagons</b> but moved ahead of them and close up with Anderson's corps when they did move out.|$|R
500|$|As the Union cavalry {{was driven}} back toward Dinwiddie Court House, Capehart's 3rd Brigade was {{recalled}} from duty <b>guarding</b> the <b>wagon</b> train. They moved near what would soon become the front, an open area {{in front of}} Dinwiddie. Capehart's brigade, sometimes called the [...] "Virginia Brigade", used rails from a fence to quickly build a protective area for fighting while dismounted. The men in the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, {{along with the rest}} of the 3rd Brigade, were able to halt the Confederate attack in fighting that continued until after dark.|$|R
2500|$|At dawn on April 1, 1865, Custer {{reported}} to Sheridan that his scouts {{had found that}} the Confederates had withdrawn from their positions {{in front of the}} line confronting the final Union defensive line set up on the evening of March 31 about [...] north of Dinwiddie Court House. After Pickett's withdrawal, Sheridan planned to attack the Confederates at Five Forks as soon as possible. Sheridan ordered Merritt to pursue Pickett's force with Custer's and Devin's divisions. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) William Wells's brigade of Custer's division was recalled from <b>guarding</b> the <b>wagon</b> train.|$|R

50|$|The 3rd Brigade marched northward in {{heat and}} {{dust of the}} summer of 1863, halting at Uniontown, Maryland, on June 30. The grueling march had caused many {{to fall out of}} the ranks, joining only when the {{division}} encamped. On July 1, when the division crossed into Pennsylvania, the third brigade was {{at the rear of the}} column, <b>guarding</b> the <b>wagon</b> train. Reaching Gettysburg, Pennsylvania late on July 1, Willard’s command camped along the Taneytown Road behind the Round Tops. Early on July 2, the brigade moved up to Cemetery Ridge, taking a position near the Bryan farm.|$|R
25|$|At the trial, some 100 {{reporters were}} {{seated at the}} press tables. Hundreds more {{gathered}} on the courthouse lawn.

5|$|Sheridan's army reached Dinwiddie Court House on March 29. His {{first two}} {{divisions}} went into camp at that location, while Custer's 3rd Division ({{which included the}} 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment) <b>guarded</b> the <b>wagon</b> trains further back at Malone's Crossing. The 3rd Division's Third Brigade, which included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd West Virginia cavalry regiments, also included the 1st New York (Lincoln) Cavalry. On the next day, Devin's 1st Cavalry Division, and a brigade from Crook's 2nd Division, were sent north toward Five Forks. Their reconnaissance found a strong enemy force led by General George E. Pickett, and the Union cavalry was driven back.|$|R
2500|$|Late in 1846, the United States {{recruited}} ten regiments of regulars {{to launch}} a mission against Vera Cruz and inland to Mexico City. Captain Allen Wood of Carroll County raised a company of Arkansans for the Twelfth Infantry and joined the forces of General Winfield Scott {{in the summer of}} 1847. Wood’s Arkansans fought in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco on August 19 and 20, 1847, on the outskirts of Mexico City. In a matter of weeks, Mexico City fell to Scott’s forces. Shortly thereafter, the surviving Encarnacion prisoners were released. [...] One other company was recruited, that of Captain Stephen Enyart, whose northwest Arkansas troops served at Meir, Mexico, <b>guarding</b> supply <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Confederates at Monett's Ferry {{missed an}} {{opportunity}} to destroy or capture Banks's army. According to General Richard Taylor, the errors made by Bee were as follows: Sending Terrell's Brigade back to Beasley to <b>guard</b> a <b>wagon</b> train [...] "For the safety of which I had amply provided for", taking no steps to artificially increase {{the strength of his}} position, (Presumably by building earthworks or other fortifications), in massing his troops to the center [...] "Where the enemy were certain not to make any decided effort" [...] instead of concentrating on his flanks, and finally, in retreating his entire force 30 miles to Beasley upon being forced back instead of attacking the disorganized Union column.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 28th the army made an early start, and by noon all had crossed except Burnside's corps. This was left on the north side {{temporarily}} to <b>guard</b> the large <b>wagon</b> train. A line was at once formed extending south from the river, Wright's corps on the right, Hancock's in the centre, and Warren's on the left, ready to meet the enemy if he should come.|$|R
25|$|Wells's brigade of Custer's {{division}} {{arrived at}} Dinwiddie Court House with the wagons at 11:00a.m. After Wells allowed {{his men to}} rest until 1:00p.m., they moved up to the battle line to report to Custer. Davies's and Smith's brigades of Crook's division were assigned to <b>guard</b> the <b>wagon</b> trains when Wells's brigade moved forward. One of Davies's regiments was sent to watch the Boydton Plank Road bridge across Stony Creek. Gregg's brigade of Crook's division was sent across Chamberlain's Bed at Fitzgerald's Ford to seize Little Five Forks. That junction controlled the roads {{to the left and}} rear of Custer's division. Gregg sent out patrols to be sure the Confederates could not make a surprise attack on Sheridan's left flank.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Marks' Mills (April 25, 1864) {{occurred}} in present-day Cleveland County, Arkansas {{as part of}} the American Civil War. Confederate Brigadier-General James Fagan, having made a forced march, attacked a train of several hundred <b>wagons,</b> <b>guarded</b> by a brigade of infantry, 500 cavalry, and a section of light artillery under command of Lieutenant Colonel Francis M. Drake of the 36th Iowa, on its way from Camden to Pine Bluff for supplies.|$|R
50|$|As part of Lord Kitchener's strategy, the British {{constructed}} {{lines of}} blockhouses and barbed wire across the veld. The blockhouse lines {{were designed to}} restrict {{the movements of the}} Boer guerillas so they could be trapped by British mobile columns. One line of blockhouses reached from Harrismith to the Tradoux farm, 25 mi east of Bethlehem. To protect the construction, Major General Sir Leslie Rundle deployed four dispersed forces. Rundle with 330 men and one gun <b>guarded</b> the <b>wagon</b> road; the end of the blockhouse line was held by 150 infantry; a 400-man regiment of the Imperial Light Horse lay 13 mi to the east at Elands River Bridge; Major Williams with 550 men, mostly of the 11th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry, a 15-pounder gun and a pom-pom held the 200 ft high Groenkop.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{he had no}} {{experience}} fighting Indians, Fetterman criticized Carrington's defensive posture and expressed contempt about the Indian foes. He allegedly boasted, [...] "Give me 80 men and I can ride through the whole Sioux nation." [...] Many other officers shared Fetterman's feelings. Shortly after Fetterman arrived at Fort Kearny, Carrington gave the captain permission to attempt a night ambush. However, the Indians saw through it and instead stampeded a herd of the cattle {{on the bank of}} the Powder River opposite Fetterman's intended trap. On November 22, Fetterman himself almost fell into an Indian ambush. He had accompanied an escort that <b>guarded</b> a <b>wagon</b> train gathering firewood and construction timber for Fort Kearny. A single Indian appeared, trying to entice the soldiers into chasing him into the woods. Lieutenant Bisbee, commanding the wagon train, sensibly took cover instead of pursuing the bait.|$|R

50|$|The {{regiment}} {{participated in}} the pursuit of Lee's army toward Danville. On April 6, the division marched from Jetersville following a Confederate column <b>guarding</b> a <b>wagon</b> train, which became trapped at the Battle of Sayler's Creek. The bulk of the wagon train was taken along with several hundred prisoners, the Fifty-third arriving on the field {{at the close of the}} battle. The regiment moved out the following morning, crossed the South Side Railroad near High Bridge and over the Appomattox River where they immediately formed line of battle to confront a Confederate rear guard. One man was killed and another wounded in the ensuing Battle of Cumberland Church, which netted over one hundred prisoners, along with supplies and equipment scattered on the Buckingham Road toward Farmville where the Fifty-third bivouacked for the night. For the next two days the regiment marched unopposed until the 9th, when about four miles from Appomattox Court House, it was announced that the Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered. The column halted and camped on the Buckingham Road.|$|R
