40|$|The {{health and}} {{economic}} burden related to cardiovascular diseases is substantial {{and prevention of}} these diseases remains a challenge. There is convincing evidence that high salt intake affects blood pressure {{and the risk of}} cardiovascular diseases. As salt intake is far above the recommended maximum level of intake, salt reduction may help to reduce cardiovascular disease incidence. However, the effect of salt reduction initiatives on intake levels and long-term health is largely unknown. The main aim of the research described in this thesis is to assess salt intake and the potential <b>health</b> impact of <b>salt</b> reduction in the Netherlands and in Europe. This is addressed by estimating the potential effect of salt reduction strategies on salt intake, by monitoring the effect of the ongoing salt reduction initiatives in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2010 on daily salt intake and by projecting the expected long-term <b>health</b> benefits of <b>salt</b> reduction in the Netherlands and Europe.   Firstly, we used data from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2007 - 2010 and the Dutch Food Composition Database 2010 to study the effect of two potential salt reduction scenarios on salt intake from processed foods. In the first scenario, sodium levels in processed foods were reduced towards their minimum feasible sodium level. In the second scenario, foods were substituted by a low-salt alternative within the same food category. This study demonstrated that daily salt intake from foods could be reduced below the recommended maximum intake of 6 g/d, provided these strategies are successfully implemented. Secondly, the effect of the ongoing salt reduction initiatives in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2010 was evaluated. Dutch adults in two cross-sectional studies (n= 317 in 2006 and n= 342 in 2010) collected a single 24 h urine sample. Despite the initiatives of the food industry to reduce sodium levels in processed foods, no statistically significant difference in daily salt intake was observed between 2006 (8. 7 g/d) and 2010 (8. 5 g/d). Thirdly, the long-term <b>health</b> impact of <b>salt</b> reduction was assessed for the Netherlands using the RIVM Chronic Disease Model and for Europe using the Dynamic Model for Health Impact Assessment (DYNAMO-HIA). A two-step approach was used: the effect of salt reduction on blood pressure was estimated, which was subsequently translated into occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Substantial changes in incident stroke (6. 0 %) and acute myocardial infarction (4. 4 %) can be expected in the Netherlands if sodium contents in processed foods were reduced to the minimum feasible level. The potential health impact of population-wide adherence to the salt intake guideline of the World Health Organization (maximum of 5 g/d) ranged for nine European countries between 10. 1 % in Finland to 23. 1 % in Poland for stroke, and between 6. 6 % in Finland to 15. 5 % in Poland for ischemic heart diseases. Finally, a methodological comparison of seven population <b>health</b> models on <b>salt</b> reduction revealed that these models vary in underlying assumptions. We demonstrated that these differences in assumptions may substantially affect the health impact estimates. In conclusion, technologically feasible salt reductions in processed foods or changes in dietary behaviour may, if implemented successfully, lead to a substantial lowering of daily salt intake, and thereby contribute to considerable health gain. Cross-country comparisons of <b>health</b> impact of <b>salt</b> reduction strategies might benefit from more transparency on the necessary assumptions in the various population health impact models for salt reduction used worldwide.    ...|$|R
40|$|Laws {{regulating}} {{the sale of}} poisons and the purity of foods and medicinals imply the existence of methods for detecting offences, and of persons qualified to employ them. The 1804 Stamp Duty Act named 453 proprietary medicines, many of extreme complexity. Synthetic drugs tended to diminish the polypharmacy of earlier days, {{and the rise of}} the <b>health</b> <b>salt</b> trade brought further simplification, but analysis was still made difficult by the practice of substitution. Advertising of nostrums was assiduously developed by Holloway and Beecham. Chemical analysis had its roots in mining for metals. The blowpipe enabled metals to be detected in complex environments. Group analysis developed from the work of Klaproth, Thomson, Rose and Fresenius. The systematic use of H(_ 2) S is due to Berthollet and Gay-Lussac. Analysis of animal and vegetable products was slower to develop: significant stages were destructive distillation, solvent extraction, element tests, melting points, characteristic group reactions, and instrumentation. Positive identification was difficult to achieve. Chemical evidence in poisoning trials was given usually bymedical men: the consequent forensic disasters (Palmer case, 1856, Smethurst case 1859) brought chemical analysis into disrepute. Landmarks in chemical toxicology were Marsh's test for arsenic (1836) and the Stas-Otto method for extracting poisons from stomach contents (1852). Examples of social problems in the chemical detection of poisons were the easy confusion of oxalic acid with Epsom salt, and the prevalence of opium-containing soothing syrups for infants. Apothecaries, druggists and pharmacists concerned themselves with the adulteration of drugs. General chemical analysis was undertaken by such 'practical' chemists as F. Accum. Pharmacists acquired the right to be called chemists: chemistry was often made to appear as a frivolous science. The l 863 Alkali Act and the 1860 Food Act paved the way for the professional analyst.

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} in {{a coastal}} embayment was documented on multiple {{spatial and temporal}} scales. An inlet formed in Chatham Harbor in 1987 {{and as a result}} the primary flood-tidal delta began to migrate. The relationship between the evolution of the tidal inlet and the flood-tidal delta was documented using field studies and spatial analyses of georeferenced aerial photographs. A feedback mechanism was documented such that the migrating flood-tidal delta increases in surface area, which causes the ebb-tidal flow to become more channelized, which in turn allows more intertidal area to be created by flood-tidal currents and further channelizing ebb-tidal flow. As a result of this cycle two outcomes can be reached. First, the flood-tidal delta restricts ebb-tidal flow {{to such an extent that}} a new inlet is formed through the barrier during a storm event. Second, ebb-tidal flow creates channels in the flood-tidal delta, decreasing the surface area of the flood-tidal delta and restarts the cycle. ^ In April 2007 a new inlet formed through Nauset Beach, a barrier spit within the boundaries of Cape Cod National Seashore. This inlet formed during an extratropical storm as did the 1987 inlet. However, the 2007 inlet did not form as a result of increasing hydraulic inefficiency due to spit elongation. The restriction and redirection of the main tidal channel in the central part of the harbor gave rise to conditions that led to the 2007 inlet formation. The placement of dredged material within Chatham Harbor also contributed to that restriction and redirection. ^ A new shoreline proxy for calculating shoreline change in the Pleasant Bay-Chatham Harbor coastal lagoon was developed and tested. Shoreline change not discernible using a traditional shoreline proxy was documented using this new proxy along shorelines with fringing salt marsh.

Actually, a rigorous assessment is impossible because no safety data are available for all double sulfate salts included in the efflorescence.

Accordingly, these salts are not critically hazardous but it is advisable to avoid any kind of exposure to the efflorescence material. Although this material is not volatile, absorption in the human body may occur by inhalation of contaminated dust particles and ingestion via mucociliary clearance [50]. Considering the large specific surface of the efflorescence, this risk should not be ignored at all, particularly if cleaning by mechanical procedures is attempted.|$|R
