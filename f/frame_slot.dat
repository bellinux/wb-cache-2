30|$|Current {{anti-collision}} algorithms can {{be classified}} as aloha-based algorithms and tree-based algorithms. Aloha-based algorithms estimate the number of tags and assign the proper number of slots to reduce the probability of tag collisions. They can be further classified as dynamic <b>frame</b> <b>slotted</b> aloha [1 – 5] and splitting <b>frame</b> <b>slotted</b> aloha [6 – 8]. The major {{difference is that the}} former dynamically adjusts the number of slots allocated for each frame and allows all unrecognized tags to share these slots while the latter splits unrecognized tags into different collision sets and allows each set to use individual slots separately. However, a limitation of aloha-based algorithms is the starvation problem, in which the tag cannot be identified because its responses are constantly colliding with others.|$|R
30|$|In {{an attempt}} to further improve the {{throughput}} of the <b>framed</b> <b>slotted</b> ALOHA, the authors in [6] propose the idea of transmission of several replicas of the same user message within a frame. This idea was further developed in [7], by introducing successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique which considerably increases the throughput of the <b>framed</b> <b>slotted</b> ALOHA. To this end, the receiver first resolves the collision-free packets within a frame. Then, the corresponding interferences of the these packets in other slots are canceled. By doing such, some other time slots may become interference-free which in turn results in resolving new packets. The process of resolving packets through successively canceling the interference continues until either no more time slot becomes interference-free or all the packets in that frame are resolved.|$|R

40|$|Verb {{meanings}} represent construals of events, lexicalizations {{of actual}} happenings in the world: a proper representation of verb meaning has {{to account for}} both the representational content to be ascribed to the verb and for the mechanisms underlying the interaction among verb meanings and event participants in argument realization. Events have associated semantic roles, while syntactic constructions have argument slots to be filled: how do syntax and semantics interact? What are the principles governing argument realization? This thesis, grounded in the Distributional Semantics framework, {{is concerned with the}} automatic extraction of distributional information with regards to the behavior of Italian verbs at the syntax-semantics interface. In the literature this topic is further articulated in different subtasks, deeply related to one another: extraction of subcategorization frames, assignment of selectional preferences to verb arguments in terms of both lexical fillers and semantic classes, semantic role labeling, identification of diathesis alternations, and the automatic extraction of verb classes. The goal of this work is to describe the behavior of verbs in terms of both a syntactic and a semantic distributional profile. The former is composed of the syntactic constructions (subcategorization frames) that best characterize the target verb; the latter is articulated in three subsets: the lexical sets of the words that best fill each <b>frame</b> <b>slot,</b> the semantic classes (selectional preferences) abstracted from these words, and the polysemies built by combining these classes. The “final product” is LexIt, a distributional resource for the study of Italian verbs based on the "La Repubblica corpus": in this database syntactic frames, lexical fillers, semantic classes and polysemies are brought together and scored for their statistical salience for verbs. Distributional data extracted from "La Repubblica" were used to tackle a case study: the behavior of Italian verbs of Manner of Motion at the syntax-semantics interface. The distributional correlates of an existing classification were analysed to shed light on specific issues: the asymmetry between SOURCE and GOAL; the property of MANNER verbs to be modifiers of telic, (and, in particular, boundary crossing) predicates; the property of MANNER verbs to be modified by directional adverbs; the metaphorical uses of these verbs. The linguistic analysis of Manner of Motion verbs has to be considered a part of the actual resource because the applied methodology represents a proposal for the application of Lexit to actual lexical analysis. The first chapter of this thesis tackles the issue of argument realization {{from the point of view}} of both theoretical linguistics and lexicographic resources; the second chapter outlines the distributional methodology applied for data extraction: it provides, for every subtask, an introduction of the linguistic phenomenon to be computationally modeled, a review of the state of the art and a detailed description of the algorithms applied, together with detailed examples of the results; the third chapter goes through the case study described above...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic <b>framed</b> <b>slotted</b> ALOHA (DFSA) {{protocol}} {{has been}} widely used in many RFID systems. According to the information from last frame (e. g. the number of idle, success and collision slots), DFSA dynamically adjusts the next frame size so as to reach higher identification efficiency. The process is known as tag estimation of DFSA. Similar to most existing tag anti-collision protocols, The DFSA initially aims at tag identification in static environments where all tags keep still during the tag identification process. However, in many real scenarios (called mobile RFID systems), tags usually move along a fixed path in the reader coverage area. That is, tags enter and leave the area continuously. This easily leads to serious errors of tag estimation because the tag estimation of almost existing DFSA variants do not consider new arrival tags. The errors in turn cause very low tag identification rate and eventually make some tag leave the area unidentified. In this paper, we propose a grouping based dynamic <b>framed</b> <b>slotted</b> ALOHA protocol (GBDFSA) which is very suitable for mobile RFID systems. Through tag grouping in their arrival time order, the tag estimation algorithm in GBDFSA can eliminate the influence of new arrival tags. Simulation results show that GBDFSA can significantly reduce the numbers of lost tags in mobile RFID systems. The idea of the paper is used in various existing DFSA variants {{so as to make}} these protocols adapt to mobile RFID systems.

Both the FSASeq and BLSync protocols were simulated through sequential and parallel operations of <b>Frame</b> <b>Slotted</b> Aloha (FSA) following respective protocol guidelines presented previously. We consider two realistic tag layout settings: a uniform distribution of tags to study the effect of overlap factor on tag reading time and a geometric distribution of tags to study the effect of both the overlap factor and tag distribution on tag reading time. These can be considered realistic as one setting represents a scenario where tags could be randomly found in different locations within the interrogation zone with equal probability, while the second setting considers a possible clustered layout with tags present in groups. Varying the geometric parameter further allows consideration of various levels of clustering that may be encountered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{identification}} {{based on}} {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) is progressively being introduced into industrial environments, enabling new applications and processes. In the context of communications, RFID rely mostly on <b>Frame</b> <b>Slotted</b> Aloha (FSA) anticollision protocols. Their goal {{is to reduce the}} time required to detect all the tags within range (identification time). Using FSA, the maximum identification rate is achieved when the number of contending tags equals the number of contention slots available in the frame. Therefore, the reader must estimate the number of contenders and allocate that number of slots for the next frame. This paper introduces the new MFML-DFSA anticollision protocol. It estimates the number of contenders by means of a maximum-likelihood estimator, which uses the statistical information from several frames (multiframe estimation) to improve the accuracy of the estimate. Based on this expected number of tags, the algorithm determines the best frame length for the next reading frame, taking into account the constraints of the EPCglobal Class- 1 Gen- 2 standard. The MFML-DFSA algorithm is compared with previous proposals and found to outperform these in terms of (lower) average identification time and computational cost, which makes it suitable for implementation in commercial RFID readers.
