25|$|Borders {{and names}} for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Bureau</b> (IHB), the precusor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then {{published}} these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, {{the first edition}} being 1928. Since the first edition, {{the limits of the}} Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60°S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency and Merriam-Webster. Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia. The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean, depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and on line maps. Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps and GeoNova.|$|E

50|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Bureau</b> was {{established}} in 1921 {{for the purpose of}} providing a mechanism for consultation between governments on such matters as technical standards, safe navigation and the protection of the marine environment. In 1970 the name was changed to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).

5000|$|The International Hydrographic Organization is an {{organization}} that coordinates with member countries over hydrographic issues. One of the organization's functions is to help set international standards on the naming and delineation of nautical regions. In 1929, the organization (then called the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Bureau)</b> published [...] "IHO Special Publication 23" [...] (IHO SP 23), which established {{the name of the}} sea as Sea of Japan; however, at that time, Korea could not participate in the IHO because it was under Japanese rule. [...] South Korea officially joined the IHO in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The first {{international}} organization of oceanography {{was created in}} 1902 as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. In 1903 the Scripps Institution of Oceanography was founded, followed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1930, Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 1938, and later the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, and the School of Oceanography at University of Washington. In Britain, the National Oceanography Centre (an institute of the Natural Environment Research Council) is the successor to the UK's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. In Australia, CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR), is a leading centre. In 1921 the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Bureau</b> (IHB) was formed in Monaco.|$|E
