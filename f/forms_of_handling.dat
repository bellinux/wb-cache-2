SMS- interactions have frequently been studied from a 'monological point of view', looking at single SMS-messages. In this article, we {{will develop a}} dialogically grounded perspective on the interactive dynamics and the social activities constructed in everyday SMS dialogues. Based on SMS data from Chinese and German students, we will argue that - even though production and reception of SMS messages are removed {{in time and space}} - SMS communication represents dialogically oriented social activities. Furthermore, as communicative practices, Chinese as well as German SMS-dialogues reveal features of routinization, grounded in technical prerequisites, in the particular writing systems and linguistic conventions as well as in culture specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> particular social activities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> {{were used}} as {{reinforcement}} in a T-maze for 34 albino rats. In a twelve-day experiment, those receiving gentling learned to avoid reinforcement while those receiving fondling learned to obtain it. In a six-day follow-up, rats were given either a fondling hand or a rat companion as reinforcement. The proportion of reinforced trials and running times were similar for both objects. Rats learned a task to obtain interaction with a rat or responsive surrogate. Werner and Latan 6 (1974) have argued that responsive interaction is an important basis of social attraction in albino rats. They demon-strated that rats were attracted to a responsive fondling human hand, spending upwards of 60 % of a five minute test period in contact with this social surrogate. The kind and amount of interaction was compara-ble to rats behavior with rat companions. This finding conflicts {{with a series of}} studies in which gentling [...] a form of handling similar t...|$|E

The methodology based on the bibliographic research, in which publications, books and monographs, as well as specialized sites were used. This research showed that the contamination of the ground water is the most important environmental problem caused by the inappropriate handling of swine waste and that there are six main types of swine waste handling processes used in Brazil: settling ponds, manure storage tanks, bi- manure storage tanks, bio-digesters, composting and deep bedding. All these types of handling seeking to minimize environmental impacts caused by the swine waste, having no order of importance among them, since the choice of the process is given by the amount of waste produced mainly. In Brazil, the use of manure storage tanks and settling ponds prevails, however among the properties integrated to large food companies there is the use of bio-digesters. The composting and the deep bedding are alternatives less used because they were implemented in Brazil recently...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays user {{involvement}} in design processes often is lacking {{due to the}} growing number of parties and specialists that participate and limited time to deliver the design. As easy {{as it used to be}} in former times for architects to get users involved, as difficult it became nowadays. Lacking user involvement easily might cause function and performance problems afterwards. For a Dutch architectural office that faced important user involvement problems a research project was executed. The goal of the project was to explore the most effective and efficient way to manage user {{involvement in}} the design of multifunctional schools. These are also known as ‘brede school’. The outcomes indicate that for adequate user involvement, specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> such users during the planning, design and realization process is needed. The findings also show that a flexible method that adjusts itself to the different phases and tasks is needed. To that account, a tool for architects getting users involved in the right and adequate way was developed. By using the tool, the architects get an overview on the type of user involvement needed, the frequency of the involvement and the type of user involvement for the next phase in the planning and design and phase. The tool opens in that way the possibility for quick observations and decisions to involve users in the process. The paper finalizes with conclusions and recommendations for further research...|$|E

Therefore, it is responsibility of the veterinary doctor to create studies that generate a real knowledge on topics as the disease prevention within the snail breeding place. This investigation tries to make a sanitary diagnosis in each phase of the biological cycle of the snail Helix aspersa (O. F. Muller, 1774) bred in captivity. It also determines how different environmental factors (temperature, humidity, altitude above sea level, etc.), and different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> can be or no implied in the presentation of any disease. Thus, it identifies and classifies the main pathogenic agents of the land Helix snails in different environmental conditions of regions appropriate for the snail culture in Colombia.

They measure the prevalence of every disease after applying a survey epidemiologist of risks, determining the pathologies related to the presented symptomatology and carrying out a microbiological isolation of the main contained pathogenic agents in each snail breeding place. The most significant pathologies will be documented inside the snail breeding place, based on the analysis of results through associations, and the rates of incidence for each disease, the presented relative risk, and the main factors of risk will be determined. Finally, with suitable breeding practices established after this study, we can foresee {{the presence of these}} alterations in the production of the snail in Colombia...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{traces the}} changing {{history of a}} method fundamental to all current search engines - measuring the authority of a website through its links, and it discusses the perspectives on society underlying this. I start out with references provided by search engine designers on the historical roots of the technologies they use. Then I follow multiple traces on a search to see how these tech-nologies determine authority. I examine concepts of social relationships {{and how they are}} transformed into socio-technical forms of communication that today seem natural. I will refer to three related <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> social relations: 1) Ever since the 1930 s, a "sociometric revolution" has been advocating group-psychological interventions and the visualization of how they are embedded in social structures as a means of self-realization. To this end, mathematical methods were developed that were designed to assign authority directly based on group behavior, without drawing on any prior scheme of classification. 2) Present-day bibliometric methods for developing and surveying the sciences continue this tradition of thought. External references were eliminated in favor of an allegedly politically independent science, and self-referential models aggregating objective authority were developed - e. g. the Impact Factor and the Science Citation Index - both of which soon became bench-marks exercising a strong influence on their objects of measurement. As auto-mation and data archiving progressed, such measuring methods turned into behavioral instructions. 3) Search engines incorporate and expose a particular relationship between social relations and authority, although clear qualitative points of reference are missing. As mediators (and notorious data collectors) search engines produce and represent authority themselves and render this self-referentiality visible. However, this strategy is not only found in search engines, {{it is part of a}} more general tendency of social optimization...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the two main}} practices {{in the management of}} municipal sewage sludge (MSS) in terms of the release of cadmium, which makes it way from waste waters, to the environment and more specifically to the Danish agriculture. Although the amounts of cadmium released from the sludge into Danish agriculture are closely monitored (having decreased greatly in the last couple decades), and are kept broadly under the lawful limit, this project aims at proposing a strategy for limiting its output on a more conditional basis. The two most important ways of treating MSS consist of, in one hand, its incineration in specialized facilities and in the other, its use as field amendment. Further differentiation in these practices has been established depending on the sludge’s geographic and demographic origin, the properties of the exposed soils, and the functions it performs. Both <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> MSS are studied in further detail partially with the help of two specific cases (an urban MSS incinerator and a semi-urban treatment plant that distributes MSS for fertilizing). A system of criteria has been established, in the most objective manner possible, as a way to compare different forms of disposal of the MSS. The analysis of these methods for handling MSS using the established criteria makes up the benefits and risks assessments and gives structure to the discussion, giving the arguments used in proposing a strategy to decrease the release of cadmium from MSS while taking advantage of this waste product. This discussion concludes with a proposal for improvement based on three main ideas. The first idea proposes a new political position to make it a priority to exploit the resources in the sludge as much as possible, encouraging its use as field improvement and its incineration for energy production. The second idea proposes a change in danish legislation: different limit levels of cadmium in MSS used as fertilizer, should be adjusted to the match the properties of the exposed soil. A final idea is to battle the release of cadmium at its sources, reducing the use of it in industries to, ideally, eliminate its presence in our living environment entirely...|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Due to {{advances}} {{in the field of}} medicine, infants born prematurely now have greater chances of survival despite not being carried to Full Term. However, serious health complications exist due to premature birth. Therefore, premature neonates require a specialized form of individualized care. Developmentally supportive care stresses the importance of proper handling, positioning and regular repositioning of the patient. In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) there does not exist a standardized form of care in regards to the proper positioning of these patients. Currently, healthcare providers use rolled blankets, towels or foam positioning barriers and pillows to position and reposition the neonate. However, these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> the neonate require some form of manual intervention which can cause undue stress and harm to the infant’s already fragile and compromised condition. As a result, there exists a need for a novel automated repositioning device that can safely and effectively position the neonate in a slow and controlled manner to ensure that they reach proper developmental milestones {{while at the same time}} preventing any further medical complications. In this study, an automated repositioning device was created. This system employs the use of inflatables to serve as air cells in order to achieve the safe positioning of these patients. The system is comprised of two pumps, four valves and four inflatable air cells that safely and slowly direct the air flow into the desired air cells by means of an Arduino Uno and a multi-directional control switch in order to obtain safe and proper positioning. The four air cells that comprise this system position the patient in either a Fowler’s, Trendelenburg, Left or Right position. Testing was conducted on this automated inflatable repositioning system using a manikin that was similar to the size of a full term infant. Range of motion testing was conducted and it was discovered that this system is successful in achieving a sufficient range of motion in order to safely position the manikin. A pressure sensor was also connected to the system to measure the amount of pressure in the air cells over time during inflation. From this testing, it was found that the system is successful in inflating the air cells in a slow and controlled manner. Additionally, four NICU nurses from the Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women and Children tested the device and a survey was conducted to obtain feedback about the performance of the system. Overall the device created was found to be successful in achieving positions in four directions in a safe, slow and controlled manner by means of an easy to use system that has the potential to be integrated into current neonatal health care technology...|$|E
40|$|Diferentes pesquisas já identificaram dificuldades, entre médicos, de lidar com o morrer humano, mas tais dificuldades estariam associadas a formas mais amplas e coletivas de lidar com o tema. O presente estudo buscou explorar tal perspectiva investigando grupos fora do âmbito dos profissionais da saúde. Dois grupos, cariocas e mineiros, foram entrevistados sobre suas visões e atitudes em relação ao tema morte. Todos na faixa etária 50 - 60 anos, com nível {{superior}} de escolaridade e padrão socioeconômico e cultural semelhantes e sem atuação em áreas relacionadas à saúde. A pesquisa foi de natureza exploratória e a metodologia de análise foi a do discurso do sujeito coletivo - (DSC) que se baseia na teoria da representação social. Os resultados sugeriram diferenças locais e de gênero. Os mineiros incluíram laços familiares e de amizade como elementos da qualidade de vida. Entre as mulheres (cariocas e mineiras) houve referências frequentes a elementos familiares como pai, mãe, avó e tia. No conjunto, cariocas e mineiros expressaram um padrão geral: preferem não pensar na morte, escolhem pensar na qualidade de vida para envelhecer bem. Ainda que o falar sobre a velhice traga relevantes reflexões, a dificuldade do falar sobre a morte revelou-se também nesse deslocamento. Se os médicos se veem hoje tateando caminhos para lidar com os limites da biomedicina, também os investigados encontram-se envolvidos com o uso de tais recursos no enfrentamento da morte.

This research aimed at exploring this perspective and investigated professionals who were not in the health area. Two groups, from the Brazilian States of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, were interviewed on their views and attitudes concerning the theme. All the interviewees were aged between 50 and 60 years, had similar socioeconomic, cultural and educational background (university degree) and none of them had worked in the health field. The research had an exploratory nature and used the Collective Subject Discourse - CSD, which is based on the theory of social representation, for the methodological analysis. The results indicated both local and gender differences. The group from Minas Gerais included family and friendship ties as elements of quality of life. Among women (from both States) there were frequent references to family elements such as father, mother, grandmother and aunt. On the whole, both groups expressed a general pattern: they prefer not to think about death, and they would rather think about quality of life in order to age well. Even though talking about aging brings in relevant reflections, the difficulty in talking about death was also revealed in this displacement. Both doctors and the investigated professionals are facing the anguish that is favored by the theme...|$|E
