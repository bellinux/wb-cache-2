Accordingly, ash postcombustion may still be active during <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> extraction from utility boilers. This phenomenon has been frequently observed in plants equipped with dry ash belt extraction/conveying systems, such as the MAC (Magaldi Ash Cooler) proprietary technology. In the present work a model is presented that describes the fate of ash particles from a PC boiler co-fired with coal and RDF during their fall-out from the boiler and during the subsequent extraction on the belt-conveyor. The physico-chemical properties and the reactivity of ashes have been characterised experimentally. The model deals with the broad distribution of ash particles falling from the furnace on the belt {{and the establishment of}} a polydisperse granular bed on the conveyor. Modelling of heat transfer and combustion in the granular bed of ash is accomplished considering two distinct length- and time-scales: at the macroscale the deposited solids undergo transient heat transfer within the granular bed and with the environment; at the microscale ash particles of different size and temperature exchange heat among themselves, equalising their temperatures. Model results confirm that extensive carbon conversion can be achieved on the belt and that the MAC system can be effectively implemented to operate as a bottom ash afterburner...|$|E

In this investigation three types of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> have been used. There are several factors which affect the dry density of the <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> as: specific gravity, moisture content, compaction energy, layer thickness and mold area.

40|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>ash</b> is {{produced}} by the incineration of household waste. Waste regulations mandate that re-use of this residue be given priority. The goal of the investigations was to devine and test the process conditions of an integrated wet chemical treatment of <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> in a <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> discharger. This should lead to an improved quality of <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes.</b> Easily soluble pollutants and fine particles should be removed by a washing process, and heavy metals of environmental significance should be stabilized {{by the addition of}} gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in one and the same process. To achieve the above objectives, <b>dry</b> raw <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> were removed continuously from three incineration plants, sieved into grain fractions and conditioned. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a glass reactor and a heating water reactor. Pilot-scale experiments were performed in a <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> discharger. Each type of treated and untreated <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> was characterized according to environmental and technical construction material criteria. Results indicated that easily soluble salts and fine particles were removed by the washing of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash.</b> In laboratory experiments, the concentrations of heavy metals in leachates after treatment could be lowered significantly by the addition of gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid. However, in pilot-scale experiments the concentrations of carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in the process fluids were too low, and hence the expected stabilization of heavy metals was not achieved. The chemical reactions of the additives mostly happen in the washing solution. Stabilization can be reached only with a large amount of additives. In the case of phosphoric acid this would constitute a great expenditure of chemicals associated with a decrease in acid neutralization capacity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>ash.</b> After wet chemical treatment all <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes</b> exhibited a significant improvement of technical construction material characteristics. This procedure may be applied without incurring substantial investment costs by retrofitting existing incineration plants to allow on-site washing of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash.</b> In addition the carbon dioxide from the cleaned flue gas can be used to accelerate the aging processes. A stabilization of heavy metals is possible mostly by changing the pH value in the leachates of the treated <b>bottom</b> <b>ashes.</b> The washing solutions could then be used in the washer system of the flue gas cleaning facility.

40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} consume huge {{quantities}} of water, {{and in some}} water-stressed areas, power plants compete with other users for limited supplies. Extensive use of coal to generate electricity is projected to continue for many years. Faced with increasing power demands and questionable future supplies, industries and governments are seeking ways to reduce freshwater consumption at coal-fired power plants. As the United States investigates various freshwater savings approaches (e. g., the use of alternative water sources), other countries are also researching and implementing approaches to address similar - and in many cases, more challenging - water supply and demand issues. Information about these non-U. S. approaches {{can be used to}} help direct near- and mid-term water-consumption research and development (R&D) activities in the United States. This report summarizes the research, development, and deployment (RD&D) status of several approaches used for reducing freshwater consumption by coal-fired power plants in other countries, many of which could be applied, or applied more aggressively, at coal-fired power plants in the United States. Information contained in this report is derived from literature and Internet searches, in some cases supplemented by communication with the researchers, authors, or equipment providers. Because there are few technical, peer-reviewed articles on this topic, much of the information in this report comes from the trade press and other non-peer-reviewed references. Reducing freshwater consumption at coal-fired power plants can occur directly or indirectly. Direct approaches are aimed specifically at reducing water consumption, and they include dry cooling, <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> handling, low-water-consuming emissions-control technologies, water metering and monitoring, reclaiming water from in-plant operations (e. g., recovery of cooling tower water for boiler makeup water, reclaiming water from flue gas desulfurization [FGD] systems), and desalination. Some of the direct approaches, such as dry air cooling, desalination, and recovery of cooling tower water for boiler makeup water, are costly and are deployed primarily in countries with severe water shortages, such as China, Australia, and South Africa. Table 1 shows drivers and approaches for reducing freshwater consumption in several countries outside the United States. Indirect approaches reduce water consumption while meeting other objectives, such as improving plant efficiency. Plants with higher efficiencies use less energy to produce electricity, and because the greater the energy production, the greater the cooling water needs, increased efficiency will help reduce water consumption. Approaches for improving efficiency (and for indirectly reducing water consumption) include increasing the operating steam parameters (temperature and pressure); using more efficient coal-fired technologies such as cogeneration, IGCC, and direct firing of gas turbines with coal; replacing or retrofitting existing inefficient plants to make them more efficient; installing high-performance monitoring and process controls; and coal drying. The motivations for increasing power plant efficiency outside the United States (and indirectly reducing water consumption) include the following: (1) countries that agreed to reduce carbon emissions (by ratifying the Kyoto protocol) find {{that one of the most}} effective ways to do so is to improve plant efficiency; (2) countries that import fuel (e. g., Japan) need highly efficient plants to compensate for higher coal costs; (3) countries with particularly large and growing energy demands, such as China and India, need large, efficient plants; (4) countries with large supplies of low-rank coals, such as Germany, need efficient processes to use such low-energy coals. Some countries have policies that encourage or mandate reduced water consumption - either directly or indirectly. For example, the European Union encourages increased efficiency through its cogeneration directive, which requires member states to assess their national potential for cogeneration, analyze barriers to achieving the potential, and then establish support schemes to achieve the potential. China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006 - 2010) has an energy strategy that specifies, among other things, that production should be optimized by promoting the development of large-scale, high-efficiency units, and that air-cooled technologies should be used in areas with water shortages. The United States lacks many of these drivers. There are no government requirements that mandate more efficient plants. The United States has ample supplies of relatively cheap coal, and U. S. water-short areas are not as extensive as in countries such as China, South Africa, and Australia. Often, other countries have deployed water-savings technologies to a greater degree than the United States...|$|E

The effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> on properties of SCC were investigated by comparing the test results of SCC mixed with <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> {{with those of the}} control SCC made of river sand. Test results revealed that slump flow and L-box passing ability of the SCC mixtures with <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> reduced, while 500 -mm slump flow time (T 500 increased with the increase of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> replacement level. The use of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> resulted in the reduction of compressive strength and caused increase of porosity of hardened concrete.

Lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> is a waste byproduct that is high in alumina and silicates and is therefore a candidate material for replacing aluminosilicate minerals such as clay. The lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> powder {{was obtained from the}} Mae Moh power plant, Thailand. Small brick specimens were produced by die pressing a mixture of lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> ball clay and aluminum hydroxide. The composition of the mixture contained a fixed amount of aluminum hydroxide, while the lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> replaced from 30 to 70 % of the ball clay. The pressed samples were sintered at 1300 ÂºC for 1 hour in air. The density, porosity, strength and thermal properties of the samples were measured. A microstructural analysis of the sintered brick was also performed. It was found that the porosity of the samples increased from 35 to 45 % with increased lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> content. The modulus of rupture and the thermal conductivity of the bricks were reduced with increased lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> content, likely due to the increased amount of porosity. Dilatometric analysis found that the thermal expansion increased with increased amounts of lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> possibly {{as a result of an}} increased amount of glassy phase. Despite the high thermal expansion coefficient at high temperature, the feasibility of using lignite <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> in the insulating brick composition was demonstrated...|$|R
