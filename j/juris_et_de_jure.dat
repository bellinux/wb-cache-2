60|$|Thus it is {{with things}} which owe their {{existence}} to men; but where the subject is of a physical nature, or of a moral nature, independent of their conventions, men have no other reasonable authority than to register and digest the results of experience and observation. Crimes are the actions of physical beings with an evil intention abusing their physical powers against justice and {{to the detriment of}} society: in this case fictions of law and artificial presumptions (<b>juris</b> <b>et</b> <b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> have little or no place. The presumptions which belong to criminal cases are those natural and popular presumptions which are only observations turned into maxims, like adages and apophthegms, and are admitted (when their grounds are established) in the place of proof, where better is wanting, but are to be always over turned by counter proof.|$|E
60|$|The {{rules of}} {{evidence}} in civil and in criminal cases, in law and in equity, being only reason methodized, are certainly the same. Your Committee, however, finds that the far greater part {{of the law of}} evidence to be found in our books turns upon questions relative to civil concerns. Civil cases regard property: now, although property itself is not, yet almost everything concerning property and all its modifications is, of artificial contrivance. The rules concerning it become more positive, as connected with positive institution. The legislator therefore always, the jurist frequently, may ordain certain methods by which alone they will suffer such matters to be known and established; because their very essence, for the greater part, depends on the arbitrary conventions of men. Men act on them with all the power of a creator over his creature. They make fictions of law and presumptions of (præsumptiones <b>juris</b> <b>et</b> <b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> according to their ideas of utility; and against those fictions, and against presumptions so created, they do and may reject all evidence. However, even in these cases there is some restraint. Lord Mansfield has let in a liberal spirit against the fictions of law themselves; and he declared that he would do what in one case[68] he actually did, and most wisely, that he would admit evidence against a fiction of law, when the fiction militated against the policy on which it was made.|$|E
5000|$|A legal {{presumption}} (presumptio juris) is a presumption that is {{stated in the}} positive canon law (ab ipsa lege). Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, {{legal presumption}} was divided into two kinds: juris tantum [...] "which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary", and <b>juris</b> <b>et</b> <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> or absolute presumption {{which can only be}} refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based). This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (juris simpliciter) and the absolute (<b>juris</b> <b>et</b> <b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> was not continued into the 1983 Code of Canon Law and was dropped.|$|E

40|$|Most {{discussions of}} Kripke's Naming and Necessity focus either on Kripke's {{so-called}} "historical theory of reference" or his thesis that names are rigid designators.

5000|$|De facto {{recognition}} of states, rather than <b>de</b> <b>jure,</b> is rare. <b>De</b> <b>jure</b> recognition is stronger, while {{de facto recognition}} is more tentative and recognizes only that a government exercises control over a territory.

Another example {{is the state of}} Israel in 1948, whose government was immediately recognized de facto by the United States and three days later by Soviet <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> recognition. Also, the Republic of China, commonly known as [...] "Taiwan", is generally recognized as de facto independent and sovereign, but is not universally recognized as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> independent due to the complex political status of Taiwan related to the United Nation's de-recognization of it in favor of the People's Republic of China in 1971.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmong other virtues, Mental Files Theory {{provides}} a straightforward explanation of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference, i. e. identity of referent guaranteed by meaning alone: <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference holds between terms when these {{are associated with}} the same mental file from which they inherit their reference. In this paper, I discuss an objection that Angel Pinillos raises against Mental Files Theory and other similar theories: the theory predicts that <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference should be transitive, just like identity. Yet there are cases, involving ‘slash-terms’, in which transitivity fails, or so it seems. In his book Mental Files, Recanati replies that the mental files theorist can accommodate Pinillos’ exceptions by offering a refined model of merging files, the ‘partial merging’ model. While agreeing with Recanati on the need for such a model, I contend that, pace Recanati and Pinillos, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference is transitive even in the presence of slash-terms. I will first show that paradoxical consequences ensue if slash-terms are said to <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> corefer with several basic terms at once. Then, building on two different accounts Recanati gives of referential confusion, I will show that on both views, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference cannot hold because of the behaviour of confused slash-terms. I will conclude that, in Mental Files Theory, a slash-term can, at most, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> corefer with only one basic term per context...|$|R
