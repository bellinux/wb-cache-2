40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of transpiration {{is required to}} estimate the various components of evaporation losses during sprinkler irrigation. Among the methods, sap flow measurements have widely used for direct measurements of transpiration rate in plant. To evaluate the applicability of this method to field experiments involving canopy wetting (by sprinkler irrigation), stem flow measurements were compared with transpiration values estimated from successive mass measurements of small potted plants using pre-calibrated mini-lysimeters in a glasshouse at the University of Southern Queensland, during the period August–October 2010. From this study {{it was found that}} when the canopy was dry, the sap flow measurements mirrored the transpiration rate of plants with reasonable accuracy, overestimating the transpiration rate by about 11 %. The measurements showed no evidence of time lag between sap flow and transpiration. Following wetting of the plant canopy the sap flow declined rapidly reflecting a decline in the transpiration rate transpiration and sap flow.

40|$|Agricultural {{productivity}} {{has increased}} in the Texas High Plains {{at the cost of}} declining water tables, putting at risk the sustainability of the Ogallala Aquifer as a principal source of water for irrigated agriculture. This has led area producers to seek alternative practices that can increase water use efficiency (WUE) through more careful management of water. One potential way of improving WUE is by reducing soil evaporation (E), thus reducing overall evapotranspiration (ET). Before searching for ways to reduce E, it is first important to quantify E and understand the factors that determine its magnitude. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify E throughout part of the growing season for irrigated cotton in a strongly advective semi-arid region; (2) to study the effects of LAI, days after irrigation, and measurement location within the row on the E/ET fraction; and (3) to study the ability of microlysimeter (ML) measures of E combined with sap <b>flow</b> <b>gage</b> measures of transpiration (T) to accurately estimate ET when compared with weighing lysimeter ET data and to assess the E/T ratio.

40|$|The {{homogeneity}} of composition and uniformity of {{temperature of the}} steel melt before it is transferred to the tundish are crucial in making high-quality steel product. The homogenization process is performed by stirring the melt using inert gas in ladles. Continuous monitoring {{of this process is}} important to make sure the action of stirring is constant throughout the ladle. Currently, the stirring process is monitored by process operators who largely rely on visual and acoustic phenomena from the ladle. However, due to lack of measurable signals, the accuracy and suitability of this manual monitoring are problematic. The actual flow of argon gas to the ladle may not be same as the <b>flow</b> <b>gage</b> reading due to leakage along the gas line components. As a result, the actual degree of stirring may not be correctly known. Various researchers have used one-dimensional vibration, and sound and image signals measured from the ladle to predict the degree of stirring inside. They developed online sensors which are indeed to monitor the online stirring phenomena. In this investigation, triaxial vibration signals have been measured from a cold water model which is a model of an industrial ladle. Three flow rate ranges and varying bath heights were used to collect vibration signals. The Fast Fourier Transform was applied to the dataset before it has been analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). PCA was used to unveil the structure in the experimental data. PLS was mainly applied to predict the stirring from the vibration response. It was found that for each flow rate range considered in this study, the informative signals reside in different frequency ranges. The first latent variables in these frequency ranges explain more than 95 pct of the variation in the stirring process for the entire single layer and the double layer data collected from the cold model. PLS analysis in these identified frequency ranges demonstrated that the latent variables of the response and predictor variables are highly correlated. The predicted variable has shown linear relationship with the stirring energy and bath recirculation speed. This outcome can improve the predictability of the mixing status in ladle metallurgy and make the online control of the process easier. Industrial testing of this input will follow...|$|E

Under Senate Bill 1, Article VII of the 751 Texas Legislature the State of Texas will develop a Water Availability Modeling (WAM) system to support water rights, regulatory functions and water management in this state. The goal is assurance of a supply of water in the future. In order to determine the reliability of water resources, {{it is important to be}} able to assess current water supply and to use this data to project water supply in the future. This process includes the ability to estimate the amount of water at a location where there is not a record of flow. This research focused on the transfer of naturalized <b>flow</b> from <b>gaged</b> to ungaged locations for incorporation into the WAM system. The following general approaches for estimating naturalized flows at ungaged sites are addressed in various degrees of detail in this report: * distribution of flows in proportion to drainage area * flow distribution equation with ratios for various watershed parameters * adaptation of the NRCS CN method * use of stream gage records to develop regression equations relating flows to watershed characteristics * use of recorded data at gaging stations to develop precipitation-runoff relationships. These approaches were tested and some conclusions were drawn on the different methods of transferring <b>flow</b> from <b>gaged</b> to ungaged locations. The conclusion reached is that it is difficult to reproduce flow for any specific month, but that long term averages are reproduced with a greater degree of accuracy than monthly values. The alternative flow distribution methods provide about the same level of accuracy, and for this reason the decision of method used should be based on the judgment of the people studying the watershed.

40|$|As part of {{an effort}} to {{characterize}} the response of the Vermillion River to surface runoff, the flow records from seven gaging stations were analyzed to determine the data quality, typical low flows, and the contribution of major tributaries to the total flow. The flow record from the U. S. Geological Survey gaging station at Empire appears to give the most reliable flow data and has the longest record (33 years). An effort by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) to recalibrate other Vermillion River <b>flow</b> <b>gaging</b> stations appears to have resulted in self-consistent data for 2007 flows in the main stem and at tributary stations. Although many of the stream gaging stations examined in this study have flow records of up to eight years, flow data prior to 2007 have to be used with caution. To select a representative summer low flow for a stream temperature analysis, the 33 year record at the USGS station at Empire was analyzed to determine 7 Q 2, and 7 Q 10 low flows, and monthly median and mean flows. The monthly and 7 Q 2 flows are representative of typical flow conditions, while the 7 Q 10 flow is an extreme low flow condition.

40|$|Stream {{temperature}} and stream flow are important physical parameters for aquatic habitat preservation in river and stream systems. Water temperature {{is particularly important}} for coldwater stream systems that support trout. Summer base flow conditions with low flows and high water temperatures can be critical for maintaining trout habitat. Surface runoff from rainfall events can lead to increases in stream temperature, particularly in developed watersheds. To better understand the interactions between stream temperature, land use, and climate, an unsteady stream flow and temperature model has been developed for the Vermillion River. The model includes the main stem from Dodd Avenue to Goodwin Avenue {{and a number of}} tributaries, including South Branch, South Creek, North Creek, and Middle Creek. The EPDriv 1 package was used to simulate stream flow, including distributed groundwater inputs. Simplified stream channel geometry was required to obtain converged flow solutions for unsteady low flows. A stream temperature model has been assembled based on previous work at SAFL. The stream temperature model uses flow and flow area from the flow solver, along with observed climate data to calculate surface heat transfer. Groundwater inflows are an important component of both the flow and temperature model. For the Vermillion River, groundwater inflow rates were estimated from <b>flow</b> <b>gaging</b> sites, while groundwater temperatures were estimated by calibrating the stream temperature model. The calibrated combination of groundwater flow and temperature results in a good match of simulated and observed stream temperature, with RMSEs in the range of 0. 75 to 2 ºC.

In the present study, average monthly water flow measurements for 15 stream <b>flow</b> <b>gaging</b> stations within basins of these rivers in Iraq with population growth rate data in some of its part were used to evaluate the reality of the current situation and future challenges of water availability and demand in Iraq. The results showed that Iraq receives annually 70. 92 km 3 of water 45. 4 and 25. 52 km 3 from River Tigris and Euphrates respectively. An amount of 18. 04 km 3 of the Tigris water comes from Turkey while 27. 36 km 3 is supplied by its tributaries inside Iraq. The whole amount of water in the Euphrates Rivers comes outside the Iraqi borders. Annual decrease of the water inflow is 0. 1335 km 3 year- 1 for Tigris and 0. 245 km 3 year- 1 for Euphrates. This implies the annual percentage reduction of inflow rates for the two rivers is 0. 294 % and 0. 960 % respectively. Iraq consumes annually 88. 89 % (63. 05 km 3) of incoming water from the two rivers, where about 60. 43 and 39. 57 % are from Rivers Tigris and Euphrates respectively. Water demand increases annually by 1. 002 km 3; of which 0. 5271 km 3 and 0. 475 km 3 within Tigris and Euphrates basins respectively.

40|$|Pine Creek has {{historically}} provided critical spawning and rearing habitat for Eagle Lake rainbow trout (ELRT, Oncorhynchus mykiss aquilarum). Over the past 100 + years modifications of Pine Creek watershed (e. g., overgrazing, timber harvest, passage barriers, culverts) decoupled the ELRT from its stream habitat. Introduced brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) now dominate historic rearing {{areas in the}} upper watershed. Passage barriers were constructed on Eagle Lake tributaries to prevent ELRT from spawning in degraded habitat, denying the ELRT access beyond the first kilometer of stream. Since 1950 the lake fishery has been maintained by artificial spawning. Offspring are reared in hatcheries and released into Eagle Lake. Since 1987 changes in grazing management, reconstruction of culverts, and other conservation projects have resulted in marked improvement of habitat, although ELRT have been not allowed to attempt their natural spawning migration. Their ability to migrate has been questioned, and concerns led to a petition for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act. We report on a long term study to track the spring migration of ELRT spawners in Pine Creek. We tracked the upstream migration of ELRT spawners {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek. We then related ELRT spawner migration to stream flow and snowpack, and related flows to snowpack and air temperature. It is possible to predict ELRT migration distance from flow, duration of flow, or from snowpack. The relationships between migration distance and flow, and migration distance and snowpack in the upper watershed were weak. However, sample sizes were small, due to the limited number of years in which fish have been tracked, and the cessation of operation of the <b>flow</b> <b>gages.</b> The positive relationships between migration distance and seasonal average daily mean streamflow, and between streamflow and snowpack are particularly interesting in light of climate predictions for California. By {{the end of this century}} snowpack is likely to be reduced 65 - 97 % in the elevation range of Pine Creek. The creek is likely to flow more during the winter, due to winter rain events, and to have lower summer baseflows. It is possible that ELRT spawners might shift to a strategy of earlier migration, moving upstream to areas of perennial summer flow during winter rain events. However, the fish currently lack the opportunity to experience and adapt to flow changes that are likely to occur with climate change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Long-term {{variations}} {{in the structure of}} mean monthly hydro-meteorological time series from the German part of the Elbe River Basin are analyzed. Statistically significant correlations between the 2 - 15 yr. scale av-eraged wavelet spectra of the mean monthly climate variables and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - and Arctic Oscillation (AO) - Index are found, which provides evidence that such long-term patterns in climate time series are externally forced. Application of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) re-sults in major low-frequency modes for the basin precipitation of the Striegis, Ohre and the Elbe River that coincide with those detected in the discharge time series. The percentage of the variance explained by the annual cycle and low frequency components is clearly larger for the discharge than for precipi-tation. This manifests itself also through higher DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) Hurst parameter (H) estimates for discharge than for precipitation. Upon subtraction of the annual- and the major low frequency SSA- signal from the raw time series data, the DFA H parameter estimates suggest a short-range memory structure of the residuals for both precipitation and dis-charge. For the Este-River <b>flows</b> at <b>gage</b> Emmen we show additionally that the low frequency variability modes can be predicted by the SSA recurrent algorithm...|$|R
40|$|After {{the flood}} of December 1964, 12 gaging {{sections}} in northern California widened as much as 100 % and aggraded as much as 4 m, and then degraded to stable levels {{during a period of}} 5 years or more. As channels aggraded, bed material became finer, and low to moderate <b>flow</b> through <b>gaging</b> sections in pools became shallower, faster, and steeper. Comparisons of longitudinal profiles also show the diminishment of pools as well as a decrease in bar relief accompanying the excessive sediment load. As gaging sections degraded, hydraulic geometries recovered to a limited degree; full recovery probably depends on channel narrowing and further depletion of sediment supply. The hydraulic changes with aggradation indicate an increase in the effectiveness of moderate discharges (less than 1 - to 2 -year recurrence interval, annual flood series) to transport bed load and shape the bed. Bars become smaller, pools preferentially fill, and riffles armored with relatively small gravel tend to erode headward during falling stages and form a gentler gradient. Excess sediment can thus be more readily transported out of channels when additional contributions from watersheds are usuall slight. A stream channel at grade provides the impetus to transport the supplied sediment load while maintaining a stable bed elevation [Mackin, 1948, p. 471]. Stream channels tha...|$|R

40|$|The Water Availability Modeling (WAM) System {{developed}} and {{maintained by the}} Texas Commission on Environmental Quality includes the generalized Water Rights Analysis Package (WRAP) simulation model and WRAP input datasets {{for all of the}} river basins of Texas. This report documents an investigation that consisted of developing, testing, and applying procedures for (1) extending WAM hydrology datasets to cover a longer period-of-analysis and (2) condensing WAM water right datasets to focus on a particular water management system while reflecting the effects of all other water rights in the stream flow inflows. The WRAP computer programs HYD and SIM were expanded to provide the necessary computational capabilities. The procedures were applied to the WRAP input dataset for the Brazos River Basin from the Texas WAM System (Brazos WAM). The modeling methods developed are applicable to other river basins as well. The Brazos WAM has a 1940 - 1997 hydrologic period-of-analysis. The research included developing and applying methods to extend the period-of-analysis to 1900 - 2007 providing a better representation of river basin hydrology. The 1998 - 2007 extension included adjusting observed <b>flows</b> at <b>gaging</b> stations to develop sequences of monthly naturalized flows and then distributing the naturalized flows to ungaged sites. A new methodology was developed for converting <b>gaged</b> <b>flows</b> to naturalized flows utilizing water management/use information available in the WAM System supplemented with additional observed data. Available <b>gaged</b> stream <b>flows</b> compiled in a previous study were adopted without naturalization adjustments to extend the hydrologic period-of-analysis to cover the period 1900 - 1939. Monthly flows for 1900 - 1939 were synthesized for ungaged sites. The impacts on simulation results of lengthening the hydrologic period-of-analysis from 1940 - 1997 to 1940 - 2007 and 1900 - 2007 were evaluated. The Brazos WAM has 3, 830 control points, 670 reservoirs, and hundreds of water rights. The research included developing and applying methods to create a much easier-to-apply condensed dataset with only 48 control points and 14 reservoirs that is focused on a reservoir system operated by the Brazos River Authority and associated water rights. The effects of all of the numerous other reservoirs and water rights in the river basin are incorporated in the stream flow inflows at the 48 selected control points while properly maintaining the priority system reflected in the water right permits. A comparison of simulation results obtained with the condensed versus full WAM datasets confirms that the methodology does properly preserve the effects of the numerous water rights, reservoirs, and control points removed from the WAM dataset in creating the condensed dataset. Modeling applications and issues are explored...|$|R
40|$|As part {{of their}} long range goals for {{disseminating}} information on measurement techniques, instrumentation, and experimentation {{in the field of}} hydraulics, the Technical Committee on Hydraulic Measurements and Experimentation formed the Task Committee on Experimental Uncertainty and Measurement Errors in Hydraulic Engineering in January 2003. The overall mission of this Task Committee is to provide information and guidance on the current practices used for describing and quantifying measurement errors and experimental uncertainty in hydraulic engineering and experimental hydraulics. The final goal of the Task Committee on Experimental Uncertainty and Measurement Errors in Hydraulic Engineering is to produce a report on the subject that will cover: (1) sources of error in hydraulic measurements, (2) types of experimental uncertainty, (3) procedures for quantifying error and uncertainty, and (4) special practical applications that range from uncertainty analysis for planning an experiment to estimating uncertainty in <b>flow</b> monitoring at <b>gaging</b> sites and hydraulic structures.

40|$|We applied {{quantile}} regression to streamflow {{data from}} gages in relatively unimpaired river basins and indices for three major modes of climate {{variability in the}} Western US for 1912 - 2010. Our objectives were to determine where changes occurred in the distributions of streamflow and climate indices, and to associate the changes in streamflow and climate. Quantile regression results revealed significant changes {{during the period of}} record in mean annual streamflow and the index for and annual transition in standardized sea level pressure at Darwin, Australia. Streamflow changed significantly (p ? 0. 05) at 57 % of the gages. Upper quantiles of <b>flow</b> increased at <b>gages</b> in states along the West Coast and in the Great Basin, while lower quantiles of <b>flow</b> decreased at <b>gages</b> in states of the Colorado Plateau. During the same time period, the index for and annual transition in Darwin SLP (DSLP and t-DSLP, respectively) also changed significantly. In 77 % of the cases where high flows increased, the flows correlated most frequently with DSLP and t-DSLP for June-August. In the remaining 23 % of the cases, the quantiles of flow were not correlated with any of the climate indices used in this study. In all cases where the low flows decreased, the lower quantiles of flow correlated with DSLP for June-August as well as for June-October and DecemberFebruary, all of which changed significantly since 1912. The results show that significant changes in Western US streamflow, and DSLP and t-DSLP, the ENSO variables, occurred mainly in the upper and lower quantiles of the distributions between 1912 and 2010. Gages which exhibited increases in high flows were geographically distinct from those where low flows decreased. Eighty-two percent of quantiles of flow which changed significantly during the period of record were correlated with DSLP and/ or t-DSLP. The influence of changes in ENSO on streamflow, however, must be interpreted within the context of modulating effects of AMO, PDO, and time which were also correlated with flows that changed. While climate explains much of the variance in streamflow, factors in addition to the climate indices used in this study also contributed to changes in streamflow regime in the Western US since 1912...|$|R
40|$|Sardinian Regional Authorities, such as Assessorato della Difesa dell’Ambiente, {{have the}} {{demanding}} problem of water management and protection. Targeted to their specific needs they use alternative applications and models for their specific tasks. Black box models, in the past, {{have been the}} most commonly used approach to describe the hydrological cycle. Despite their wide use, these models have shown severe limitations to take into account land use and climate changes. Physically based models can make better prediction when different combination of soil and land use, within the basin, {{have a significant effect on}} the hydrological cycle. The variety and complexity of alternative environmental problems found in the island, which vary from the impact of the agro-zootechnical to the industrial compartment, have suggested that empirical models are less suitable to predict the environmental dynamics at the catchment’s scale. Regional Authorities enact Regional Directives to enforce different European Directives, and no absolute limits can be drawn to separate their alternative field of application. The Piano di Tutela delle Acque Regional Directives aim to enforce water policy in terms of definition on where and how water resources must be used and what water protection actions need to be taken to improve water quality of rivers, lagoons, groundwater, lakes etc [...] In this context, the hydrological physically based SWAT model has been chosen and applied to estimate both the water balance of the main catchments of the island and the impact of land management practices on downstream water bodies. The performance of the model has been evaluated on several stream <b>flow</b> monitoring <b>gages</b> against registered data. The study has been partially funded by the Sardinian Regional Authorities. 369 - 37...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid {{computer}} program is developed {{to simulate the}} outflow hydrographs of two urban watersheds located within Salt Lake County, Utah. The gaged outflow of the watersheds provided a checkpoint for comparing the observed and the simulated final outflow hydrographs. The outflow hydrographs for each subzone of the two watersheds were obtained by abstracting interception, infiltration and depression storage from each subzone hyetograph. The outflow of the subzones were routed to the Jordan River, the final outflow point of the two watersheds. The final hydrographs of the watersheds were combined and compared with the <b>gaged</b> <b>flow.</b> The uniquenesses of this systems model are the flexibility in varying hyetographs, variable loss rates, combination of subzone hydrographs, and the combination of watershed hydrographs. Subzone hydrographs can also be plotted for visual inspection as well as obtaining numerical values. With a variety of input and output data, designers and planners can visually perceive urban runoff characteristics. The systems model should be a tool used by those interested in urban runoff characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Instream flows were {{developed}} for two New Hampshire rivers. This talk {{focuses on the}} frequency of times when the instream flow and duration are not met (failure), {{the severity of the}} water deficit, the characteristics of the failure probability distributions, regionalization of the results, and potential management approaches to attain instream flows. The two rivers in this study are the Lamprey and Souhegan Rivers. Instream flows {{were developed}} for various bioperiods through the year. The instream flows are both flow and duration specific for each bioperiod. Natural long term hydrology was developed from today’s <b>gaged</b> <b>flows</b> by removing human disturbances from the records. By comparing the instream flows to the long period flow records, the probability distributions of flows were fitted to the failure characteristics (frequency of occurrence, duration, deficit volume). These probability distributions can then be used to predict extreme events much as is done for flood predictions. In addition, the characteristics of these distributions can be put into a fashion that allows them to be applied regionally. That is, with estimates of watershed size and average streamflow, the effects (failure characteristics) of applying similar instream flows to other streams can be estimated...|$|R
