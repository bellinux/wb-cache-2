5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented <b>economic</b> <b>strength,</b> {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such <b>economic</b> <b>strength</b> led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{economy was}} among the most {{advanced}} in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine <b>economic</b> <b>strength</b> until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until {{the first half of the}} 6th century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and resilient.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and <b>economic</b> <b>strength.</b> Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the revolt of 1381 was {{the conduct of the}} war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, {{beginning}} a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater <b>economic</b> <b>strength</b> to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.|$|E
5|$|Historically the {{commercial}} capital of Canada, it was surpassed in population and <b>economic</b> <b>strength</b> by Toronto in the 1970s. It remains an important centre of commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, education, culture, tourism, gaming, film and world affairs. Being {{the location of}} the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Montreal is one of three North American cities home to organizations of the United Nations (along with Washington, D.C. and New York) and also has the 2nd-highest number of consulates in the continent. Montreal was also named a UNESCO City of Design. In 2009 Montreal was named North America's leading host city for international association events, according to the 2009 preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA). The 2017 edition of QS Best Student Cities ranked Montreal as the best city in the world to be a university student. According to the 2015 Global Liveability Ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Montreal ranked 14th out of 140 cities.|$|E
5|$|In 1354, when Dejan had {{finished}} building the Arhiljevica Church of the Holy Mother of God, his endowment, he asked {{that some of}} the villages under his administration be granted to the church (as metochion). According to Stefan Dušan's charter to Arhiljevica dated 10 August 1354, sevastokrator Dejan, whom he called his brother ("брат царства ми севастократор Дејан"), possessed a large province east of Skopska Crna Gora. It included the old župe (counties) of Žegligovo and Preševo (modern Kumanovo region with Sredorek, Kozjačija and the larger part of Pčinja). The granted villages included: village Podlešane with hamlets, village Arhiljevica at the church with hamlets, village Izvor, village Ruginci (Ruǵince), selište (arable land) Mokra Poljana (Mokro Polje), village Maistorije, selište Maistorije Krupnici, selište Prusci (Rusce), selište Vrdun, selište Prvevo, selište Deikovo (Dejlovce), selište Vrače (Vračevce), selište Sedlar, selište Mekša and village Glaže (Glažnja). A total of 9 villages, 9 selište and a few hamlets. Based on the charter, Arhiljevica was situated where the granted villages of Podlešane, Izvor and Rućinci lay, on the slopes of Jezer (Kumanovska Crna Gora). The fact that Dejan built Arhiljevica rather than renovated it is evidence of his <b>economic</b> <b>strength.</b> Apart from Dejan's granted villages, Dušan also granted, on his behalf as a gift, the church and village of Gospoždino Polje (lost), village Koznica Kričanovska (Gorna- and Dolna Koznitsa) and village Strojkovo (lost), situated in the Velbužd region.|$|E

His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary <b>economic</b> <b>strengths</b> of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|R
