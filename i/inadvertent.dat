5|$|At Devarakota, Harsha kills Ratnam and Sashi at {{the factory}} and construes it as an {{accident}} due to an <b>inadvertent</b> short-circuit, similar to what Sashi had done before Ravikanth's arrest years before. The film ends with Ravikanth and his family visiting Rao's house on Sankranthi, where Harsha, now Charuseela's husband, receives them warmly.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the <b>inadvertent</b> reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|E
5|$|On the April 13 {{episode of}} Raw, The Miz lost {{a match to}} Kofi Kingston due to Morrison's <b>inadvertent</b> interference, which gave Raw a draft pick in the 2009 WWE draft. The pick was then {{revealed}} to be The Miz, and retaliated by subsequently attacking Morrison, ending their partnership and thus turning John Morrison face.|$|E
5|$|Suit {{inflation}} gas may {{be carried}} in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may {{also need to be}} colour coded to avoid <b>inadvertent</b> use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm {{is stored}} in the spermathecae, organs of the female {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and <b>inadvertent</b> introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the <b>inadvertent</b> effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} intracellular inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against <b>inadvertent</b> release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or <b>inadvertent</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|While Skanderbeg {{had been}} away, a large Ottoman assault {{was made on}} Krujë from the Tirana side, but <b>inadvertent</b> {{friendly}} fire from the Turks forced them to call off the assault. The Ottomans then attempted to mine the fortress, but could not succeed, since the fortress had been built on rock. Since the food supplies were beginning to run out, the Turks received provisions from Venice, as did the Albanians. The Turkish attacks had made no headway and the Ottoman army had lost many dead or wounded, whereas Skanderbeg's force had lost 1,000 men thus far. Moisi Golemi and Tanush Thopia raised a couple thousand more and the force was split between the three, making attacks on the Turkish camp easier. Skanderbeg began to move towards the camp as the Turks had assembled 8,000 men which began to move towards him. Skanderbeg slowly retired, while Moisi and Tanush broke into the camp. The Turkish force sent against Skanderbeg was lured towards the foothills {{and the next morning}} (July 25) they were surrounded and completely destroyed. The next day, Skanderbeg was seen above the rocks of Krujë, in conference with Vrana Konti, surprising Murad.|$|E
5|$|Despite Harry's {{aunt and}} uncle's desperate {{prevention}} of Harry gleaning about his powers, their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, {{who is also}} his first contact with the Wizarding World. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts {{as well as some}} of Harry's history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. As its <b>inadvertent</b> saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him like he is their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or <b>inadvertent</b> exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was not the result of an Arkansas turnover. This was the only game in the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. There was a very confusing ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. But there was also an <b>inadvertent</b> whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E

When Bernardo was unable to continue, Aerts was disqualified.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with this analysis. Surviving officers from the Japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone: their radio operators had been left in Japan to send fake traffic, and all radio transmitters aboard the ships (even those in the airplanes) were physically disabled to prevent any <b>inadvertent</b> or unauthorized broadcast.|$|E
