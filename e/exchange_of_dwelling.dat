50|$|Home exchange, {{also known}} as house swapping, {{is a type of}} {{hospitality}} service in which two parties agree to offer each other homestays (lodging in each other's homes) for a set period of time. Since no monetary exchange takes place, it is a form of barter, collaborative consumption, and sharing. Home exchange can cover any type <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> including apartments, houses, holiday cottages, boats, or recreational vehicles. It can include an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> the entire home or just a room. The length of the swap can vary from a weekend to a year or more. The swap can be simultaneous or non simultaneous.|$|R

The Index <b>of</b> Prices <b>of</b> <b>Dwellings</b> is constructed {{using data from}} the Catalog of Real Estate Prices, a system through which information about purchases <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> is gathered by the Capital Gains Tax Bureaus throughout the country. These data on transactions include new dwellings and dwellings whose ownership changed. The sample consists of 67 urban localities which have: 1) 20, 000 or more residents, 2) 5, 000 or more dwellings, according to the inventory <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> in Israel as listed in the Municipal Taxation List, and 3) a reasonable number of transactions relative to the number <b>of</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The index excludes dwellings built by individuals, transactions performed through a group of buyers, transactions from public companies, and dwellings with no market value. The Index <b>of</b> Prices <b>of</b> <b>Dwellings</b> is calculated using a hedonic regression that considers the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>dwellings</b> and adjusts for differences in their quality.
