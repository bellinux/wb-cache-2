500|$|Qualification for the 2008 European Championship {{proved too}} much, England losing the final {{qualifier}} against Croatia 3–2 in November 2007, when a draw {{would have been}} enough to take England to the finals. The British press turned on McClaren, former Scottish international Alan Hansen stating that [...] "...what McClaren should be held accountable <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with a squad of this quality he failed to qualify from what seemed a reasonably straightforward group...". McClaren was sacked the day following the defeat to Croatia, and was replaced in December 2007 by Italian Fabio Capello.|$|E

I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I can hope <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} effect {{that needs to}} be compensated <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> at some cut-off frequency the line response starts to roll-off like a simple low-pass filter. [...] The effective bandwidth of the line can be increased with a section that is a high-pass filter matching this roll-off, combined with an attenuator. [...] In the flat part of the pass-band only the attenuator part of the filter section is significant. [...] This is set at an attenuation equal {{to the level of the}} highest frequency of interest. [...] All frequencies up to this point will then be equalised flat to an attenuated level. [...] Above this point, the output of the filter will again start to roll-off.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: [...] "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." [...] May added that [...] "what I've asked <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} IRT subway lines (i.e. those {{built before}} the Dual Contracts) were built to modified elevated line dimensions. Whereas the IRT els were originally equipped with cars that were [...] long, the cars {{designed for the}} IRT subway measure [...] long. Both sets of lines did not permit cars wider than [...] The clearances and curves on these lines are too narrow and too sharp for any IND or BMT equipment. The later extensions of the IRT, constituting {{the bulk of the}} IRT system, were built to wider dimensions, and so are of a profile that could support the use of IND/BMT sized equipment. [...] In other words, B Division equipment could operate on much of A Division if station platforms were trimmed and trackside furniture moved, thus letting A Division service carry more passengers. However, there is virtually no chance of this happening because the older, narrower portions of A Division are centrally situated, such that {{it would be impossible to}} put together coherent through services. The most that can be reasonably hoped <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some branch lines of Division A might be resized and attached to B Division lines. This was done with the BMT Astoria Line in Queens (which had formerly been dual-operated with normal IRT trains and special narrow BMT shuttles), and has been proposed for a connection of the Second Avenue Subway to the IRT Pelham Line in the East Bronx.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Murray and Burton were {{confirmed}} as having declined {{to return to}} the series. For months, it was speculated {{that they would not be}} returning for the seventh season. Then, in February, The CW announced a series renewal without specifying which cast members had renewed their contracts. A video of Murray, seemingly unaware he was being filmed, saying the show was not bringing him back because they wanted to save money, and encouraging fans to rally behind him, intensified speculation. A video of Burton saying she would stay if she had creative control also surfaced, fueling speculation that The CW did not want to keep Burton on the show without Murray. To some fans, One Tree Hill without Murray and Burton sounded [...] "kind of like Seinfeld without Seinfeld... and Elaine". It elicited skepticism from fans who consider the heart of the show to be the dynamic between their characters, Lucas and Peyton. A TVGuide.com poll found that nearly half of respondents, however, were willing to take a [...] "wait and see" [...] approach to a revamped version of the series. In April, Schwann told a crowd in Paris that all of the actors had signed on for season 7, except for Murray and Burton. [...] "They're in negotiations right now and I know they've been offered great things, and hopefully they'll decide to come back", he said. [...] "If they don't, that's always a possibility... has made it through some of the riskier moves we've done." [...] In May, CW entertainment president Dawn Ostroff stated, [...] "We tried to get them to stay; we would have been thrilled if they wanted to." [...] She said that since Murray and Burton were moving on, Tree Hill now had to reinvent itself a bit– as it did in 2007, with the four-year flash-forward. [...] "A show going into its seventh year is very open to reinventing itself," [...] said Ostroff. [...] "And one thing I have to give Mark Schwahn a lot of credit <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has kept the show so fresh all these years." ...|$|E
