5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him change my life.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{subsequently}} nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Ernest King was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer, so {{he wrote}} a citation for Bulkeley {{on behalf of the}} Navy. Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley wrote a book about his exploits, entitled They Were Expendable. Parts were serialized in Reader's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a movie of the same name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley, John Wayne one based on Kelly, and Donna Reed in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{euphoria}} of the victory was short-lived, as rumors began to swirl that Ohno and Smith, both good friends of Davis's, intentionally threw the race so that Davis would win. After returning to Colorado Springs, O'Hare would file a formal complaint. For three days, Ohno, Smith and Davis stood before an arbitration panel as {{three of their}} fellow skaters testified that they heard Ohno telling Smith that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Davis win.|$|E
25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity {{as an excuse for}} closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that happen. They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E

500|$|And so {{the issue}} was brought up at the {{acceptance}} of the spacecraft, a long drawn-out discussion. [...] I got a little annoyed, and I said, [...] "Look, there's no way there's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there's a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard. [...] We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them smoke." [...] Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, [...] "Go clean up the spacecraft.

500|$|Jay-Z was {{initially}} skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] {{was too big}} for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, {{on the same day}} of the audition, with Jay-Z saying [...] "There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her leave without signing a record deal.|$|E
500|$|One of Sherman's main {{concerns}} in postwar commands {{was to protect}} the construction and operation of the railroads from attack by hostile Indians. Sherman's views on Indian matters were often strongly expressed. He regarded the railroads [...] "as {{the most important element}} now in progress to facilitate the military interests of our Frontier". Hence, in 1867, he wrote to Grant that [...] "we are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a few thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress of [...]" [...] After the 1866 Fetterman Massacre, Sherman wrote Grant that [...] "we must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children." ...|$|E

500|$|Judge Roth ordered Taylor {{to choose}} a method of execution. Taylor chose to be {{executed}} by firing squad to make the process more difficult for Utah state officials.

[...] Regarding the option of lethal injection, Taylor said, [...] "I don't want to go flipping around like a fish out of water on that table." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} Troy {{and his father}} {{was sort of like}} a preview to the immense change that was to befall the town. With such a small community, strangers were {{uncommon}} and the arrival of the pair was a strange one. Mr Rutherford's occupation was also like a premonition to future events. As a man who bought and sold antique items which the people called 'old junk', his presence was foreshadowing the fact that the people were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of their past to make way for change and development.|$|R
500|$|A bright blues [...] "stomper" [...] about lovers parting, [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine" [...] {{is one of}} {{the more}} literal songs Dylan {{recorded}} in his 1965–66 period. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her [...] "pass". As in [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] and [...] "Absolutely Sweet Marie", he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line, which in this case comes from the title. [...] "Most Likely You Go Your Way" [...] was issued as a single a year later, in March 1967, on the B-side of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat".|$|E
500|$|Donayre {{became the}} center of an {{international}} controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which the general said [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Chileans pass by (...) [...] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a [...] party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan García, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.|$|E
500|$|Barker was {{released}} from a local emergency room after three hours of treatment and observation for a concussion and an eye that had swollen shut. The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand. He [...] attended his school's class ring ceremony and dance that evening. He later testified, [...] "I waited 11years to go to it. I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that get in my way." [...] He left the dance early due to pain. During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He {{said that he had}} suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.|$|E

Or you could ask some one of the {{passengers}} who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> London <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you go with him, and you could tell him that you had plenty of money to pay the expenses." ...|$|R
500|$|In the {{run up to}} World Group {{play-off}} against Croatia, Tim Henman {{had announced}} he would retire after this match. Murray said [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the team down or let Tim down, I'd feel terrible if I {{was the one that}} was responsible for losing Tim's last tie. This {{means a lot to me}} and it's definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the biggest Davis Cup match of my career." [...] "Everyone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want to win for Tim. I'm hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me." [...] Great Britain beat Croatia 4–1 to qualify for the World Group in 2008.|$|R

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{actress and}} singer Kristin Chenoweth was {{originally}} {{cast as the}} voice of Rapunzel while the film was still titled Rapunzel Unbraided under Keane's direction. Chenoweth, who had already begun recording dialogue for the role, said of her character at the time, [...] "I am Rapunzel, but Rapunzel is a squirrel ... and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> down my tail." [...] At one point, Disney had cast actress Reese Witherspoon as Rapunzel. Additionally, Witherspoon was also intended to serve as an executive producer on the film, but eventually exited the project for unknown reasons but has been suggested as creative differences. Following Witherspoon's resignation, Rapunzel remained uncast for quite some time, further jeopardizing the film's already troubled production, a period during which the character's voice was temporarily provided by [...] "friends around the studio" [...] in lieu of legitimate actresses.|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
