5|$|Foreign <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> also {{a factor}} in the state's {{population}} growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census.|$|E

25|$|During 1933-1948, the British {{government}} limited Jewish {{immigration to}} Palestine with quotas, {{and following the}} rise of Nazism to power in Germany, illegal immigration to Palestine commenced. The illegal <b>immigration</b> <b>was</b> known as Aliyah Bet ("secondary immigration"), or Ha'apalah, and was organized by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, {{as well as by}} the Irgun. <b>Immigration</b> <b>was</b> done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. Beginning in 1939 Jewish <b>immigration</b> <b>was</b> further restricted, limiting it to 75,000 individuals for a period of five years after which <b>immigration</b> <b>was</b> to end completely. During World War II and the years that followed until independence, Aliyah Bet became the main form of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.|$|R
