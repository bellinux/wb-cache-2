5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet <b>in</b> <b>length,</b> on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel <b>in</b> <b>length.</b> This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet <b>in</b> <b>length</b> and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912.|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} of each touring show was traditionally split into two acts of an hour each separated by a 30-minute interval; however, as of 2014, due to cost cutting issues, the shows have now {{been reduced to a}} shorter 55-minute first act followed by a 50-minute second act, still including a 30-minute interval. Permanent shows are usually 90 minutes <b>in</b> <b>length</b> without any intermission. This excludes Joyà (the permanent show in Riviera Maya, Mexico), which is only 70 minutes <b>in</b> <b>length.</b> Typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week.

The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Measurements for {{the first}} two known {{examples}} are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118 mm (4.9 and 4.6 <b>in),</b> tail <b>length</b> 115 and 110 mm (4.5 and 4.3 <b>in),</b> hindfoot <b>length</b> 27 and 28 mm (1.1 and 1.1 <b>in),</b> ear <b>length</b> 13 and 15 mm (0.51 and 0.59 <b>in),</b> skull <b>length</b> 29.8 and 29.0 mm (1.17 and 1.14 in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0 g (1.62 oz) and had testes 11 mm (0.43 in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen.

40|$|Zootoca vivipara is the {{smallest}} of four species of lizard occurring in the Czech Republic. For many species of lizards sexual dimorphism was found in different characters and their presence was predicted also in this species. Eight characters were measured: total body length, snout { [...] } vent length, tail length, head length, head width, number of ventral scales, number of femoral pores and number of lamellae under the fourth finger of hind leg. Analyzed specimens from collections of Prague National Museum came from two areas { [...] } Šumava and Děčínský Sněžník. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the Šumava area showed sexual dimorphism: males were larger <b>in</b> total body <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> tail <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> head <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> head width and had higher number of femoral pores than females. Females had higher number of ventral scales than males. Analysis of covariance for the Děčínský Sněžník area showed sexual dimorphism <b>in</b> total body <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> tail <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> head <b>length</b> and <b>in</b> head width. All these characters were higher in males. Females had higher number of ventral scales. Variability of some characters showed dependence on altitude. Significant dependence on altitude investigated by analysis of covariance was detected in specimens from the Šumava area <b>in</b> total body <b>length,</b> <b>in</b> tail <b>length</b> and head length: the values of all these characters decreased with increasing altitude. Head width exhibited significant dependence on altitude only in absolute values (ANOVA) : the values decreased with increasing altitude. Specimens from the Děčínský Sněžník area exhibited significant dependence on altitude only in absolute values of body length, of head length and of head width. Analysis of covariance was not significant...|$|R
