5|$|Martinengo {{had been}} ill {{for some time}} before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a <b>fragile</b> <b>state.</b> The choir had been {{neglected}} and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the capella), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 {{at the age of}} 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional a cappella repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on aid {{has come a}} long way in recent years, and as a result we now know much more about aid effectiveness than possibly ever before. But significant gaps in knowledge remain. One such gap is the effectiveness of aid in the so-called ?<b>fragile</b> <b>states?,</b> countries with critically low policy and institutional performance ratings. The current paper addresses this void by examining possible links between aid and economic growth in <b>fragile</b> <b>states.</b> It finds that: (i) growth would have been 1. 4 percentage points lower in highly <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> in the absence of aid to them, compared to 2. 5 percentage points in other countries; (ii) highly <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> from a per capita income growth perspective can only efficiently absorb approximately one-third of the amounts of aid that other countries can, and; (iii) while from the same perspective most <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> are under-aided, to the extent that they could efficiently absorb greater amounts of aid than they currently receive, many of the highly <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> are substantially over-aided in this sense.

In recent times, the state of India-Italy bilateral relations have mirrored the political fortunes of Sonia Maino-Gandhi, the Italian born leader of the Indian National Congress and who was the de facto leader of the UPA government of Manmohan Singh. The relationship continues to be polluted by investigations for impropriety in defence deals involving Italy and legal wrangling on matters of court jurisdiction and sovereign immunity after the killing of two Indian fishermen by Italian Navy Marines. Italian actions to politicise the issue has entrenched India's resolve to refuse a political settlement and pursue the case of the Italian marines to a judicial conclusion. Italy has reportedly resorted to opposing India within the European Union and at multilateral forums: from dampening India's efforts in Brussels to going slow on India's bid to join the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The <b>fragile</b> <b>state</b> of the Italian economy (severely shaken by the European sovereign-debt crisis when PIGS economies needed Bailout support) has significantly eroded Italy's influence in the Mediterranean Basin.

25|$|The Liberal-Democratic Party {{remained}} an important force in Russian politics. At {{the height of}} its fortunes, the LDPR gathered 23% {{of the vote in}} the 1993 Duma elections and achieved a broad representation throughout the country – the LDPR being the top vote-getter in 64 out of 87 regions. This fact encouraged Zhirinovsky to once again vie for the presidential office, this time against incumbent Boris Yeltsin. The fact that Yeltsin's candidacy seemed seriously challenged by Russian nationalist groups and a rejuvenated Communist Party alarmed many outside observers, particularly in the Western world, who expressed concern that such developments posed a serious threat to the survival of Russian democracy, already in a very <b>fragile</b> <b>state.</b> Zhirinovsky became a focal point of harsh criticism and seemed the living embodiment of authoritarianism and militarism in modern Russia. While some observers inclined to consider his controversial statements as stark efforts to drum up nationalist support, not viewable as anything more serious than electoral fodder meant for domestic consumption, there was great consternation at the fact that in February 1996, months before a presidential election, Zhirinovsky placed second in opinion polls, behind Communist Gennady Zyuganov and ahead of Boris Yeltsin. In the end, however, Zhirinovsky placed fifth with a 5.7% share {{in the first round of}} voting. Since then, the party's fortunes have stabilized somewhat, with the 2003 election seeing a LDPR vote share of 11.7%. In 2004, Zhirinovsky declined to even be nominated by the party, leaving that role to Oleg Malyshkin, who received 2% support from voters.|$|E

40|$|Executive summary: <b>Fragile</b> <b>states</b> are an {{increasing}} priority for international diplomatic and development attention. The media – defined here as {{both traditional and}} digital media – is being transformed in most <b>fragile</b> <b>states.</b> Such transformations are unleashing unprecedented democratic energy, with profound political and social consequences. <b>Fragile</b> <b>states</b> are often fractured states, divided along religious, political, ethnic or other factional fault lines. For all the fresh potential they offer citizens to hold government to account, new media landscapes are also increasingly fractured – and are often fragmenting along the same fault lines that divide society. Co-option of the media by narrow factional interests appears to be growing. Successful political settlements in fractured <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> depend on societies developing a stronger sense of shared identity. In the past, critics of support to media in <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> have argued that a free and diverse media can foster division, reinforce factional identities and undermine state stability. The prospects of more open, free and vibrant media environments have prompted wariness in the past among those working to support state stability where government and governance is sometimes weak. This briefing examines how current media trends are affecting state and societal fragility, both positively and negatively. It argues that development actors should embrace the reality and opportunities provided by changed media and communication environments and {{that the role of}} a free and plural media should be prioritised rather than – as seems the case at present – marginalised in much <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> policy. It argues that shared identity and sustainable political settlements will be best enabled by national and local dialogue. Such dialogue is dependent on a free media that is independent of undue factional or governmental control. Efforts to shut down the media, even if feasible, risk doing more harm than good in <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> as elsewhere. Support to the media in <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> designed to minimise the risk of division and maximise the opportunities for dialogue should feature more prominently in assistance to such states. The briefing is designed principally for policy- makers working to support development in <b>fragile</b> <b>states.</b> It draws on and summarises some of the conclusions drawn from earlier policy briefings published by BBC Media Action {{on the role of the}} media and communication in four <b>fragile</b> <b>states</b> – Afghanistan, Iraq, Kenya and Somalia. The central section (pages 14 – 28) provides a summary of each of these briefings.
