5|$|The first Games {{held under}} the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought {{together}} 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events. Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games. George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games. The <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.|$|E
5|$|The move {{took some}} {{pressure}} off <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> bonds, which {{had just been}} downgraded to junk status, {{making it difficult for}} the government to raise money on capital markets.|$|E

5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until such time as the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E

5|$|Venizelos {{determined}} {{that the cost of}} completing Salamis would be too high, since it would preclude the acquisition of destroyers or a powerful naval air arm. Instead, the two old pre-dreadnoughts Kilkis and Lemnos would be retained for coastal defense against Yavuz. This decision was reinforced by the onset of the Great Depression that year, which weakened Greece's already limited finances. On 23 April 1932 the arbitrators {{determined that}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> owed AG Vulcan £30,000, and that AG Vulcan would be awarded the hull. The ship was broken up for scrap in Bremen that year. The second Greek dreadnought, Vasilefs Konstantinos, met a similar fate. Like Salamis, work on the ship was halted by the outbreak of the war in August 1914, and in the aftermath the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> refused to pay for the unfinished ship as well.|$|E

50|$|According to Victor Roudometof, the {{incident}} led to {{significant change in}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>government's</b> stance toward Slavic-speaking citizens. Henceforth, they were deemed to be neither Serbs nor Bulgarians, and their difference was regarded as solely linguistic, not ethnic or political.|$|R
5|$|A new {{front was}} opened in Salonika {{at the request}} of the <b>Greek</b> <b>government,</b> {{intending}} to support Serbian forces and oppose Bulgaria. The first troops of the British Salonika Army, arrived in Salonika in October 1916, too late to prevent the Serbian Army from retreating into Albania and Greece. French, British and Russian troops arrived in Salonika between 1916 and 1917 and became known as the Allied Army of the Orient or Allied Army of the East, under the overall command of French General Maurice Sarrail.|$|E
5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> {{ignoring}} Zappas's {{instructions to}} refurbish the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Greek</b> <b>government’s</b> {{decision}} to close ERT has been criticised in various activist channels as anti-democratic or even irrational.

50|$|An {{editorial}} {{published by}} Kathimerini claimed {{that after the}} removal of the right-wing military junta in 1974, <b>Greek</b> <b>governments</b> wanted to bring left-leaning Greeks into the economic mainstream and so ran large deficits to finance military expenditures, public sector jobs, pensions and other social benefits.|$|R
50|$|Several {{successive}} <b>Greek</b> <b>governments</b> had in {{the past}} attempted to improve the situation. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work.|$|R
5|$|In Switzerland, Constantine I and {{his family}} found {{themselves}} isolated and without an income. The <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed. The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and {{she was forced to}} live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past. She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, Vice-admiral du Fournet, {{commander-in-chief}} of {{the allied}} Mediterrean fleet, used the sinking of two Greek merchant ships by a German submarine, {{as well as the}} secret agreement, to demand the surrender of the docked Greek war ships and took command of the Salamis naval arsenal. The <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> yielded, and on 7 November, the partial disarmament of Greek warships began. The Allies towed away 30 lighter craft. Three weeks later the French took over the Salamis naval base completely, and began using Greek ships operated by French crews.|$|E
5|$|On June 1 the Great Powers (including Italy and Austria-Hungary) {{approved}} {{the results of}} the negotiations and on June 23 the terms of the Protocol were officially approved by the Albanian Government. The <b>Greek</b> <b>government,</b> without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos advised Georgios Christakis-Zografos to approve the protocol’s terms without asking for even wider autonomy.|$|E
50|$|Jonas King (born in Hawley, Massachusetts, 29 July 1792; died in Athens, Greece, 22 May 1869) was a Congregational clergyman {{from the}} United States {{who worked as}} a missionary, mainly in Greece.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis has triggered {{a process of}} political convergence between Italy and Greece. The simultaneous downfall of the Italian and <b>Greek</b> <b>governments,</b> following the public withdrawal of European conﬁdence {{in their ability to}} handle the crisis, was followed by the establishment of technocrat-led governments based on parliamentary ‘super-majorities’ and then by ‘protest elections’, marked by unprecedented levels of electoral volatility...|$|R
50|$|An {{agreement}} concluded {{between the}} British and <b>Greek</b> <b>governments</b> in Athens on 22 August (Gregorian style)/4 September 1920, {{in order to}} regulate legal relations between Greek citizens and the court system in Egypt.

5|$|The Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a Regency Council, {{headed by}} Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, who, in Bavaria as {{minister}} of finance, had recently succeeded in restoring Bavarian credit, {{at the cost}} of his popularity. Von Armansperg was the President of the Privy Council, and the first representative (or Prime Minister) of the new <b>Greek</b> <b>government.</b> The other members of the Regency Council were Karl von Abel and Georg Ludwig von Maurer, with whom von Armansperg often clashed. After the King reached his majority in 1835, von Armansperg was made Arch-Secretary, but was called Arch-Chancellor by the Greek press.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} Albania again became {{the cause of}} {{international}} conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever {{the results of the}} investigation, Mussolini insisted that the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.|$|E
5|$|With the {{delineation}} of {{the exact}} boundaries of the new state, the region of Northern Epirus was awarded to Albania {{under the terms of}} the Protocol of Florence, signed on 17 December 1913. On 21 February 1914, the ambassadors of the Great Powers delivered a note to the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> asking for the Greek army's evacuation of the area. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos acceded to this in hopes of a favorable solution to Greece's other outstanding problem: the recognition of Greek sovereignty over the islands of the North Eastern Aegean.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold <b>Greek</b> <b>government</b> bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
