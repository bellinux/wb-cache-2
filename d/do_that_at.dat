25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>At</b> the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
500|$|Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's {{shortest}} album when recorded, {{running for}} approximately 45 minutes. The {{focus of the}} album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: [...] "You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, you can never <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the cost of it having relevance to what you’re singing." [...] Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that [...] "their ethos is to be pushing {{the limits of their}} songwriting ability".|$|E
500|$|Much as {{the label}} had argued {{with the band}} over {{the quality of the}} songs before production, RCA {{continued}} to debate the issue with Priestess after the album sessions were finished in the fall of 2008. Despite the confidence the band themselves had in the strength of the album's material, RCA still did not share that sentiment and refused to release the album, as they felt it still lacked a potential single. Reflecting on the situation, Heppner remarked, [...] "You can't force write a single, it's impossible to <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>At</b> least it's impossible for us. We're not Tin Pan Alley songwriters; we're a rock band." ...|$|E

6000|$|Isabel {{had listened}} eagerly; {{her face was}} full of pain and wonder. [...] "My aunt <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> fixed periods and lets nothing turn her aside. When the date comes round she starts; I think she'd have started if Ralph had been dying." ...|$|R
500|$|In December 2013, Wright, {{a fan of}} {{the comic}} book since childhood—owning copies of Tales to Astonish #27 {{featuring}} [...] "The Man in the Ant-Hill" [...] storyline and Marvel Premiere #47 featuring the first appearance of Scott Lang— stated that the difference between Ant-Man and other films featuring size-changing is [...] "other shrinking movies are usually about somebody trapped small. This is different in that he can actually change size and he can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> will, so it becomes more of a power than an impediment." [...] Wright also talked about the challenge of directing a superhero film, saying, [...] "Shaun and Hot Fuzz and World's End are all R-rated films. I like the challenge of making a PG-13 film. Because you've got to entertain in a different way. You don't have the same tools." [...] By December 19, Rudd was in negotiations to star in the film, and Marvel announced that he had been cast as Ant-Man the next day.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2005 the Chicago Cubs signed Williamson to a minor league {{contract}} and added him to their 40-man roster, but he almost immediately went on the 60-day disabled list: in the end Williamson had undergone the second Tommy John surgery and was not yet recovered. Williamson returned to the team in August but struggled with his velocity. Sportswriters wondered at the wisdom of coming back in less than 12 months {{without the benefit of}} spring training. Williamson himself said that he was [...] "trying to find my rhythm and it's hard to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the big-league level." [...] Williamson eventually appeared in 17 games; his ERA, 8.68 in the beginning of September, dropped to 5.65 {{by the end of the}} season. Showing its confidence in Williamson, Chicago exercised its option to bring him back for another season.|$|E

50|$|Tom Seaver {{struck out}} ten {{consecutive}} batters in 1970, but no pitcher has <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of}} a game. Joe Cowley of the 1986 Chicago White Sox has come the closest to Welch's record, striking out the first seven batters of a game.|$|R
60|$|Ian {{replied to}} both remarks by saying that, whether black or blue, they {{must make the}} best of it, and set about <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> once. To <b>do</b> his desponding comrades justice, they were quite ready for {{vigorous}} action in any form, notwithstanding their despair.|$|R

50|$|Ding Junhui {{fell out}} of the top 16 prior to the tournament, and had to qualify to the Crucible {{for the first time since}} 2007. He <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the loss of just seven frames, beating Greg Casey 10-4, Ross Muir 10-1, and the 1995 runner-up Nigel Bond 10-2.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> not see <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all," [...] said Crosbie. They {{were both}} {{leaning on the}} rails, and so they {{remained}} for the next twenty minutes. [...] "I <b>do</b> not see <b>that</b> <b>at</b> all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no,' she said, 'not {{painting}} them--only sketching the outlines. I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{night to}} save time--I {{have to get}} three dozen done {{by the end of}} the month.' ...|$|E

He also defended his links with Christie, stating that he would not have remained with Christie if he thought he had cheated.|$|R
6000|$|I must really. Fff. Now if I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> a banquet. Just a {{question}} of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear.

O, the whore of the lane! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Especially the {{hospital}} scene, {{where you find}} the wounded son. Why, mother, {{do you know when}} we <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> last rehearsal my face was wet with real tears as you cried over me. It will bring down the house; but don't forget to wipe 'em off, or I shall sneeze,' said Demi, laughing at the recollection of his mother's hit.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{will not}} <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present," [...] said the Queen. [...] "When I shall have {{thoroughly}} examined and studied all these objects, {{most of which}} are entirely new to me, we will decide about the button-holes." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Very candidly, I {{think we}} made a mistake. Because we thought about adding Missouri and Kansas at the time. There was {{not a great deal}} of enthusiasm about that. I think we should have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the time. So we would have had Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and then moved into that other area. I think, by the way, that that can still happen." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We're {{constantly}} {{trying to}} find anybody making inroads, and they <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> radio and online, only after the fact did we learn about the school, but it's such a cool story it piqued our interest further. They {{did it in a}} unique way. It's a real example of a band putting themselves on our radar rather than waiting for us to find them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as you're always <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> any rate," [...] remarked Jack, [...] "we could {{scarcely}} {{call it a}} change.

6000|$|Mr. M'Ruen {{twisted his}} head and laughed. He delighted in playing with his game as a {{fisherman}} does with a salmon. 'Well--no--I haven't put in the amount yet. Do you sign it, and I'll <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's a worse trick still, sir; for it tempts {{the poor}} thoughtless boys {{to go and}} marry the first girl they can get hold of; and it don't want much persuasion to make them <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> any time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You cannot <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> this moment. There is {{a gentleman}} with him. I am {{waiting for the}} gentleman. His {{business}} with Mr Fledgeby will very soon be transacted, {{and then you can}} go up. Until the gentleman comes down, you must wait here.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Another one of Price's {{distinguishing}} traits on {{the court}} was his pioneering of the splitting of the double team. As former teammate Steve Kerr explains, [...] "Mark really revolutionized the way that people attack the screen and roll. To me, {{he was the first}} guy in the NBA who really split the screen and roll. A lot of teams started blitzing the pick and roll and jumping two guys at it to take the ball {{out of the hands of}} the point guard. He’d duck right between them and shoot that little runner in the lane. Nobody was <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time. You watch an NBA game now and almost everybody <b>does</b> <b>that.</b> Mark was a pioneer in that regard." ...|$|R
