5|$|The {{story begins}} with a quiet, {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because {{he said that he}} heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be <b>judgmental.</b> He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several <b>judgmental</b> mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a <b>judgmental</b> church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be <b>judgmental.</b> If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E

25|$|Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) (1973–77), host of WJM's The Happy Homemaker show.

25|$|The term {{analgesic}} nephropathy usually refers to damage induced by {{excessive use of}} combinations of these medications, specifically combinations that include phenacetin. For this reason, it is also called analgesic abuse nephropathy. Murray prefers the less <b>judgmental</b> analgesic-associated nephropathy. Both terms are abbreviated to the acronym AAN, by which the condition is also commonly known.|$|E
25|$|Sexual arousal {{disorders}} {{were previously}} known as frigidity in women and impotence in men, though these {{have now been}} replaced with less <b>judgmental</b> terms. Impotence {{is now known as}} erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{critics were}} excited at the {{prospect}} of finding a major missing link in Shostakovich's creative output, yet refrained from value-laden comparisons. They generally placed the Fourth Symphony firmly in its chronological context and explored its significance as a way-station {{on the road to the}} more conventional Fifth Symphony. Western critics were more overtly <b>judgmental,</b> especially since the Fourth was premiered back-to-back with the Twelfth Symphony in Edinburgh. The critical success of the Fourth juxtaposed with the critical disdain for the Twelfth led to speculation that Shostakovich's creative powers were on the wane.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{turns to}} the topic of love, which, he says, is in the realm of women. Women {{naturally}} have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire of women is against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient Sparta, where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed woman is the one who is most social, most talked about, <b>judgmental</b> and authoritative.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be <b>judgmental</b> or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa {{started out}} {{socially}} awkward, she quickly became popular with her classmates. In the manga, she once {{became president of}} her class. Her initial shyness {{could be attributed to}} {{the fact that she was}} teased in the 30th-century for not having any Soldier powers. As the manga progresses, she gradually matures, becoming more comfortable with herself and more confident with her Soldier abilities. Because her dream in the manga is to become a beautiful lady, her actions often are based around this. She tries to be a perfectionist and starts off trying to do everything alone and for herself. This view evolves as she realizes what maturity really is and what it really means to be an adult. In the original anime, she is more <b>judgmental</b> and does not mature as much as her manga counterpart. But she does in Sailor Moon Crystal and gets along better with Usagi.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{explained}} that his depiction of suburbia is [...] "not a bad place. It's a weird place. I {{tried to walk}} the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being <b>judgmental.</b> It's a place where there's a lot of integrity." [...] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered {{as a teenager in}} suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a [...] "high school fantasy".|$|E
500|$|After only making {{sporadic}} appearances {{for several}} years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air {{appearances in the}} WWE, this time under the gimmick of an , <b>judgmental,</b> bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for [...] "what's best for business," [...] all the while romanticizing {{each other in the}} process with public displays of affection.

Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of C4 to the high note of F5. A ballad, [...] "Does Anybody Hear Her" [...] is an alternative CCM and adult contemporary song. Lyrically, the song relates {{the story of a}} young woman who is being pushed away by the Christian church. It delivers the message that condemning other people is wrong and that the Christian church is being too <b>judgmental</b> of pregnant teenagers.|$|E
500|$|Burton biographer Ken Hanke {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of Dolores Fuller. [...] "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," [...] Hanke said, [...] "while Parker's performance presents her {{as a kind of}} sitcom moron for {{the first part of the}} film and a rather <b>judgmental</b> and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes." [...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story, because we really loved each other. We strove to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Coup" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Paul Lieberstein, who plays series regular Toby Flenderson, and was directed by executive producer and series creator Greg Daniels. Several cast members believed the episode contains Shakespearean themes, in particular elements of the Macbeth character Lady Macbeth in Angela's storyline. Lady Macbeth was depicted as an ambitious woman who [...] "exerted an evil influence over her husband," [...] characteristics that fit with Angela attempting to push her lover, Dwight, into power. In her weekly blog for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery previewed the episode, [...] "Behind every great man is a pushy woman. Or in this case, a pushy, short, <b>judgmental</b> blonde named Angela. It's the ultimate Adam-and-Eve saga. Angela is about to push the apple in Dwight's face as she persuades {{him to try to}} take Michael's place at Dunder-Mifflin [...]" ...|$|E

[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] because she wanted to shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, <b>judgmental</b> place you can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E
500|$|James Charney {{notes in}} his review of the book for Library Journal, [...] "Questions of {{effectiveness}} or possible harm are hardly considered." [...] Charney characterizes {{the problem of the}} book and its subject matter as a [...] "kind of with-it diffuseness which disallows any intelligent understanding on principle". In a review of the book for The New York Times Book Review, Zane Berzins was critical of the work, commenting: [...] "There isn't much to be said for the book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination." [...] A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review characterizes it as, [...] "Not a book, really. A verbatim transcription of one of Werner Erhard's weekend sessions in $250 doublethink." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticizes the author for not engaging in any <b>judgmental</b> analysis of the est training methodology. The review concludes, [...] "at least the reader finally has an opportunity to see what an estian seminar is, with vomit bags, circuitous logic, pathetic interplay between overbearing trainer and angst-ridden trainee, and all." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2004, child {{pornography}} {{charges were dropped}} in exchange for Reubens' guilty plea to a lesser charge. For the next three years, he was required to register his address with the sheriff's office {{and he could not}} be in the company of minors without the permission of a parent or legal guardian. Reubens later stated that he was a collector of erotica, including films, muscle magazines and a sizable collection of mostly homosexual vintage erotica, such as photographic studies of teen nudes. Reubens said that what the city attorney's office viewed as pornography, he considered to be innocent art and that what they described as people underage engaged in masturbation or oral copulation was, in fact, a <b>judgmental</b> {{point of view of the}} nudes that Reubens described as people [...] "one hundred percent not" [...] performing sexual acts. Being an avid collector, Reubens had often purchased bulk lots, and one of his vintage magazine dealers declared that [...] "there's no way" [...] he could have known the content of each page in the publications he bought and that he recalled Reubens asking for [...] "physique magazines, vintage 1960s material, but not things featuring kids".|$|E
500|$|For Booklist, Ray Olson called What's So Amazing About Grace? a [...] "well-written and {{engaging}} book [...] {{will continue to}} nourish readers' hunger for spiritual sustenance long after it has answered the appetites of an initial burst of consumers". He compared the book to Max Lucado's The Great House of God, also published in 1997, writing that, although Yancey and Lucado have both written several bestselling Christian books, Yancey's book was edited better. Olson praised as pithy the author's summaries of [...] "Babette's Feast" [...] and Love in the Time of Cholera. In the Calgary Herald, David Briggs compares What's So Amazing About Grace? to Johann Christoph Arnold's Seventy Times Seven: The Power of Forgiveness, also published in 1997; according to both books, Christians should be more charitable to others and less <b>judgmental</b> of them. Henry Carrigan writes in his Publishers Weekly review that [...] "the book's anecdotal style is often frustrating, but Yancey's measured prose and his insights into the stories make the book worth reading". In her 1998 Winnipeg Free Press review, Karen Toole-Mitchell criticizes Yancey's contention that everyone needs grace and that Christians have a special ability to offer it. She calls Yancey's grace [...] "cheap... {{because it was not}} needed, it was not felt, and ultimately it was not received".|$|E
500|$|The song's title phrase {{originated}} from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going, and the brother responding, [...] "It's like running to stand still." [...] Bono {{had not heard}} the phrase before, and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction {{and the effects of}} the drug on the body were like; a writer later described the title as a [...] "perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction." [...] Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts, a man and a woman, who lived in the Ballymun towers. [...] Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit, the man became a heroin smuggler, operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday. Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions, as well as poor choices, and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives. [...] The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly, but instead [...] the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in. [...] In doing so, the song is not <b>judgmental</b> and shows sympathy for the woman. [...] A character monologue from Wim Wenders' 1984 film Paris, Texas, was also a significant influence on Bono's writing of the song.|$|E

Yitzhak Arad, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens [...] "erred in his fundamental conception– that the German administration regarded the existence of the ghetto and its inhabitants vital for economic reasons" [...] and that [...] "the policy laid down by Jacob Gens {{was the only one that}} afforded hope and some prospect of survival". Vadim Altskan, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that [...] "...Holocaust historiography treated people such as... Jacob Gens... as instruments of destruction in the hands of the Nazi killing machine.... Applied retrospectively, these charges for the most part are <b>judgmental</b> and add very little to our understanding of the events. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'ordinary' Jews had any practical or psychological experience in dealing with the grim reality of the Nazi occupation, because never before in their long history of persecution had the Jews experienced an assault of such magnitude and careful design." [...] Regarding the charge of collaborating with the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, [...] "to say that [...] 'cooperated' or 'collaborated' with the Germans is semantic confusion and historical misrepresentation". The Israeli Zionist poet Nathan Alterman investigated the history of the Vilnius Ghetto, including interviewing survivors such as Abba Kovner, and stated [...] "Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been on the side of the Judenrat." ...|$|E

He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being <b>judgmental</b> about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

A running gag, Bonnie constantly complains about Kim's tardiness for cheerleading practice due to her tasking job.

However, Kim is not a tomboy, and exhibits personality traits and interests typically associated with teenage girls, including shopping and fangirling over popular trends. Flawed, the character also has a tendency to come off as <b>judgmental,</b> jealous and overly competitive at times.
