5|$|Eventually, matter <b>itself</b> is {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on <b>itself</b> after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around <b>itself</b> (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat <b>itself</b> in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited.

The small village of Wood Green <b>itself</b> is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor <b>itself</b> was situated on the ancient arterial road of Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E

The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012. The disasociation formally ended on May 8, 2013. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.|$|E
