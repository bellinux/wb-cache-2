The two most common explanations for this are sample selection and crossproductivity effects.

In this study, we control for time-invariant heterogeneity that may be correlated with the spouse’s education level and use a rich data set that includes observations of individuals when they are single {{and when they are}} married.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper, {{starting}} from a theoretical framework, is to analyze the spillover effects of human capital brought by labor mobility and their influence on the public education investment. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the endogenous growth theory, the paper establishes a regional <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillover</b> model to examine the spillover effects of human capital coming along with the regional labor mobility and the changes of public education investment decision brought by the spillover effects in China. Findings – It {{has been found that}} the regional mobility of labor has made the developed areas gain the spillover benefits of human capital investment from the underdeveloped areas with their superiority of social and economic environment and restrained the incentives for public education investment in the underdeveloped areas, thus the different areas walk on a different growth path, with the expansion of the difference in the economic and education investment growth. Originality/value – This paper analyzes the possible influences from the spillover of human capital on the economic growth and educational investment and finds a high possibility for the underdeveloped areas to get into a “low development trap” of education investment. The key to solving the problem is to internalize the externalities by the active public policy, in order to realize equal education, rational investment and balanced development.

40|$|I {{assess the}} {{magnitude}} of human capital spillovers in US cities by estimating plant level production functions. I use a unique firm-worker matched dataset, obtained by combining the Census of Manufacturers with the Census of Population. After controlling for a plant’s own human capital, plant fixed effects, industry-specific and state-specific transitory shocks, I find that the output of plants located in cities that experience large increases in the share of college graduates rises more than the output of similar plants located in cities that experience small increases in the share of college graduates. Several specification tests indicate that the estimated effect is not completely spurious. First, within a city, the spillover between plants that are geographically and economically close is positive, while spillovers between plants that are geographically close but economically distant is zero. Second, most of the estimated spillover comes from hi-tech plants. For non hi-tech productions, the spillover is virtually zero. When I stratify the sample by the percentage of employees who are college educated, I find that the spillover is larger the larger the percentage of college educated workers in the plant. Third, density of physical capital in a city outside a plant {{has no effect on}} a plant’s productivity. Consistent with a model that includes both standard and general equilibrium forces and spillovers, the estimated productivity differences between cities with high and low levels of human capital match remarkably well differences in labor costs that are typically observed between cities with high and low levels of human capital. This is important because, in equilibrium, any productivity gain generated by <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillover</b> should be offset by increased costs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} economic growth and the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector for a panel of 503 Brazilian micro-regions for the period 1980 - 2004 using panel spatial econometrics. It investigates {{the importance of the}} SME sector size measured by the share of the SME employment in total employment, and the level of human capital in the SME sector measured by the average years of schooling in SMEs. The exploratory spatial data analysis show strong evidence accounting for the existence of spatial dependence and indicate the use of spatial econometrics techniques to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the importance of entrepreneurship for regional economic growth. The empirical results indicate that the relative importance of SMEs (size of SME sector) is negatively correlated with economic growth. On the other hand, human capital embodied in SMEs present a positive and significant impact on economic growth. Moreover, the interaction of the relative size of the SME sector across space is positive and statistically significant for growth, suggesting that more SMEs in neighbouring regions incites productive entrepreneurship and new economic possibilities that affect economic performance positively. This is in line with the idea that entrepreneurial activities have a more positive influence on neighbouring regions than on distant regions due to cultural aspects. Besides, the spatial lag of human capital in SMEs is negatively related with growth and indicates that a given region does not benefit from a higher level of human capital in the neighbouring region; SMEs in regions with higher level of human capital only attract more skilled labour from neighbouring regions and do not generate any spillover for those regions. Therefore, a SME policy that subsidizes the creation of SMEs does not generate economic growth directly but through spatial interactions. Additionally, the promotion of human capital in SMEs seems to be important for regional growth, although there is no <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillover</b> in the SME sector...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{social and}} private returns to higher education, which {{have important implications}} for development and public finance. Despite their importance, reliable empirical evidence on the returns to higher education is scarce due to the endogeneity in higher education at individual and aggregate levels. This dissertation exploits quasi-experiments to explore the causal effect of higher education on various outcomes. The first chapter, "Does <b>Human</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Spillover</b> Beyond Plant Boundaries?: Evidence from Korea" explores a social return to human capital by examining the magnitude of human capital externalities on plant productivity. Human capital externalities exist if plants in a region {{with a high level of}} human capital can produce more [...] given similar inputs [...] than plants in a region with less human capital. This is difficult to ascertain because human capital levels are endogenous. To address this issue, this paper exploits an educational reform which exogenously increased cross-region differences in the supply of college graduates starting in the mid 1980 s. Using annually collected plant level data, I explore the effect of changes in human capital levels induced by this reform on plant productivity. My results suggest that externalities are limited. I find a correlation between the level of human capital and plant productivity which is similar to that observed in the U. S. However, after using an instrumental variable, the effect of the overall level of human capital on productivity decreases and becomes statistically insignificant. The second chapter "The Impact of College Education on Labor Market and Non-pecuniary Outcomes"(with Hyelim Son) exploits an education reform in Korea which discretely increased freshmen enrollment in 1981 [...] to examine the private returns produced by college education. Due to the compulsory school entrance law in Korea, the cohorts that were born after 1962 were more likely to enter college in 1981 or after. Thus, the cohorts born after 1962, had a higher chance of having college education than the cohorts born before. We exploit this idea and adopt a regression discontinuity design to compare the fraction of individuals with some college education and the average wage for cohorts born close to 1962. Our result suggests that college education has a positive effect on labor market outcomes. In addition, we find that college education affects saving, smoking and transfer behavior. The third and final chapter of my dissertation, "The Effect of Higher Education on the Careers of Workers", examines the effect of college education on individuals' subsequent careers. As documented by recent literature, college graduation plays a direct role in revealing an individual's ability to labor market. Thus, the ability of college graduates is more directly observed than the ability of high school graduates in the labor market. I examine whether this difference in ability revelation between college and high school graduates has an implication on their career after hey enter the job market. I build a model that yields testable implications regarding the effect of college education on ability revealing activity, given the role of college education in ability revelation. Using the NLSY 79 data, I empirically confirm the prediction of the model. In particular, I find that high ability high school graduates more actively engage in ability revealing activities than high ability college graduates. Overall, the results coincide with the predictions of the model, implying that the difference in ability revelation has a large implication on understanding different careers of high school and college graduates...|$|E

An illustrative example is the policy of regional "growth-poles 2 ̆ 01 d, which assumes that a local concentration of a specific industry in a limited geographical area will lead to a growth take-off. The theoretical rationale for this type of regional policy can be knowledge spillovers, whose importance for the economic (employment) growth has been emphasised in the endogenous growth literature. Yet, there is a considerable debate about the precise nature of knowledge spillovers. Do the externalities accrue between sectors (Jacobs-externalities), or are they rather intra-sectoral (MAR-externalities) ? Apart from the question what local economic structure is conducive for employment growth, an equally important issue concerns the timing of the impact of externalities. Is it the current economic structure that matters for employment growth, or rather the historical economic structure? If the former turns out to be the case, regional policies might become effective immediately. In the latter case the impact of policy might be slower but also longer lasting. In this paper we study the dynamics of local employment growth in West Germany from 1980 to 2001. Using dynamic panel techniques, we analyse the nature and the timing of Jacobs- and Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities, as well as the impact of general <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillovers.</b> Jacobs-externalities are stronger in manufacturing than in services, the opposite is true for MAR-externalities.

Growth is driven by formal sector <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillovers.</b> Restrictive institutions impose barriers to formality that reduce the growth rate and increase inequality. Redistributive taxation lowers inequality but blunts the incentive to accumulate, lowering growth. Institutional structures vary more across than within countries. Consequently, variations in institutional barriers to formality {{may account for the}} negative relationship between growth and inequality found in the cross-country data. Variations in the intensity of redistribution may account for the positive relationship observed within countries over time. Growth, Inequality, Dualism, Informal Sector, Institutions...|$|R

I measure the elasticity of wages to {{changes in the}} supply of the various skill groups, using time series and cross sectional data on Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US in 1980 and 1990. Unlike previous studies, I estimate own and cross-wage elasticity for each skill group and I allow for the existence of <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> <b>spillovers</b> in the labor market. Moreover, I introduce a new instrument to control for the bias that occurs when local labor supplies are simultaneously determined with local wages. I find that cross-wage elasticities are significantly different from zero and therefore should not be ignored. I also find that the estimated cross-wage elasticities are not symmetrical across skill groups, and therefore should not be constrained to be symmetrical...|$|R
