They argued that the clothing came from the killer and said police had found the blood types of the victims on the clothing. [...] Hakamada supporters said the case was full of holes, arguing that the alleged murder weapon – a <b>fruit</b> <b>knife</b> with a [...] blade – could not have withstood the forty stabbings of the victims without sustaining significant damage, and that the pajamas used to justify the arrest had disappeared and been replaced with the bloody clothing.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Cheong, {{considers}} {{his wife}} to be [...] "completely unremarkable in any way". He explains that when he first met her, he was not even attracted to her and that suits him just fine. Mr. Cheong is content meandering through life; {{it seems as if}} his only goal is to live a conventional, unremarkable life. He chooses to marry his wife since he thinks she would prove to be a good, dutiful wife who would fit nicely into the kind of lifestyle he seeks. [...] After several years of relatively normal marriage, Mr. Cheong wakes up to find his wife disposing of all meat products in the house. He demands an explanation, and Yeong-hye replies vaguely that [...] "I had a dream." [...] Mr. Cheong attempts to rationalize his wife's life decision {{over the next few months}} and to deal with vegetarian meals at home, but eventually calls Yeong-hye's family and an intervention is scheduled. While around the dinner table, Yeong-hye's family attempts to convince her to eat meat; her father, who served in Vietnam and is known for his stern temperament, slaps her when she refuses. Her father then asks a reluctant Mr. Cheong and Yeong-hye's brother Yeong-ho to hold her arms while he force-feeds her a piece of pork. Yeong-hye breaks away, spits out the pork, grabs a <b>fruit</b> <b>knife,</b> and slits her wrist. The incredulous family rushes her to a hospital where she recovers and where Mr. Cheong admits to himself that she has become mentally unstable. As the section ends Yeong-hye manages to walk out of the hospital and when she is tracked down, she reveals a bird in her palm, which has a [...] "predator's bite" [...] in it, and she asks [...] "Have I done something wrong?" ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{legal case}} in the English Criminal Courts has held that a {{grapefruit}} knife is, in fact, a knife. It is illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to sell knives to persons under 18. Trading Standards officers of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead brought charges in East Berkshire Magistrates' Court against W J Daniel and Company Limited, one of whose employees had sold a grapefruit knife to a test purchaser {{under the age of}} 16 on 17 February 2009. The magistrates were persuaded that it was not, in fact, a knife but a [...] "gadget" [...] and duly dismissed the case. At an appeal in the High Court, Sir Anthony May found that this was wrong. Using the definition of [...] "knife" [...] in the Oxford English Dictionary ("A cutting instrument consisting of a blade with a sharpened longitudinal edge fixed in a handle either rigidly, as in a table knife, carving or sheath knife, or with a joint, as in a pocket or clasp knife. The blade is generally of steel, but sometimes of other material, as in the silver fish and <b>fruit</b> <b>knives,</b> the blunt edged paper knife of ivory, wood, etcetera, and the flint knives of early man.") which, he said, accorded with his own understanding, he ruled that a grapefruit knife was indeed a knife within the meaning of the Act and upheld the appeal. The case was remitted to the magistrates to continue the hearing.|$|R

There is a long-running debate among historians over the extent to which science was applied to industry during the Industrial Revolution (I).

5000|$|A {{finger bowl}} is {{a bowl of}} water used for rinsing one's fingers after the last course of a formal meal served à la russe. It is {{typically}} brought to {{the table at the}} time of the dessert course, arriving atop the dessert plate, with a linen doily between the plate and the bowl and with the dessert fork and spoon on the plate. If a separate fruit course is to follow dessert, the finger bowl should be brought in at that time, with the <b>fruit</b> fork and <b>knife.</b> Alternatively, a full array of dishes can be brought out at once, with the finger bowl atop the dessert plate with its fork and spoon, and the dessert plate atop the fruit plate, with doilies between each dish; in this type of service, the <b>fruit</b> fork and <b>knife</b> are brought out after the dessert plates and silver are cleared. [...] "Where there are plenty of servants, the finger bowl may not come in on the fruit plate but may be brought on its own serving plate, replacing the used fruit plate before the guests leave the table for coffee." [...] A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it.|$|R

As the terrorists broke into the apartment, Weinberg was confronted by the leader Luttif Afif in a nearby bedroom. The wrestling coach picked up a nearby <b>fruit</b> <b>knife</b> and was shot through his cheek after slashing at the leader, slicing his left breast pocket open but not penetrating the terrorist leader's body.|$|E

During the attack, the assailant chased and hacked passengers with a 30 cm long <b>fruit</b> <b>knife.</b> Before the train could stop at Jiangzicui Station, a group of passengers banded together to distance themselves using umbrellas while others tried to discourage the attacker by loudly taunting him.|$|E

There is an active provision trade with the neighbouring Badawin, and the Syrian Hajj supplies the citizens with apparel and articles of luxury—tobacco, dried <b>fruits,</b> sweetmeats, <b>knives,</b> and all that is included under the word “notions.” There are few store-keepers, and their dealings are petty, because articles of every kind are brought from Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople. As a general rule, labour is exceedingly expensive,[FN#17] and at the Visitation time a man will demand fifteen or twenty piastres from a stranger for such a trifling job as mending an umbrella.

50|$|Tibetan dinnerware - plates, {{bowls and}} teacups - is {{traditionally}} made from wood, sometimes clay is used and lacquered. According to the village's or the family's tradition this handicraft was passed on {{from generation to}} generation. Those who could afford it, purchased high-quality porcelain bowls from elsewhere. Nowadays other types of porcelain Chinese or elsewhere are used. Chopsticks were made by oneself or imported from the forested regions in the south. The nobility even used chopsticks made from ivory with silver ornaments. Spoons are indispensable for most dishes. Poor people and children simply wore them around their necks to have them with themselves all the time. To eat <b>fruits</b> sometimes a <b>knife</b> is used. Some foods are eaten by hand. These fingerfoods include bread and also tsampa where a special technique is used to reach the right consistency by kneading it in the bowl (which {{is not so easy}} using only one hand).|$|R

40|$|Iron sand mined from Mukaihama {{beach in}} the city of Akita was applied to make "Tamahagane" based on {{combined}} use of the "Tatara-buki" and "Oroshigane" process. The Tamahagane was applied to make a small knife based on hot forging process. Initially, the iron sand was washed in water and dressed magnetically to rise iron content of the sand. After that, the iron sand was smelted by means of the "Tatara-buki" process to produce Tamahagane with lower phosphorous and sulfur contents. The Tamahagane was obtained in a 10. 4 % yield which was lower than that of 26 % in usual process. The reason was considered to be due to high concentration of SiO_ 2 in the dressed iron sand. The Tamahagane showed a mixed structure of ferrite and pearlite. Finally, the Tamahagane was forged at about 1100 K to make a small knife which was about 3 mm in thickness and 80 mm in length.
