5|$|The {{majority}} of pulpal toothache falls {{into one of}} the following types; however, other rare causes (which do not always fit neatly into these categories) include <b>galvanic</b> pain and barodontalgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased {{resistance to corrosion}} through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to <b>galvanic</b> corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free <b>galvanic</b> cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified <b>galvanic</b> cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a <b>galvanic</b> cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to <b>galvanic</b> corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processesâ€“ physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by <b>galvanic</b> corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Feller {{left for}} combat, {{his father died}} of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she {{was a student at}} Rollins College. After the marriage, Feller {{returned}} to service as Gun Captain aboard the Alabama and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the Alabama crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Feller's first taste of direct combat was at Operation <b>Galvanic</b> in November 1943. The Alabama also served during Operation Flintlock while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he {{spent the rest of the}} war at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station as an instructor.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} <b>galvanic</b> cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> {{treatment}} {{are often used}} on the face (facial <b>galvanic</b> treatment) and on the body to treat cellulite (<b>galvanic</b> cellulite treatments).|$|E
25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> {{corrosion}} {{occurs when}} two different metals have physical or electrical contact {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a <b>galvanic</b> couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the <b>galvanic</b> series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. <b>Galvanic</b> corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E
25|$|Factors such as {{relative}} size of anode, {{types of}} metal, and operating conditions (temperature, humidity, salinity, etc.) affect <b>galvanic</b> corrosion. The surface area {{ratio of the}} anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials. <b>Galvanic</b> corrosion is often prevented {{by the use of}} sacrificial anodes.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{are ranked}} {{according}} to <b>galvanic</b> numbers as a qualitative measure of their nobility. These numbers qualify {{the resistance to}} corrosion of any metal when in contact with other metals. A larger difference in the <b>galvanic</b> number between two metals in {{contact with each other}} indicates a greater potential for corrosion.|$|E

25|$|Good quality flutes are {{designed}} to prevent or reduce <b>galvanic</b> corrosion between the tube and key mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Filler metal (electrode material) {{improperly}} {{chosen for}} the environmental conditions can make them corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of <b>galvanic</b> corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo <b>galvanic</b> corrosion when mechanically joined.|$|E
25|$|A <b>galvanic</b> cell whose {{electrodes}} are zinc {{and copper}} submerged in zinc sulfate and copper sulfate, respectively, {{is known as}} a Daniell cell.|$|E
25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> {{corrosion}} is an electrochemical {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals is the driving force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower <b>galvanic</b> number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|<b>Galvanic</b> {{corrosion}} is {{a primary}} concern with metal roof maintenance. Marine environments present an additional concern due to the higher concentration of salts {{in the air and}} water.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the corrosion of uranium dioxide in an aqueous environment is controlled by similar electrochemical processes to the <b>galvanic</b> corrosion of a metal surface.|$|E

25|$|Cathode: The {{electrode}} {{at which}} reduction (a gain of electrons) occurs. For fuel cells and other <b>galvanic</b> cells, the cathode is the positive terminal; for electrolytic cells (where electrolysis occurs), the cathode is the negative terminal.|$|E
25|$|Anode: The {{electrode}} {{at which}} oxidation (a loss of electrons) takes place. For fuel cells and other <b>galvanic</b> cells, the anode is the negative terminal; for electrolytic cells (where electrolysis occurs), the anode is the positive terminal.|$|E
25|$|Some metals {{are more}} {{intrinsically}} resistant to corrosion than others (for some examples, see <b>galvanic</b> series). There are various ways of protecting metals from corrosion (oxidation) including painting, hot dip galvanizing, and combinations of these.|$|E
