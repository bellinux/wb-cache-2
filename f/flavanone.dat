Three <b>flavanones</b> showed inhibitory behavior towards the activation of hTAS 2 R 39 by ECG: 4 '-fluoro- 6 -methoxyflavanone, 6, 3 '-dimethoxyflavanone, and 6 -methoxyflavanone (in order of decreasing potency). The 6 -methoxyflavanones also inhibited activation of hTAS 2 R 14 (another bitter receptor activated by ECG), though to a lesser extent. Dose-response curves of ECG at various concentrations of the full antagonist 4 '-fluoro- 6 -methoxyflavanone and wash-out experiments indicated reversible insurmountable antagonism.
