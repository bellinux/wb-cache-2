40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> {{segmentation}} of brain tissues and MR bias field correction using a digital brain atlas. We have extended the EM segmentation algorithm, including an explicit parametric model of the bias field. The algorithm interleaves classification with parameter estimation, ielding better results at ever iteration. The method can handle multi-channel data and slice-per-slice constant offsets, and is <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> due {{to the use of}} a digital brain atlas...|$|R

5000|$|Gear change: The {{gear change}} in MMT is noticeable, unlike in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> car. Under E gear, the car will {{automatically}} change the gear depending on speed and gradient information. It {{is recommended that}} the accelerator pedal should be momentarily lifted off during gear change. A constant throttle can also be maintained on the accelerator, and gear change can still occur, although the car will feel noticeably more jerky during gear change than in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic.</b>|$|R

30|$|Peripheral {{white blood}} cell count and {{detection}} of C 3 and anti-nuclear antibody spectrum at every time point were provided by Medical Laboratory of Zunyi Medical University affiliated hospital. The method of peripheral {{white blood cell}} count was flow type laser impedance triple method (<b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> blood cell analyzer assembly line, XE- 5000, Sysmex). Method of C 3 detection was immunoturbidimetry (<b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> special protein analyzer, IMMAGE 800, Beckman).

50|$|In 1915, the German Rifle Testing Commission at Spandau {{decided to}} develop a new weapon for trench warfare. The {{original}} intention had been to modify existing semi-automatic pistols, specifically the Luger and C96 Mauser. However, the mechanisms of these pistols were not suited to the stresses of <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> fire, let alone the dirt and debris of the typical battlefield along with light weight weapons being difficult to control in <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> fire. Based upon this, the Commission determined that a completely new kind of weapon was needed.|$|R

5000|$|L/1 and 2 gears {{in a full}} automatic: The MMT {{does not}} provide L/1 and 2 gears as in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic.</b> One action of the MMT system is that it detects the {{gradient}} of the slope that the car is situated in. On a down-sloping incline and if the brake pedal is depressed, it automatically selects a lower gear to produce engine brake, which has the equivalent effect of L and 2 gears in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic.</b> L and 2 can also be substituted with E1 and E2 (not available in Aygo) or M1 and M2 gears in a MMT car. To select E1 or E2, put the gear to E, and use + and - pedal flaps {{on the steering wheel}} to override the computer selection. E will change to E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6, depending on the gear selected. Downshift to E1 or E2 as appropriate to simulate L and 2 gears in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic.</b> To select M1 or M2, put the gear to M, and use M- gear to downshift the gear to M1 or M2.|$|R
