5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections {{of the people in}} the scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a {{different}} design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by Paul I {{to play down}} Potemkin's role in Russian history, his name <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> numerous items of common parlance. The phrase Potemkin village entered common usage in Russia and globally, despite its fictional origin. A century after Potemkin's death, the Battleship Potemkin was named in his honour. The ship became famous for its involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequent dramatization in The Battleship Potemkin, a Soviet movie by Sergey Eisenstein, which at one point was named the greatest film of all time. The name of the giant seaside staircase in Odessa, featured in the movie, eventually {{became known as the}} Potemkin Stairs.|$|E
50|$|Westlothiana {{was named}} after the eponymous county in Scotland. When first found by {{professional}} fossil hunter Stan Wood, this creature was nicknamed 'Lizzy the Lizard'. This eventually <b>found</b> <b>its</b> Latinised <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the species names as lizziae.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} one adventurous pig <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> alone <b>into</b> the Harrington garden. Harrington saw it {{get in and}} at the same moment he saw Mrs. Hayden running through her orchard. She was in his yard {{by the time he got}} out.|$|R
5000|$|Tubi 60 is most {{commonly}} {{served as a}} shot or a shooter. Upon its arrival to export markets, it <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> cocktails. Co-founder Hilal Tubi has been quoted to say that [...] "The benefits of serving Tubi are such that if you mix it with other alcohols you are lessening its positive effects and increasing the likelihood of having a hangover, {{which is one of}} the best reasons to drink Tubi as it was designed”. It can also be consumed as part of a cocktail, adding juices or other non-alcoholic mixers. Tubi and Tonic or Tubi and Soda has become quite popular, as well as TubiLibre’s - Tubi 60 mixed with Coca-Cola.|$|R
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked {{out of the window}} and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses {{of his work}} at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
50|$|The Federalist, No. 78 (which {{deals with}} {{judicial}} powers, includingthe power of judicial review) has <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> mostoften <b>into</b> written {{opinions of the}} justices.

The idea which Miserrimus Dexter had jestingly put into her head, in exhibiting her {{to us on}} the {{previous}} night, had been ripening slowly in that dull brain, and had <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> outward <b>into</b> words, about fifteen hours afterward, under the irritating influence of my presence! ...|$|R
5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared {{an appreciation of the}} situation. Berryman also attempted to find out as much as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E
5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

50|$|The rise of Swedish {{centralisation}} and absolutism <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> partially <b>into</b> Bremen-Verden's practise. Bremen-Verden wasn't streamlined {{as to its}} jurisdiction and {{its military}} system, but the latter strictly subjected to Stockholms generalty. Especially in jurisdiction, Bremen-Verden's Estates maintained their stake. But Bremen-Verden's tax-levying department, almost entirely manned with Swedes and using Swedish as administrative language, was directly subordinated to the finance ministry in Stockholm.|$|R
50|$|Hobbes {{instead is}} drawing on his {{memories}} of the events and on two other possible sources, both written by James Heath around 1663. These are A Brief Chronicle of all the Chief Actions and the expanded A Brief Chronicle of the Late Intestine Warr. It is possible they were simply used as prompts for Hobbes, already 80 {{years old when he}} wrote Behemoth. According to MacGillivray very little material from these sources <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> directly <b>into</b> the text.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the three}} tonnes of stolen gold has never been {{recovered}} and the other four robbers were never convicted. In 1996 {{about half of the}} gold, the portion which had been smelted, was thought to have <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the legitimate gold market, including the reserves of the true owners, Johnson Matthey. According to the BBC, some have claimed that anyone wearing gold jewellery bought in the UK after 1983 is probably wearing Brink's-Mat.|$|R

60|$|The {{attention}} of Father Eustace {{was much less}} forcibly arrested by the marvellous tale of the Sacristan's danger, and his escape, than by {{the mention of the}} volume which he had brought with him from the Tower of Glendearg.

60|$|When {{the little}} party had {{returned}} to the cavern, the captain and the two ladies had a long talk about the lake. They all agreed that the existence of this great reservoir of water was sufficient to account for the greenness and fertility of the little plateau outside.
