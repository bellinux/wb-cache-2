40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the scope of poultry production by rural women and common diseases associated it in selected Local Government Areas of Kwara State, Nigeria. Specifically, the study examined various parameters of poultry production, {{the time of the}} year that diseases were most observed, the rate of mortality associated with various diseases and level of vaccination of birds in those villages. One hundred and twenty (120) women involved in rural poultry production were randomly sampled from four (4) villages in Kwara State, Nigeria. Interview schedule was used to elicit information for the study. The data were analyzed and presented as frequency counts and percentages. It was discovered that rural poultry production was still at the subsistent level. The highest percentage of the women involved in rural poultry production had 1 - 10 bird(s) per species (59. 13, 71. 43 and 57. 14 % for chicken, <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> respectively). A larger percentage of chicken (76. 72 %) hatched between 1 - 10 bird(s) per laying period while ducks hatched more birds than chicken during each laying period (65 % hatched between 11 <b>and</b> 20 birds). <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> had almost an even spread of the number of birds hatched per laying period across the flock size ranges considered. The common diseases observed by the respondents include Newcastle disease, fowl pox, coccidiosis and infectious bursal disease. The time of the year that diseases were prevalent was between September and December. Newcastle disease was indicated as the disease that resulted in the highest in mortality rate. Majority of the respondents had never vaccinated their birds and very few have ever contacted veterinary services (5 - 10 %), except at Share (63. 33 %).

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} four Italian local poultry species (chicken, <b>duck,</b> turkey <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl)</b> using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. AFLP molecular markers, have been an important tool to enrich existing genetic maps in plants, bacteria and less widely in animal genomes. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and AFLP analysis was carried out according to the protocol described in Barcaccia et al. 1999. Three primer combinations have been used to analyse all the samples and allowed the identification of a particular DNA fingerprinting pattern for each species that permits a clear distinction among them. A cluster analysis of the neutral and biallelic AFLP markers was performed within each species and it was possible to distinguish the different breeds.

VA. ” (Cassandro, 2004). A total of 117 unrelated males reared in two nucleus units of CO. VA. project in 2003 were analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from 68 ducks (Anas platyrhyncos) belonging to the Mignon and the Germanata Veneta breeds, 28 turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) of two different breeds, Ermellinata and Comune Bronzato, and 21 Camosciata helmeted <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> (Numida meleagris). AFLP genotyping was carried out following the protocol described by Barcaccia et al. (1999), modified for the use of TaqI endonuclease as the “frequent cutter” enzyme. In conclusion, AFLP markers allowed the genetic characterization of the three species; heterozigosity and Gst index can be used to monitor genetic variability within and among breeds, thus providing an important tool in the conservation scheme. In duck, AFLP markers permitted the genetic differentiation within species through cluster analysis and also by means of factorial analysis.

Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected during all three seasons studied in Chikwawa and Thyolo. In Chikwawa, 13. 6 % of adult cattle and 11. 7 % of calves were infected, compared to 28. 9 % of adult cattle and 36. 7 % of calves in Thyolo. Dependent on season, between 7. 8 % and 37. 7 % (Chikwawa) and 16. 7 % and 39. 3 % (Thyolo) of cattle samples contained oocysts. In Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season, whereas in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season. Faecal samples from goats [n = 225], pigs [n = 92], sheep [n = 6]), rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, <b>ducks,</b> turkeys, doves <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> were also analysed. Up to 5. 6 % of goat samples contained oocysts in Chikwawa, compared to between 16. 7 % and 39. 3 % in Thyolo. Again, in Chikwawa, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the cool season and the lowest in the rainy season, whereas, in Thyolo, the highest percentage of infections occurred in the dry season and the lowest in the cool season. In pigs, more infections were detected in the dry season in Chikwawa, but infections in the cool season were similar (17. 7 %), whereas in Thyolo, infections occurred in all three seasons (17. 9 % in the rainy season, 25 % in the cool season and 60 % in the dry season). Often diarrhoeic, oocyst positive cattle faecal samples collected from Chikwawa and subjected to PCR-RFLP, four oocyst positive samples (two from heifers, one from a cow and one unknown) were amplified at an 18 S rRNA and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) loci. RFLP of the 18 S rRNA locus indicated that Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium bovis and / or Cryptosporidium ryanae DNA, or a mixture of them was present. Cryptosporidium parvum DNA was identified in one sample that amplified at the COWP locus, indicating the presence of the major zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in Malawi. </span...|$|R
40|$|There are {{millions}} of chickens in Africa, <b>and</b> there are <b>ducks,</b> geese <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> too. Perhaps as many as 80 % are owned by rural families in flock sizes of maybe only five or six birds. High input, high output poultry development projects, based on European models, have largely failed in the past. Why, then, interfere with {{what seems to be}} working satisfactorily? Poultry provide a readily available source of animal protein, in the form of meat and eggs, and yet the protein deficiency gap of Africa's citizens is still widening. To provide a forum for discussing ways of improving poultry productivity, and thereby family nutrition, CTA organized an International Seminar in Thessaloniki, Greece, in October 1990. Fifty delegates representing 21 African countries (anglophone and francophone), European scientific research establishments, national administrations and international funding organizations, met to exchange practical experience and to formulate the best strategy for achieving Africa's potential in this field. Reducing the mortality rate The main obstacle to progress is the high mortality rate due to diseases, particularly Newcastle Disease (up to 90 % in Zaire) and the first step must be to improve on-farm management to reduce these heavy losses. Conventional vaccination, requiring refrigeration, is difficult in rural areas so delegates agreed that not only should thermostable, combined vaccines in pellet form be developed but that traditional remedies for disease should also be studied. There is no point introducing new, more productive, more expensive breeds if the chances are that the birds are going to die. Schemes where several local cockerels are exchanged for one exotic bird have failed because the chances are very high that the exotic bird will die, leaving the farmer with no cockerel at all. With several local cockerels, at least one is likely to survive. Indigenous breeds also show high disease resistance and better adaptation to harsh conditions and climate than imported exotics. They have lower bodyweight and longer legs. This means they need less food and can go-further into the scrub searching for it. Their chicks are black or mottled and are therefore less easy prey for hawks than the white chicks of most imported birds. Also the broodiness of local chickens is greater and must be preserved, at least until African farmers can afford incubators. These important characteristics should not be lost in the desire for increased productivity. Delegates felt that the study of the ability of some birds to eat high fibre food was particularly important since this reduces competition with people, and with pigs, for available cereals. Unconventional feedstuffs In order to further reduce this competition, the participants at the Seminar agreed that a collection and compilation of feedstuffs and an assessment of their nutritive value should be undertaken. Sources of unconventional feeds of no use in human nutrition yet ideal for poultry, were reported by many delegates. For instance, in Uganda, the freshwater lakes provide a source for fishmeal as do the waste products of the fish smokehouses of Cote d'lvoire. Brewers' grains, a by-product of the beer industry, are an excellent food source as is palm oil sludge. Cottonseed cake, providing it is fed in the correct proportion and at the right time, can also be used. Ensuring that such information is widely available was seen as one of the major development tasks for the future. One of the problems identified at the Seminar was that African scientists found exchange of information with European countries easier than with their African neighbours. Yet it is between countries that experience similar conditions that dialogue is likely to prove most valuable. Interdisciplinary research Delegates agreed that the need for an African Network on Rural Poultry Development was clear, not to replace existing organizations but rather to assist links between African and European institutions. The Network should be responsible for the documentation of results and dissemination of information; for the coordination of training programmes for research and development personnel; for the development of research and development protocols; and for the identification of research and development priorities, funding sources and cooperation opportunities. Above all it was stressed that research programmes should be interdisciplinary, covering all aspects of poultry production, with particular emphasis on adaptive on-farm research methods, in order to promote rural food security, stability of the rural labour force and to provide much needed additional family income.

Estimates of the time for rapid follicular development using this technique were 5. 1 and 5. 6 days for pigeons <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> respectively. Another measure of follicular development based on the incor-poration of Sudan dyes into the yolk yielded an estimate of 6. 5 and 8. 3 days for pigeons <b>and</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> respectively. Using one and two-egg clutches, no differences due to clutch position were observed in either species. There was a significant difference (P=s. 01) between results obtained with the two techniques for measuring the period of rapid yolk deposition. The dichromate technique can give valuable data relative to yolk deposition, especially in species where it is impractical to daily catch and administer Sudan dyes. But the tendency to underestimate the period of follicular growth means that caution must be exercised in comparing results obtained with that technique and the more labor-intensive Sudan dye incorporation method. The time from the end of yolk deposition until oviposition is defined as the rest period. This interval was 1. 5 days for pigeons and 1. 7 days for <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> This is considerably longer than the rest period of Coturnix quail but similar to that found in turkeys and chickens...|$|R
