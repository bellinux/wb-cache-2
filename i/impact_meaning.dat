The research is aim to appraise the existing literatures and eventually set the research agenda. Past studies revealed that there are relationships between the four cognitions of psychological empowerment: meaning, self-determination, competence and impact cognitions with organizational commitment. Furthermore, the extant literature also encapsulates the relationships between psychological empowerment and the three dimensions of organizational commitment: affective, normative and continuance commitment. However, results from the existing literatures are shown to be inconsistent. The paper concludes with suggestions for educational leaders to focus on enhancing psychological empowerment of <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> and competence cognitions in order to increase academic staff commitment within an organization.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of highly {{interactive}} and intelligent product-systems it becomes increasingly more difficult for design researchers to understand and predict the <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> and value of their designs for society. As the meaning of these products is often created in interaction, design researchers learn about their designs, and the user acceptance or rejection, only after product launch. Valuable insights and inspiration for design researchers are not incorporated in the design process, but come as an afterthought. Probing is a useful technique to inform and inspire design researchers, allowing them to gain early insights in their designs. The nature of most probing techniques is to record, analyze and understand current ‘static’ situations (i. e. ethnography), and to obtain information or inspiration for design researchers. Recent technological developments offer opportunities to probe in ‘dynamic’ i. e. changing or emerging, situations, and to merge analysis with design synthesis. This conceptual paper discusses different probing techniques through their fundamental characteristics: informing, inspiring, observational, experiential, static, dynamic etc. We further argue that 1) it is logic that probes with different characteristics fit different phases of the design process 2) dynamic, inspiring, Experiential Probes are more desired when initiating innovation for societal transformation...|$|E
40|$|We present {{observations}} and a dynamical {{analysis of the}} comet-like main-belt object, (596) Scheila. V-band photometry obtained on UT 2010 December 12 indicates that Scheila’s dust cloud has a scattering cross-section ∼ 1. 4 times larger {{than that of the}} nucleus, corresponding to a dust mass of Md ∼ 3 × 107 kg. V −R color measurements indicate that both the nucleus and dust are redder than the Sun, with no significant color differences between the dust cloud’s northern and southern plumes. We also undertake an ultimately unsuccessful search for CN emission, where we find CN and H 2 O production rates of QCN 100 Myr, suggesting that it is likely native to its current location. We also find that it does not belong to a dynamical asteroid family of any significance. We consider sublimation-driven scenarios that could produce the appearance of multiple plumes of dust emission, but reject them as being physically implausible. Instead, we concur with previous studies that the unusual morphology of Scheila’s dust cloud is most simply explained by a single oblique <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> this object is likely not a main-belt comet, but is instead the second disrupted asteroid after P/ 2010 A 2 (LINEAR) to be discovered.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Depressed {{patients}} {{suffer from}} autobiographical memory deficits. Indeed, depressed patients present an overgeneralization and a mood congruence biases. Moreover, {{they seem to}} have difficulties to recall positive memories. Our aim is to focus on a specific kind of memories called “self-defining memories” (SDM) which are highly pertinent for self-building. Their characteristics (e. g. specificity, meaning making) were assessed and compared to those of healthy subjects. HYPOTHESES. Depressed patients relate less specific and meaning making events than control group. A mood congruence bias is observed. METHOD. 17 depressed patients and 18 healthy subjects fulfilled SDM exercises: subjects were asked to relate six important events that happened in their life. These SDM were assessed on several variables: specificity, <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> making, contain. Moreover, subjects were assessed on depression severity and self-esteem (explicit and implicit). RESULTS. No difference between depressed patients and healthy subjects has been found for specificity. A marginal effect appeared for meaning making: control group seemed to relate more meaning making events than depressed patients. Depressed patients related more negative events than control group: this negative emotional valence was positively correlated with higher depression severity. Depressed subjects presented a lower explicit self-esteem than healthy subjects but no difference has been found for implicit self-esteem. Higher explicit self-esteem was positively correlated with positive emotional valence of SDM. DISCUSSION. Results partially support our hypotheses. Experimental and clinical implications of our results will be discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{worldwide}} trend towards stricter control of diesel exhaust emissions, however presently, there are technical impediments {{to the use}} of FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) -type biodiesel fuel (BDF). Although hydrogenated biodiesel (HBD) is anticipated as a new diesel fuel, the environmental performance of HBD and its utilization system have not been adequately clarified. Especially when waste cooking oil is used as feedstock, not only biofuel production but also the treatment of waste cooking oil is an important function for society. A life cycle assessment (LCA), including uncertainty analysis, was conducted to determine the environmental benefits (global warming, fossil fuel consumption, urban air pollution, and acidification) of HBD produced from waste cooking oil via catalytic cracking and hydrogenation, compared with fossil-derived diesel fuel or FAME-type BDF. Combined functional unit including "treatment of waste cooking oil" and "running diesel vehicle for household waste collection" was established in the context of Kyoto city, Japan. The calculation utilized characterization, damage, and integration factors identified by LIME 2, which was based on an endpoint modeling method. The results show that if diesel vehicles that comply with the new Japanese long-term emissions gas standard are commonly used in the future, the benefit of FAME-type BDF will be relatively limited. Furthermore, the scenario that introduced HBD was most effective in reducing total environmental <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> that a shift from FAME-type BDF to HBD would be more beneficial...|$|E

The paper explains as to why despite having five members, the two countries Kenya and Tanzania dominates trade among EAC members. Using the aggregated gravity model, the study finds that, Tanzania and Kenya Trade are much determined by the economic size (GDP) of the EAC members rather than the Per capita GDPs of these countries. The coefficient of a distance variable has negative <b>impact</b> <b>meaning</b> the costs of trading, time related costs and costs related to market access are higher. In a disintegrated model, the economic size of the respective countries, Kenya and Tanzania,exerts a positive impact but Tanzania’s GDP have a higher value of coefficient than Kenya. The Tanzania’s importers GDPs coefficient is positive but not significant for Tanzania, while it is positive and significant for Kenya’s export Trade. Importers population showed a remarkable contribution to bilateral trade between Tanzania, Kenya {{and the rest of}} EAC. However, per capita income coefficient explains that Kenya and Tanzania does not trade high income oriented products for the coefficient had a negative sign which is significant. The distance, representing the cost of trading, is affects Tanzania export negatively more than how it does for Kenya.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} study which explores {{the changes in}} personal meaning for ten women who left Roman Catholic sisterhoods after spending from 14 to 36 years as nuns. A brief history of religious life is given, {{with an emphasis on}} the changes brought about by Vatican Council in the 1960 s. These institutional changes began an exodus from religious life unprecedented {{in the history of the}} Church. Prior to this time, it was almost unheard of for a woman who had made final vows in her community to leave. Although the grand exodus took place in the late 60 s and 70 s, women religious, well beyond final vows, continue to leave their communities today. Since religious life encompasses more than one 2 ̆ 7 s work and embraces all aspects of life, the hypothesis underlying this research is that women who spent many years in community would, by necessity, have to reconstruct life meaning upon exiting the sisterhood. There is no previous research which addresses how meaning changes, what these shifts in meaning look like, and what <b>impact</b> <b>meaning</b> shifts have on adjustment in transition for this group of mid-life women. A phenomenological method of analysis applied to the interview data produced themes and meanings for four time periods: pre-entrance, convent life, departure, and the present. It was concluded that meaning was constantly reconstructed and adapted throughout the four time periods, which allowed the women a sense of continuity and justification for behavioral and cognitive change. Most significantly, it appears that there was a major movement from external reference to internal reference, as theparticipants co-authored their lives, and created personal meaning. The experience of current satisfaction and well-being seemed to be a function of the individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to revision their lives and construct sufficient meaning for their present choices...|$|E

40|$|Creativity is a {{major source}} of {{competitive}} advantage and a crucial key for organizational success and survival. The ability to achieve competitive advantage largely depends on the way the organization exploits and uses its available resources. Among many resources within an organization, employees’ unique skills and creative abilities are key resources. The term 'creativity' is not easily defined, which is evident by the various different definitions of the term, and also varies depending on the subject area. This {{is also one of the}} reasons why leaders avoid bringing forth creativity, because of its ambiguous character, it is considered to be too elusive and intangible to pin down, in other words unmanageable. Consequently, this causes uncertainty among leaders which makes them repellent to stimulating creativity. However, this does not exclude the fact that the importance of leadership not has been given sufficient attention. Several researches indicate that leadership actually plays a key role in stimulating creativity by its impact on organization climate. Therefore, the question raised in this study is how leadership can stimulate a creative organizational climate for employees. In this study a literature review has been made where relevant theory has been included in the theoretical chapter. The theory is based primarily on Amabile's ‘The KEYS model’ combined with Ekvall's ‘Ten dimensions’. The two theories are analyzed together and supplemented with other theories where factors are either retained or omitted. Each respective theoretical position makes an important contribution to the understanding of creativity stimulation, from which a conceptual model has been designed. The methodological approach used within this study has been abduction. With a focus on qualitative research as an approach, an operationalization was created and also used during the semi-structured interviews. For this study three different company leaders (two HR-leaders and one innovation leader) have been interviewed. The factors that indicate a positive impact on creativity are idea support, risk-taking, playfulness and humor, feedback, rewards and emotional safety. This has been confirmed by the arguments stated in the theory as well as empirical findings. Other factors such as independence, sufficient time, necessary resources, amount of challenges and strictness show a pending <b>impact,</b> <b>meaning</b> that the factor requires a balance in order to avoid inhibiting creativity. Amount of challenges and strictness were originally assigned positive and negative impact, but as now have been assigned pending impact depending on how the theory compared to the empirical findings has been addressed to them. Finally, the negative related factor, conflicts, has been omitted as the factor did not turn out to contribute to a creative climate. Based on this analysis, a model has been created with the intention to fulfil the purpose of this study as it shows how leaders can stimulate creativity by reproducing the factors contributing to creativity...|$|E
