2500|$|Exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum, where Jesus exorcises an evil spirit who cries out, [...] "What do {{you want}} with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are—the Holy One of God!".|$|E
6000|$|... "Silence!" [...] blazed the Frenchman. [...] "Now t'at <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, t'at make a {{so great}} difference. Where is t'e guard, Wentwort'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've deceived me!" [...] I cried sternly. [...] "Jack, you've {{given me}} a false name. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, now. You're no Jack at all. You're Courtenay Ivor!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kent," [...] he continued, [...] "from {{the first}} moment of your mock investigation, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were. Your every step was shadowed, your every {{movement}} dogged. Transome Kent--by your true name, Peter Kelly, murderer, I denounce you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> must be {{the very}} first moment I saw you," [...] she answered, blushing; [...] "you're so much like him in some ways, though not in all.... And {{he told me that}} day he had a twin brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maiden," [...] replied Maduna, in a shamed voice, [...] "that {{was your}} fault, not mine. If you had {{appealed to me}} I would have let you go. But you killed my sentry, and then the chase began, and ere <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were my runners were out of call." ...|$|R
6000|$|MacIan screamed. [...] "Ah!" [...] he cried. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are. You are not God. You are {{not one of}} God's angels. But {{you were}} once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Doubt not my faith, sir,' said Eustacie, proudly; 'I {{have been}} as true to him as if I had known he lived. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are to {{question}} me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are?' {{she asked}} him, carelessly. 'How do I {{know what you}} want to know my story for? Perhaps you're only trying to get {{something}} out of me.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Charrisse: “If <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, then you're {{not worth}} knowing.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{called the}} Su-dic, which {{is short for}} Supreme Dictator. I sent that man away because the moment you {{mentioned}} Ozma of Oz, and the Emerald City, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. <b>I</b> suppose I'm the only Flathead that ever heard of you, but that's because I have more brains than the rest." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Makes no answer, {{but remains}} standing. There is a pause. Then {{the eyes of}} the two women meet. LADY CHILTERN looks stern and pale. MRS. CHEVELEY seem rather amused.] Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really were, <b>I</b> should not have invited you to my house last night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} seen him here to-day. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> mean well enough, {{but he is not}} here. I can lay you the odds if you like. You would be safe with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who goes there?" [...] he cried, in a high-pitched, nervous voice. [...] "Don't come {{any closer}} until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] and {{he raised his}} pistol and pointed it at those who approached.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm Belding, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] replied Belding in hearty amaze, as he {{stretched}} forth his big hand. [...] "You're Dick Gale's Dad--the Governor, Dick used to say. I'm sure glad to meet you." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm tired. I'm tired. Those of <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> love <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. May God bless you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was talkin' 'bout it when I left; {{said there}} was no need of goin' to the ferry till mornin', 'cause he could put his hands on him when he wanted to. Some of Jip's chums must have gone back on him, an' I wouldn't wonder if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who.</b> <b>You</b> see, Denny Macey was tellin' 'round that if Jip didn't ante up the dime he {{borrowed}} two weeks ago, he'd make trouble for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, pardon me. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. <b>I</b> only suppose--but {{no doubt}} correctly--that {{you are the}} gentleman whose title is on the doorplate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} I have met you," [...] said Olive, [...] "and that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. And I am glad, too, {{to tell you}} that I forgive you for not taking notice of me seven years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon not. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, {{and that}} you are an old {{associate}} of hers, {{in the days of}} her sin and unregeneration. I want you to answer me, before God and man, what was your purpose in coming there to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does--oh! it does. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, I find no {{difficulty}} in tracing in your features the resemblance to your portrait {{in the family}} gallery, at the Nest. The eyes, too, cannot be altered without artificial brows, and those you have not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] said Breeze dryly, [...] "that, nevertheless, <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, {{and that}} even now I am ignorant whom I am addressing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Slavin {{looked at}} him almost appreciatively. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I fancy you're {{not going to make}} any trouble here. In fact, it's very {{probable}} that you will leave this settlement early to-morrow, though {{it would have been a}} good deal better had I choked you off from coming here. I would have done it had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were. You will take any steps that seem necessary if these gentlemen try to get away, Trooper Nixon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Jimmy admitted, [...] "of course, <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{what you}} were not, which {{was the thing that}} counted most then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph; don't {{you suppose}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are?" [...] he went on. [...] "You're {{the son of}} a thief. Do you hear that?-- {{the son of a}} thief! What right have you got to set {{yourself}} up to be any better than your father was afore you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{returned}} Wisbech, [...] "then I fancy <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> must be. In fact, I'm rather glad I {{came across}} you. You are evidently {{the man who}} looked after my nephew when he was ill, and from what Miss Waynefleet told me, Derrick owes you a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] he replied, without moving. [...] "You are Caroline, Duchess of Winchester. I keep my hat upon my head because I owe you {{no respect}} and I feel none. As to asking you in, {{no one of}} your family will ever, of my will, step inside these palings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, {{but if you}} got any idee {{that this}} bunch of cut-throats is likely to turn into any W. C. T. U. pink-tea party--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lord, if <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, <b>I</b> {{should have}} rushed out, and caught {{you in my}} arms,' said Bob Sawyer; 'but upon my life, I thought you were the King's-taxes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{this they}} were silent for a little, and then by and by the Lady Elaine said: [...] "Sir Knight Malfait, <b>I</b> would <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are and who are your fellows of whom you speak." [...] At that Sir Launcelot smiled and said: [...] "Lady, I may not tell you at this present who I am nor who they are, but only {{that they are very}} good worthy knights and gentlemen." [...] "Aye," [...] quoth the Lady Elaine, [...] "that I may very well believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, Madame, {{welcome to}} it all--welcome as the flowers in May. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, though I forget your name; it {{is a name}} dear to all La Vendée. Your husband is a great and good man; indeed, you shall have my bed, though you'll find it very cold. Your husband--but, oh dear! I beg your pardon, Madame, I forgot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] said my companion, with my card in his hand. [...] "Fact is, I was {{round at}} your place this morning {{trying to get}} rooms, and the clerk {{told me all about}} you from my description. I felt as mean as pu'sley goin'; seemed to be takin' kind of an {{advantage}} of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who are you, anyhow," [...] {{he cried}} out, [...] "to {{threaten}} to strike {{me and to}} insult me, who am as good as you? You dare not strike me! You may shoot a man from behind, as you shot poor Captain Brand on the Rio Cobra River, but you won't dare strike me face to face. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> {{are and what you}} are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-afternoon," [...] replied Julia, [...] "but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are; do <b>I?</b> O yes, I do though. You are {{the nice}} man {{that gave us}} leave to sketch from the old houseboat." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel became grave. [...] "No, my boy, I did not. But <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> did. <b>You</b> {{remember}} the two literary chaps who camped {{with us on}} our trial march two years ago?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bessie. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are; but <b>I</b> {{may tell}} you that his mind has been troubled for years about an only son who ran away from home--a long time ago. Everybody knows that here.|$|R
