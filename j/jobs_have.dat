5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment.

With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E

30|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to job quality we find a clear {{cascading}} pattern across skill groups after 2000, which may hint at an oversupply of high-skilled workers (since skills have grown over time, see above). Although the share of all young workers in top-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> remained relatively stable over the 2000 s (after an increase over the 1990 s), for the groups of high-skilled workers there have been clear declines in the respective shares. This means that less young workers <b>have</b> obtained a top-paying <b>job</b> after 2000. On the contrary, their share in medium-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> risen continuously. Concurrently with that, the share of medium- and low-paying workers in medium-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> shrunk, while – vice versa – their share in bottom-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> increased. These patterns clearly indicate that relatively better skilled groups have crowded out relatively lower skilled groups in Germany – at least over {{the first decade of}} this century.|$|R
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010.

It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital.
