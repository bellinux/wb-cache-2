5|$|Goebbels had {{frequent}} {{discussions with}} Hitler {{about the fate}} of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> {{was one of the few}} top Nazi officials to do so publicly.|$|E
5|$|Kumaran is {{attracted}} to Valli, and asks Kali {{for permission to}} marry her. Because he hates his former boss, Kali arranges for Valli to marry Murugesa, a philandering grocer. Although Manga opposes Kali's <b>decision,</b> <b>he</b> stubbornly refuses her plea to allow his sister to marry Kumaran. Manga decides to arrange the marriage without his consent.|$|E
5|$|Auriemma {{found himself}} in a {{national}} debate following a <b>decision</b> <b>he</b> made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E

"Bruce Floor had {{opinions}} {{during the}} recording process, but he let us {{make our own}} <b>decisions.</b> <b>He</b> {{put us in a}} position to make our own <b>decisions</b> and <b>he</b> supported us when we made them.

5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the <b>decision</b> <b>he</b> made.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, American {{soldiers}} established Camp Warner, {{a military}} camp near present-day Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Lake County. They were sent from Boise, Idaho, {{to build a}} military camp in the high desert, and built it east of the Warner Lakes, because they doubted that they could cross the series of wetlands. Maj. Gen. George Crook disapproved of the soldiers' <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> built a road across the lakes and moved the camp to {{the western side of}} them.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's next {{fight was}} {{not against the}} new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Rashad Evans, as the pre-fight reports suggested. UFC President Dana White {{indicated}} that the original plan was for Jackson to receive an immediate title shot, but Evans requested time off to recover from injuries he sustained from his fight against Forrest Griffin. Instead, Jackson faced Keith Jardine at UFC 96, and was victorious by unanimous <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> was then scheduled to face Rashad Evans at UFC 98, but it was later revealed on March 11, 2009 that Jackson needed surgery to repair torn ligaments in his jaw, effectively cancelling the bout against Evans.|$|E
5|$|Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was keen to sign Forster who he {{had seen}} play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers. Forster then signed for Norwich City in a one-month loan deal. It was then {{extended}} {{to the end of}} January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick going straight to Jermaine Beckford who scored.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the January 30, 2012 {{episode of}} Raw to evaluate Laurinaitis' performance as general manager. Before he could announce the <b>decision,</b> <b>he</b> {{was interrupted by}} the returning Undertaker. After initially refusing the rematch as {{he did not want}} to tarnish The Undertaker's legacy, Triple H accepted the challenge after being called a coward who lives in Shawn Michaels' shadow, on the condition their rematch be contested inside Hell in a Cell. Triple H went on to lose this match at WrestleMania XXVIII.|$|E

50|$|Former Defence Minister George Terhoff {{travels to}} Srebrenica {{with his wife}} and daughter. He is confronted with the {{consequences}} of the <b>decisions</b> <b>he</b> made {{at the time of the}} war. The sudden disappearance of his daughter forces him to start a search. As he passes through all the places that bear silent witness to the fall of Srebrenica, he remembers the traumatic hours he spent in the bunker where he was expected to make life and death <b>decisions.</b> <b>He</b> now experiences the frantic uncertainty that Ibro must have faced. He is eventually brutally confronted with his own past.|$|R
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{to return}} to {{official}} cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979–80, a <b>decision</b> <b>he</b> later regretted. It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell. Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania, he received a three-week suspension. In his first match after the ban, he was again reported for his conduct {{in a game against}} the touring English team. Given a suspended ban by the ACB, he was then selected for Australia's last three Tests of the season. His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980. In his final first-class match, SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield. Although Chappell scored 112, SA lost the match and the shield. Ironically, the umpires voted him the competition's player of the season for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{continued}} his productive sequence in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, scoring an unbeaten 56 and 100 in a drawn match. It {{was the first}} Test in which Harvey had played that Australia did not win. After scoring 100 not out against Griqualand West, Harvey finished the series with 116 in the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, as Australia won by an innings and took the series 4–0. He had amassed four centuries in consecutive Tests in the series and had scored six in his first nine Tests, totally 959 runs at 106.55. Harvey's fast scoring made him a crowd favourite and marketing drawcard in South Africa. When Harvey was rested for a tour match in East London, media complaints prompted Australian selectors to reverse their <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> finished the season with 55 in an Australian total of 55 before the tourists dismissed a South African XI for 49 and 90 to complete an innings victory.|$|E

5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference <b>decision,</b> <b>he</b> risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|López {{suffered}} from shoulder problems during spring training in 1982, {{and he was}} demoted to Detroit's Class AAA minor-league affiliate in Evansville by July. He was called back up to Detroit on September 1, but later that month he shocked his teammates by announcing that he was giving up his MLB career and returning to Mexico. López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and the Mexican economy as motivating factors for the <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> came out of retirement and returned to Detroit {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive a pay cut through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E
5|$|On {{volunteering}} {{for service}} in the war, Hargest sought to serve abroad in command {{of one of the}} infantry brigades of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). However, the newly appointed commander of the 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg was concerned about the age and command experience of some potential senior officers of the 2NZEF such as Hargest. A subsequent medical assessment deemed Hargest fit only for service on the Home Front as he was still prone to bouts of shell shock from his service during the First World War. Disappointed with this <b>decision,</b> <b>he</b> approached Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, with a request for a brigade command in 2NZEF. Fraser disregarded official advice and arranged for Hargest to be appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. At the time, the Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, Major-General John Duigan, wrote to Freyberg, disassociating himself from the decision.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, {{during an}} appeal by the Birmingham Six (who were later acquitted) Lord Denning judged {{that the men}} should be stopped from {{challenging}} legal <b>decisions.</b> <b>He</b> listed several reasons for not allowing their appeal: ...|$|R

5|$|Pelé {{scored the}} first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. Brazil lost that game and Pelé, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender João Morais fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe. Pelé had to stay on the field limping {{for the rest of the}} game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a <b>decision</b> <b>he</b> would later change.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter <b>decision.</b> <b>He</b> was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a <b>decision</b> <b>he</b> made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E
