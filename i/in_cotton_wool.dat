2500|$|His mother, Alexandra, {{was seven}} months' {{pregnant}} {{with him when}} while she was out with friends, she jumped into a boat, falling as she got in. The next day, she collapsed {{in the middle of}} a ball from violent labour pains brought on by the previous day's activities; Dmitri was born in the hours following the accident. Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. Although doctors had no hope for Dmitri's survival, he still lived, with the help of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dmitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated. [...] "I am enjoying raising Dmitri," [...] Sergei wrote in his diary. Alexandra died shortly after Dmitri's birth. She was only 21, and the cause was almost certainly preeclampsia.|$|E
2500|$|While Nancy is with Mitzeee, {{she gets}} [...] "sudden twinges" [...] which {{she does not}} worry about until [...] "the contractions really start to kick in. She's only 26 weeks' {{pregnant}} and she's totally terrified". Nancy calls Darren who takes her to hospital where she is [...] "doubled over in agony". The doctors try giving Nancy medication to stop the contractions which fails. Nancy has an emergency Caesarean and gives birth to a boy who the doctors are unsure if he will [...] "make it through the night" [...] which Fox said is a [...] "terrible time for Nancy and Darren". Darren blames Nancy for their babies premature birth, Dawson explained that this is because he believes that Nancy did not [...] "take proper care of herself during her pregnancy". He said that Nancy seemed to be preoccupied with Mitzeee and [...] "wouldn't listen {{to him when he}} told her to back off. In his heart of hearts, Darren feels she's responsible for all of this". Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll {{be a bit of a}} neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> and not let him out of her sight".|$|E

60|$|They {{took him}} into the house, and a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb {{and said he was}} not dead but half choked. So they wrapped him <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool,</b> and warmed him over a little fire, and {{he opened his eyes and}} sneezed.|$|E
25|$|The {{techniques}} used to process these fibers in yarn are {{essentially the same}} as with natural fibers, modifications have to be made as these fibers are of great length, and have no texture such as the scales <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>wool</b> that aid meshing.|$|R
50|$|Wool yarn is {{the most}} used for weaving and usually makes the finest material. For grave {{textiles}} they were usually done <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>wool</b> weft, supplementary weft float pattering and plain weave techniques. These patterns are also found throughout the coastal regions of Peru.|$|R
50|$|Razai (Hindustani: रज़ाई; رزائی, ruh-zaa-ee; or ਰਜਾਈ, Ra-jaa-ee in Punjabi) is a bedquilt used in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, North India and Nepal. It {{is a type}} of bedding {{similar to}} a duvet or comforter. Razais usually have a cotton, silk or velvet cover which is stuffed with <b>cotton</b> <b>wool.</b> They can provide a great deal of warmth even in the very cold weather that can occur in these regions, {{primarily}} due to the insulating effects of the large amount of air trapped <b>in</b> the <b>cotton</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|R

You took Hal and Robbie all over the Sierras and on that Mexico trip." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Corbeck {{packed the}} lamps <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool,</b> {{and placed them}} in a tin box. This, I may mention incidentally, was then brought up to the detectives' room, {{where one of the}} men stood guard over them with a {{revolver}} the whole night. Next day we got a small safe into the house, and placed them in it. There were two different keys. One of them I kept myself; the other I placed in my drawer in the Safe Deposit vault. We were all determined that the lamps should not be lost again.|$|E
60|$|Now it chanced that Roger Vanderwater {{was lying}} ill in his palace {{at the other}} end of Kingsbury--not the dire illness that strikes down you and me, brothers; just a bit of biliousness, mayhap, or no more than a bad {{headache}} because he had eaten too heartily or drunk too deeply. But it was enough for him, being tender and soft from careful rearing. Such men, packed <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> all their lives, are exceeding tender and soft. Believe me, brothers, Roger Vanderwater felt as badly with his aching head, or THOUGHT he felt as badly, as Tom Dixon really felt with his arm torn out by the roots.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} {{works on}} the conditions in prisons in France, {{and the benefits of}} helping prisoners return to outside life when their sentences ended.

50|$|The {{earliest}} sampler extant is a spot sampler, i.e. one having randomly scattered motifs, of the Nazca {{culture in}} Peru formerly in the Museum of Primitive Art, New York City. It {{is estimated to}} date from ca. 200 BCE -300 CE and is worked <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>wool</b> pattern darning on a woven cotton ground. It has seventy-four figures of birds, plants and mythological beings.|$|R

Yet when the blade comes off, like this, you see that {{although}} the weight is absolutely adjusted, the inside is hollow. The dagger itself is encased <b>in</b> this <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> to avoid any rattling. I put it away in rather a hurry the last time I used it, and as you see I forgot to clean it." ...|$|R

He kept it <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> till the fourteenth an' then I connected.|$|E
60|$|We had a {{good many}} discussions about our grapnel. We {{did not know whether}} there was a {{sentinel}} on duty in the fort at night or not, but supposed there was, and, if so, he would be likely to hear the grapnel when we threw it up and it hit the stones. We thought we could get over this difficulty by wrapping the grapnel <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool.</b> This would deaden the sound when it struck, but would not prevent the points of the hooks from holding to the inner edge of the wall. Everything now seemed all right, except that we had no object in view after we got over the wall. I always like to have some reason for doing a thing, especially when it's pretty hard to do. I said this to Rectus, and he agreed with me.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he became}} egotistical, this ragged ruffian who {{conceived}} {{that he knew}} the road to illimitable wealth and {{told the story of}} his life, interspersed with anecdotes that would blister the paper they were written on. But through all his ravings, he stuck to his hundred-and-fifty-million theory, and though the listener dissented from him and the brutal cruelty with which his views were stated, an unscientific impression remained not to be shaken off. Across the Border one feels that the country is being used, exploited, [...] "made to sit up," [...] so to speak. In our territories the feeling is equally strong of wealth [...] "just round the corner," [...] as the loafer said, of a people wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> and ungetatable. Will any man, who really knows something of a little piece of India and has not the fear of running counter to custom before his eyes, explain how this impression is produced, and why it is an erroneous one? ...|$|E
50|$|The Lowell Textile School {{opened on}} October 4, 1897. Originally, {{the first class}} had over 200 students. The school was modeled {{on the success of}} the Polytechnical School at Philadelphia. The school {{originally}} opened in three rented rooms on Middle Street in downtown Lowell. The college offered three year diplomas <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> or <b>wool</b> manufacture, design, or textile chemistry and dyeing. Tuition at the time was one hundred dollars.|$|R
5000|$|The jester blouse was {{a popular}} item in 1950s and early 1960s women's fashion. Fashion {{designer}} Louella Ballerino found an illustration of a court jesterwhich inspired her to design her [...] "sun and fun" [...] fashions. The jester theme appeared in long pointed collars tipped with bell-like buttons, harlequin prints, and in the jagged points which occasionally outlined an apron overskirt. Ballerino created plunged-to-the-waist jester blouses <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> or <b>wool</b> jersey topped sun backed dresses.|$|R

60|$|There {{are certain}} {{instruments}} used by scientists so delicate {{that they have}} to be wrapped <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> and kept in ductless places, and so sensitive that the slightest shock will derange them. And there are certain souls which cannot stand the jars of life--souls created to register thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser construction. Such was the soul of the storekeeper of Coniston. Whether or not {{he was one of those}} immortalized in the famous Elegy, it is not for us to say. A celebrated poet who read the letters to the Guardian--at Miss Lucretia Penniman's request--has declared Mr. Wetherell to have been a genius. He wrote those letters, as we know, after he had piled his boxes and rolled his barrels into place; after he had added up the columns in his ledger and recorded, each week, the small but ever increasing deficit which he owed to Jethro Bass. Could he have been removed from the barrels and the ledgers, and the debts and the cares and the implications, what might we have had from his pen? That will never be known.|$|E

50|$|In 1857 Marianne {{married the}} {{industrialist}} Michael Hainisch (owner of a spinning factory in Aue) {{with whom she}} had two children (Michael, 1858, and Maria, 1860). In 1868 the family moved to Vienna. During the American Civil War (1861 - 65), the business was <b>in</b> crisis, as <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> could no longer be sourced from the United States.|$|R

50|$|In the 17th century Bhats Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were Saraswat Mohyal Brahmin {{and were}} disciples {{of the ninth}} Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621-1675).

Bhat Bhai Sati Das was wrapped <b>in</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>wool</b> and set on fire by the Mughal authorities for refusing to denounce his faith. His brother Bhat Bhai Mati Das was also tortured to death, by having his head sawn in two.|$|E

He was made 9/4 favourite and led inside the final furlong to beat Stonehatch and Nicolotte in a driving finish.

A kind of networked citizenship to match my idea of networked journalism. But hang on, to be ‘post’ {{something you have to}} identify what you are moving past. What is bureaucracy? In common parlance it is ‘red tape’ – the procedural stuff that stops you doing what you want. It kills small business and wraps us <b>in</b> H&S <b>cotton</b> <b>wool.</b> Or is it a cradle-to- grave system that protects us and promotes prosperity that we enjoy in our Big State world...|$|R
