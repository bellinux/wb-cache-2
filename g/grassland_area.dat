25|$|Even {{though the}} North-West University Botanical Garden spans {{less than three}} {{hectares}} more than a 1500 plant species can be found here. Most plants in the Botanical Garden are indigenous to South Africa {{with the exception of}} a few exotic plants which are kept for research or educational value. A large section of the garden, around a man-made ridge, is managed as a natural wooded <b>grassland</b> <b>area.</b> A variety of theme gardens make up the rest of the Botanical Garden, including the swamp garden, vlei garden, contemporary indigenous garden, vegetable and herb garden, invader display, plant evolution garden and succulent rockery. Some more common plant genera represented in the garden include Acacia, Aloe, Bonatea, Crinum, Dierama, Encephalartos, Eucomis, Eulophia, Euphorbia, Gasteria, Gladiolus, Haworthia, Hypoxis, Indigofera, Kniphofia, Plectranthus, Podocarpus, Polygala, Scadoxus, Searsia, Stapelia and Zantedeschia.|$|E
500|$|The town of Peterson is at km 76 and Highway 670 is at km 87. The {{ecoregion}} {{changes to}} aspen parkland. [...] Grasslands are resident {{on the upper}} slopes, and aspen groves on the lower areas. [...] There {{tend to be more}} aspen groves in the aspen parkland as compared to the mixed <b>grassland</b> <b>area.</b> At km 109, the highway passes through the town of Dixon.|$|E
500|$|Banagher is {{situated}} in north-west County Offaly on the east bank of the River Shannon. It is [...] south west of Dublin, [...] south east of Ballinasloe, [...] south of Athlone and [...] north east of Limerick. It provides a crossing point between Offaly in Leinster and Galway in Connacht. Although Banagher {{is located in the}} flood-plain of the River Shannon, the town itself was developed on high ground and remains virtually flood-free all year round. North of Lough Derg, the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and regularly floods parts of the surrounding countryside. The resultant wet <b>grassland</b> <b>area,</b> known as the Shannon Callows, is an internationally recognised wild bird and wildlife habitat and is classified as a Special Area of Conservation.|$|E

50|$|In {{a lot of}} {{different}} countries with dry <b>grassland</b> <b>areas</b> the land is used for agriculture, which {{have an effect on the}} biome and the flora and fauna species living there. In Finland, for example, the grazing of livestock changed the structure of the landscape. This eventually resulted in a decline in species. In the United Kingdom lots of semi-natural dry <b>grassland</b> <b>areas</b> are used for agriculture, which creates conservation problems, such as the rare dry grassland species becoming extinct. Research suggests that, at least in Europe, a common solution should be looked for in order to conserve dry <b>grassland</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
