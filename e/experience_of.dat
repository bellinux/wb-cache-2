We administered questionnaire to 389 children on the relationship between the <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> kandoh and self-efficacy or self-esteem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{relationships}} among the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency, emotional intelligence, shyness, and self-esteem. Participants were 322 undergraduates. The perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency were assessed by the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency scales developed by Maki et al. （ 2003 ）. This scale have 15 items corresponding to perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and 15 items corresponding to perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> incontingency. The emotional intelligence were measured by two scales, WLEIS（Wong & Law, 2002 ）and J-ESCQ（Toyota, et al., 2005 ）originally developed by Taksic（ 2002 ）. Analysis of results based on Structure equation modeling （SEM）indicated that the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency influended self-esteem and shyness via emotional intelligence, although those experiences have small direct influences on both of them. The levels of self-esteem and shyness in 8 groups by 2 levels（low and high）and 3 scales（the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency, those of incontingency and emotional intelligence）were compared. These comparisons revealed that the high levels <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and emotional intelligence led to higher level of self-esteem and lower level of shyness, and that the effects <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency on shyness were affected by the levels of emotional intelligence. Although the level of self-esteem was influenced by the level <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> incontingency, the level of shyness was not. These results were interpreted as showing that the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency mainly influenced shyness and self-esteem via emotional intelligence...|$|R

5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the divine light.|$|E

40|$|Although {{scholarly}} {{interest in}} doctoral education {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades, much of this attention has focused on the <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> doctoral students who are en-rolled full-time in their programs.

5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E

"What significance does locating self in this research have in terms <b>of</b> contextualising Māori <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> historical intergenerational trauma?"

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship.

Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

40|$|Background: Research {{shows that}} the nurse’s {{presence}} has a great significance {{for the relationship between}} patient and nurse. By this, the nurse can gain a greater understanding for the patient’s situation and thus have an opportunity to influence the patient’s health processes. Problem: Today’s focus on the technology and lack of time in healthcare can create a stress which can {{make it more difficult for}} the nurse to prove presence to the patient. Aim: To describe patients’ <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> the nurse’s presence in healthcare. Method: A qualitative approach, where Evans descriptive synthesis has been used. Eleven previously published qualitative, caring science, articles has been used in the synthesis. Results: The synthesis revealed two themes. The theme <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> presence is described in the two subthemes: <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> a good relationship and <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> safety and trust. The theme <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> lack of presence is described in the two themes: <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> poor treatment and <b>Experiences</b> <b>of</b> disinterest. Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that nurse’s presence has a great significance for the patient. When the nurse has been present the patient’s needs were shown more clearly, and the patient’s need also could be satisfied. If the nurse instead showed lack of presence the patient felt like not being seen and experienced feelings like anger and frustration.

40|$|There is {{a limited}} body of {{research}} that focuses on <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> families of people with mental illness. While the body of knowledge concerning children of parents with mental illness is increasing, there remains limited discourse surrounding the <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> adults who have lived with childhood parental mental illness. This paper examined one major theme of a study focusing on parenting narratives of adults who had experienced childhood parental mental illness. The narrative study from a metropolitan area of Australia reflects adult children's <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> being overwhelmed with parental mental illness. They felt unsure of their own emotions and felt they had lost a sense of who they were as individual people. Adult children felt confused about their sense of reality, particularly for those whose parent had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis. Their <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> loss were closely associated with changing self identity. Furthermore, many of the narratives demonstrated <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> grief for adult children.

40|$|Inflammation is etiologically {{implicated in}} cardiometabolic {{diseases}} {{for which there}} are known racial/ethnic disparities. Prior studies suggest {{there may be an}} association between self-reported <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> racial/ethnic discrimination and inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP). It is not known whether that association is influenced by race/ethnicity and gender. In separate hierarchical linear models with time-varying covariates, we examined that association among 901 Black women, 614 Black men, 958 White women, and 863 White men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study in four US communities. Self-reported <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> racial/ethnic discrimination were ascertained in 1992 - 93 and 2000 - 01. Inflammation was measured as log-transformed CRP in those years and 2005 - 06. All analyses were adjusted for blood pressure, plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), age, education, and community. Our findings extend prior research by suggesting that, broadly speaking, self-reported <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> racial/ethnic discrimination are associated with inflammation; however, this association is complex and varies for Black and White women and men. Black women reporting 1 or 2 <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> discrimination had higher levels of CRP compared to Black women reporting no <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> discrimination (beta = 0. 141, SE = 0. 062, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). This association was not statistically significant among Black women reporting 3 or more <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> discrimination and not independent of modifiable risks (smoking and obesity) in the final model. White women reporting 3 or more <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> discrimination had significantly higher levels of CRP compared to White women reporting no <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> discrimination independent of modifiable risks in the final model (beta = 0. 300, SE = 0. 113, P 3 ̆c 0. 01).

More complete approaches to women’s <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> relationships of power do not negate the relationships of power, inequality, and <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> domestic abuse existing between men and women; such approaches also do not prioritise over these relationships the relationships of oppression that exist between culturally and/or socioeconomically different women.
