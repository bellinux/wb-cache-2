5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, and was going to balance <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had to restructure the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and other problems in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime adaptation, and to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E
5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine {{on the brink of}} seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E

5|$|Without Graham, the Browns floundered in 1956. Injuries to two Browns quarterbacks left {{relative}} unknown Tommy O'Connell as the starter, and Cleveland {{finished with}} a 5–7 record, its first losing season. Dante Lavelli and Frank Gatski retired {{at the end of}} the season, leaving Groza as the only original Browns player still on the team. While the Browns' on-field play in 1956 was uninspiring, off-the-field drama developed after a Cleveland-based inventor let Brown test a helmet with a radio transmitter inside. After trying <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> training camp, Brown used the helmet to call plays during the pre-season with long-time backup George Ratterman behind center. The device allowed the coach to direct his quarterback on the fly, giving him an advantage over franchises who had to use messenger players to relay instructions. The Browns used the device off and on into the regular season, and other teams began to experiment with their own radio helmets. Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner, banned the device in October 1956. Today, however, all NFL teams use in-helmet radios to communicate with players.|$|E

25|$|With {{the change}} of coach for 1977, {{it was decided that}} Hart's body would need nursing through a tough season, and he was used on the backline.

Another knee injury mid-season left Hart with a choice: more major surgery or retirement. He chose the latter and was appointed a skills coach with Richmond.|$|E

25|$|In 1764, Catherine placed Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{her former}} lover, on the Polish throne. Although {{the idea of}} {{partitioning}} Poland came from the King Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took {{a leading role in}} carrying <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the 1790s. In 1768, she formally became protector of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which provoked an anti-Russian uprising in Poland, the Confederation of Bar (1768–72). After the uprising broke down due to internal politics in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, she established in the Rzeczpospolita, a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys.|$|E
