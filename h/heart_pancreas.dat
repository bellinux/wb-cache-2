40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is threefold; 1) to {{establish}} the current level of knowledge regarding cost-effectiveness of organ transplantation, 2) to identify knowledge gaps, and 3) to suggest a framework for future studies. A systematic literature review of economic evaluations of transplantations of solid organs was conducted in October 2010. Economic evaluations published since 2000 and reviews published since 1987 for kidney, liver, lung, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas,</b> and small bowel transplantations were collected. The studies were analysed regarding results and study characteristics. The review demonstrates a lack of economic evaluations for all included organ transplantations. The cost-effectiveness of kidney transplantation, and to some extent liver transplantation, compared to a non-transplant alternative appears to be established. However, cost-effectiveness for transplantation of lung, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas,</b> and small bowel can neither be established nor rejected based on earlier studies. Many of the included studies were limited in a number of ways; e. g. using short follow-up period, failing to account for sample selection in treatment groups, comparing to unrealistic alternatives, lacking important cost categories, and using a limiting perspective. Recommendation for future studies are, besides accounting for the above, to conduct sub-group analyses as patient and disease characteristics, among other things, has been shown to affect the cost-effectiveness of organ transplantation.   Link to  Appendix </p...|$|E

30|$|Unlike the biodistribution, PET imaging of 18 F-SIG 343 and 18 F-SIG 353 showed lower tumour uptake (0.9 %ID/cc and 1.3 %ID/cc, respectively), {{resulting}} in low tumour-to-background contrast which hampered {{the potential of the}} radiotracers as tumour markers. PET images showed high radioactive uptake in the abdominal cavity; hence, high background activity which is consistent with the biodistribution data where high uptake in the liver, spleen, lung, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas</b> and kidney was observed. The discrepancy in the results between in vivo PET and ex vivo biodistribution studies may be attributed to several reasons, including methodological differences in the techniques employed or method quantification/analysis of the images.|$|E

The Ki values for all four tissues were approx. 4 μM. However, dissociation kinetics revealed that TMB- 8 interacted with an allosteric site of three muscarinic receptor subtypes but not the subtype from pancreas. These results indicate that TMB- 8 interacts with muscarinic receptors, and therefore would disrupt calcium mobilization or any second messenger system coupled to these receptors...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of starter feeding time on body growth and viscera development of newly hatched chicks. A total of 1080 Yangzhou chicks with similar weight derived from 1800 eggs were selected in this experiment. These chicks {{were randomly assigned to}} six groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) according to six feeding schedules (fasting for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 hours posthatch), with 3 replicates per group and 60 chicks (30 males and 30 females) per replicate. After fasting, all birds were fed a crumbled starter feedstuff ad libitum until 6 days of age. At 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 d posthatch, eight chicks (4 males and 4 females) per replicate of each experimental group were randomly selected and individually weighed. Yolk sac, liver, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas,</b> bursal and small intestine of each chick were taken out and weighed; the length of small intestine, moreover, was measured. Results showed that food deprivation reduced body weight (BW) of experimental chicks; furthermore BW decreased more and more with a prolonged fasting time. At 6 d of age, the BW of the former five groups was higher than that of the Group 6 (P< 0. 05). At the same time, the growth of viscera apparatuses was influenced by different starter feeding times. There was a significant effect of fasting for 72 h posthatch on BW, small intestine weight and length, liver, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas</b> and bursal weight. The viscera weights of the former three groups (fasting for 12 - 36 h) were, respectively, more than that of latter three groups (fasting for 48 - 72 h) in different ages (P< 0. 05). Results of the present study demonstrated that the feasible starter feeding time should be within 36 h posthatch, and the maximum fasting period could not exceed 60 h posthatch...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn cultured cells, {{infection}} {{by group}} B coxsackievirus (CVB) is {{mediated by the}} coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), but {{the importance of this}} molecule in CVB-induced disease has not been determined. We generated mice with tissue-specific ablation of CAR within each of two major CVB target organs, the <b>pancreas</b> and <b>heart.</b> In the <b>pancreas,</b> deletion of CAR resulted in a significant reduction in both virus titers and virus-induced tissue damage. Similarly, cardiomyocyte-specific CAR deletion resulted in a marked reduction in virus titer, infection-associated cytokine production, and histopathology within the heart. Consistent with the in vivo phenotype, CAR-deficient cardiomyocytes resisted infection in vitro. These results demonstrate a critical function for CAR in the pathogenesis of CVB infection in vivo and in virus tropism for the <b>heart</b> and <b>pancreas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Animals with lateral {{hypothalamic}} lesions lost {{significantly more}} {{weight in the}} 18 h following this lesion than did sham-operated animals or rats with cerebral cortical lesions deprived of food for the same time period. In the acutely fasted sham-operated animals the turnover of norepinephrine in interscapular brown adipose tissue, <b>heart,</b> and <b>pancreas</b> was slowed but in fasted rats with lateral hypothalamic lesions norepinephrine turnover rates were three- to ninefold faster in all three organs. Exposure to the cold (4 degrees C) significantly increased norepinephrine turnover in the interscapular brown adipose tissue, <b>heart,</b> and <b>pancreas</b> of fasted sham-operated rats, but did not further increase the rate of turnover in lateral hypothalamic-lesioned rats. Rats with lesions in the cerebral cortex responded in a fashion {{similar to that of}} the sham-operated animals. Gastric erosions and microhemorrhagic gastric mucosa were observed in five of six acutely fasted rats with lateral hypothalamic lesions whereas all sham-operated rats had a normal appearance of the stomach lining. Animals with lateral hypothalamic lesions made 3 wk earlier also showed an increased rate of norepinephrine turnover in the interscapular brown adipose tissue, <b>heart,</b> and <b>pancreas</b> following an 18 h fast. Rats with bilateral lesions in the paraventricular region of the hypothalamus, however, responded similarly to sham-operated animals with a reduction in the turnover in norepinephrine with fasting and an increase in norepinephrine turnover rate after cold exposure even with fasting. These data suggest that lateral hypothalamic lesions produce an acute increase in turnover of norepinephrine, and that this increased turnover persists for up to 3 wk...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} {{a major cause of}} the {{gastrointestinal}} damage under physical or psychological stress. Ghrelin exhibits gastroprotective effects and {{they are supposed to be}} derived from antioxidant effects. In gastroduodenal mucosal injury, the plasma ghrelin levels increase in response to the demand for gastroduodenal cytoprotection. However, in the condition of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric mucosal severe atrophy, the plasma ghrelin concentration shifted to lower levels. In diabetic gastroparesis, the regulation of ghrelin secretion is impaired with vagal nerve dysfunction. Selective ghrelin agonist is expected to represent a new class of prokinetic agent. In addition, the plasma ghrelin levels are also enhanced by systemic oxidative stress, and ghrelin exhibits antioxidant effects in many organs, such as <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas,</b> and lung. This suggests that ghrelin would be an important player as a sensor of systemic oxidative stress...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Excessive {{accumulation}} of lipids {{can lead to}} lipotoxicity, cell dysfunction and alteration in metabolic pathways, both in adipose tissue and peripheral organs, like liver, <b>heart,</b> <b>pancreas</b> and muscle.

The causes for lipotoxicity are not only a high fat diet but also excessive lipolysis, adipogenesis and adipose tissue insulin resistance. The aims of this review are to investigate the subtle balances that underlie lipolytic, lipogenic and oxidative pathways, to evaluate critical points and the complexities of these processes and to better understand which are the metabolic derangements resulting from their imbalance, such as type 2 diabetes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease...|$|E
