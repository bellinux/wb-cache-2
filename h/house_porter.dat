60|$|The <b>house</b> <b>porter</b> in {{an evening}} coat, and gentlemen with gloves {{as large as}} Doolan's, but of the famous Berlin web, were on the passage of Mr. Bungay's house to receive the guests' hats and coats, and bawl their names up the stair. Some of the latter had arrived when the three new {{visitors}} made their appearance; {{but there was only}} Mrs. Bungay in red satin and a turban to represent her own charming sex. She made curtsies to each new-comer as he entered the drawing-room, but her mind was evidently pre-occupied by extraneous thoughts. The fact is, Mrs. Bacon's dinner-party was disturbing her, and as soon as she had received each individual of her own company, Flora Bungay flew back to the embrasure of the window, whence she could rake the carriages of Emma Bacon's friends as they came rattling up the Row. The sight of Dr. Slocum's large carriage, with the gaunt job-horses, crushed Flora: none but hack cabs had driven up to her own door on that day.|$|E

They stop at a hotel (thanks to Albert's navigating) but end up causing trouble when Albert eats coffee beans and becomes hyperactive. They run into Doug and Wendy again, who offer Melanie and Porter a ride since Porter's car broke down. Later, Melanie and her father ride on a tour bus where they {{try to work out}} their differences. At one destination, Nancy and Katie show up and take Melanie to a {{sorority}} <b>house.</b> <b>Porter,</b> due to a misunderstanding, and the owner not letting him in to check on her, sneaks into the house. After hearing that his daughter has faith in him, he decides to leave the next morning. Unfortunately, after Melanie leaves, he gets caught by the owner, brutally tazed, and arrested. Porter's mother comes to bail him out, and opens up about her own past fears when her son went to the Army, but still believed in her son to go his own path.|$|E

5000|$|Designed by William Peachey, the company's {{resident}} architect, {{the station}} {{consisted of a}} stationmaster's <b>house,</b> <b>porter's</b> lodge, ticket office, toilets, and two waiting rooms. It had two side platforms, replacing the single platform of the original station. Although built inexpensively and without much refinement, it was an improvement on the NER directors' original vision of leaving the stationmaster to continue living in the old station as an economy measure. A similar design to Pinchinthorpe station was used by Peachey at Evenwood railway station in County Durham, which also survives (albeit likewise long closed).|$|R
