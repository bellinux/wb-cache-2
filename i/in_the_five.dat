5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Five</b> Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E
5|$|Away from battle, from 1943 onwards, Miller was {{selected}} to represent the RAAF {{in a series of}} matches against the Royal Air Force and other English teams. The objective of the matches was to show that the British Commonwealth would not be cowed by German attacks, and the team was officially designated as a military unit. In 1945, following the Nazi surrender, the RAAF team merged with members of the Australian Imperial Force team to become the Australian Services, involving army and air force personnel, and competed against England <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> Victory Tests. Following the end-of-war tour of England, the Services team toured the Indian subcontinent before returning to Australia and playing in the 194546 season against the Australian states before being demobilised. Miller was the vice-captain of the team on the return leg of the tour to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland regressed in {{the ensuing}} season, {{finishing}} with a 4–12 record. Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who the Browns had drafted in 2004, put up respectable numbers, but the Browns were close {{to the bottom of}} the league in points scored and offensive yards gained. Frye injured his wrist toward the end of the season and shared starts with quarterback Derek Anderson, who showed promise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> games he played in. During the season, the team produced a series of articles on its website called 60th Moments. The series commemorated the establishment of the Browns 60 years before in 1946, recapturing the 60 greatest moments in franchise history. Beginning on September 6, 2006, the Browns' site ran articles covering those 60 moments; the final article ran on December 31, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{unsuccessful}} tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up {{a working}} party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching.

Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Five</b> Nations during the 1970s.|$|E
