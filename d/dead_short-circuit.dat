40|$|Although {{mathematical}} modelling of biological wastewater treatment processes {{has proved to}} be valuable for large-scale WVVTPs (wastewater treatment plants) little experience has been acquired in the {{mathematical modelling}} of small wastewater treatment plants. This paper seeks to evaluate the applicability of mathematical modelling on small systems, which are characterized by high fluctuations in organic and hydraulic loads and little possibility for control. In order to achieve this, the paper examines the different steps in a general modelling protocol. One important bottleneck for the general use of mathematical modelling of small systems that emerges is the frequent sampling and many analyses needed for characterization of the flows while its applicability is limited. On the other hand, the determination of the model structure of a small WWTP can be quite valuable. Experiments show that tracer tests should include tests with a highly varying influent flow rate to spot independent small internal flows as these can {{have a significant impact on}} the behaviour of peak concentrations throughout the system. In addition, the model structure determination can provide useful information on <b>dead</b> zones, <b>short-circuiting</b> and mixing behaviour in the plant. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{solution for the}} dead zone model which describes the solute transport in a subsurface and horizontal flow constructed wetland. This model is a system of two mass balance equations for two conceptual areas: the main channel and the storage zone. We use finite difference schemes to determine the numerical solution {{of the system and}} we study its convergence by presenting properties related to the stability and accuracy of the schemes. Concerning the experimental results, the magnitude of the longitudinal dispersion and the extension of dead volumes is estimated for clean conditions and after a certain operating period under organic loading conditions. The results showed a considerable amount of longitudinal dispersion through the bed, which was very strong near the feeding point, indicating the occurrence of mixing and significant presence of <b>dead</b> zones and <b>short-circuiting...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) circuit {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economics of a gold refinery. The circuit uses multiphase stirred tanks in series, in which problems such as <b>dead</b> zones, <b>short-circuiting,</b> and presence of unsuspended solids are detrimental to its efficiency. Therefore, the hydrodynamics of such a system is critical for improving the performance. The hydrodynamics of stirred tanks can be resolved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). While the flow generated by the impellers in the CIL tanks is complex and modelling it in the presence of high solid concentration is challenging, advances in CFD models, such as turbulence and particle-fluid interactions, have made modelling of such flows feasible. In the present study, the hydrodynamics of CIL tanks was investigated by modelling it using CFD. The models used in the simulations were validated using experimental data at high solid loading of 40 wt. % in a lab scale tank. The models were further used for examining the flow generated by pitched blade turbine and HA- 715 Mixtec impellers in lab scale CIL tanks with 50 wt. % solids. The effect of design and operating parameters such as off-bottom clearance, impeller separation, impeller speed, scale-up, and multiple-impeller configuration on flow field and solid concentrations profiles was examined. For a given impeller speed, better solids suspension is observed with dual impeller and triple impeller configurations. The results presented in the paper are useful for understanding the hydrodynamics and influence of design and operating parameters on industrial CIL tanks...|$|R
40|$|Stimulus-response {{technique}} {{is a method}} to obtain the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) for {{the elements of a}} fluid passing through a vessel. Generally speaking, in reactor science unsteady-state tests may often appear preferable to steady-state since they are made up of a chain of intermediate ones; but without any theoretical necessity holding. In RTD studies, however, non-steady state tests are the only conceivable ones if conservative tracers are employed, because once a transition is over {{there is no way to}} reconstruct it and assess the hydraulic behaviour of the tank. Only a series of tests with non-conservative tracers of known disappearance rate would achieve the task, but at the price of repeated runs at changing residence times. This paper deals only with Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) subject to a pulse input of a conservative tracer. Mathematical expressions of response are derived starting from mass balance. To allow for the presence of anomalies two models for non-ideal CSTR are also illustrated, namely the <b>dead</b> volume and <b>short-circuiting</b> patterns. Theory and techniques are well established since long and in this paper they are simply recalled and retraced in order to explicitly list and highlight the effects on final equations of some hypotheses and mathematical steps which - though widely known - are sometimes undervalued to some extent...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} European LIFE ArtWET project, two on-site buffer zones, an {{artificial}} wetland and a forest plot, are being evaluated for their capacity to mitigate pesticide pollution. As treatment efficiency is highly dependent on the systems' hydrology, the present work focuses on the watershed and both systems' hydrological functioning. The design strategy involved limited inlet flow rates to 70 L s- 1 : 99 % of watershed outlet flow rates were lower than this limit. Approximately half of the flows of greatest concern passed through the artificial wetland, whereas the forest only received 2 % of these flows. A tracer experiment was conducted under a low steady flow rate while little vegetation was present in the artificial wetland. A water dye tracer (sulforhodamine B, SB) and two molecules of contrasting properties, uranine (Ur, photodegrading) and isoproturon (mobile and only slightly sorptive, IPU) were injected. Dilution, sorption, and photodegradation were observed. The forest plot, which presented a high organic matter content, showed more sorption (IPU, SB) but lower photodecay (Ur) than did the artificial wetland. Total IPU losses in the forest buffer were high (79 %). In the artificial wetland, 30 % IPU losses were found, whereas a 66. 5 -h mean retention time was determined and good hydraulic efficiency (0. 55) was calculated. Few <b>dead</b> zones and <b>short-circuits</b> were found, suggesting good hydrological functioning. Implementing buffer zones in subsurface pipe-drained watersheds actively participates in the reduction of pesticide transfer to natural water bodies...|$|R
40|$|All {{bioreactor}} configurations {{are affected}} by mixing and transport phenomena and consequently the bioreactor’s hydraulics governs the reactor’s configurations as well as performance. For instance, to provide good conditions for substrate transport to, and from, the microbial aggregates, an even mixing pattern at the macro-level is desirable. However, the available data that either describe UASB flow regime or relate process performance to mixing characteristics are not that much. The global objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the liquid flow model of UASB via a tracer study to characterize the overall flow behavior in this reactor. In particular, a tracer study has been utilized in this study to figure out the flow pattern in the UASB reactor and to determine the difference between theoretical and actual hydraulic retention time. The specific objectives of the present work have been reached through four steps; namely: (1) UASB bench-scale model setup, (2) tracer experimental study, (3) results statistical analysis to determine the reactor dispersion and actual retention time, and (4) selection of the model that can be used to describe the investigated reactor. Among the main findings of the present study is that the CSTR model with some degree of <b>short-circuiting,</b> <b>dead</b> zones and bypassing flows seems to describe the overall hydrodynamics of UASBs. Also, the mean residence times were 87. 68 %, 80. 35 %, and 72. 66 % of the theoretical hydraulic retention times 6, 8, and 10 hours, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Mixed-cell Raceway (MCR) is {{a design}} that intends to combine the best {{characteristics}} of circular tanks and linear raceways in a single production system. The conceptual idea is to convert traditional linear raceways {{into a series of}} hydraulically separated cells, each of which behaves as an individual circular tank. The MCR {{can take advantage of the}} solids removal ability of circular tanks and can be managed as either a partial reuse or intensive recirculation system. This study investigated the hydrodynamics of a large-scale (90 m 3) MCR composed of three in-series 5. 5 m× 5. 5 m mixed-cells (∼ 1 m water depth). Water velocity measurements of the entire tank were used to generate velocity-magnitude contours and vector plots, investigate the distribution of water velocities, and evaluate the self-cleaning characteristics and related management issues of an MCR. The grand mean of the water velocities of the three MCR in-series cells was 16. 5 cm/s (16. 1, 15. 5, and 17. 8 cm/s for cell 1, cell 2, and cell 3, respectively). Results showed that water velocities decreased somewhat in a linear manner from the tank bottom to the top, i. e., 18. 9, 15. 8 and 14. 7 cm/s, and in the same way from the periphery (21. 9 cm/s) to the center of the cells (3. 7 cm/s). Analyses indicated that these water velocities were in the optimum range to promote fish health and condition as well as to achieve tank self-cleaning. For a water exchange rate of 1. 7 volumes per hour and an operating head of 1. 36 m in the jet port manifolds, the power requirements of the MCR reached 8. 9 W/m 3. Contour and vector velocity plots showed that the mixed-cells develop a well-defined rotational pattern around the center drain. Also, strategically located water jets directed across the width of the MCR were able to limit the rotational flow to each cell and create the required counter-rotational pattern between adjacent cells. Velocity vectors showed a relatively low turbulence in the corners of the cells, even in the middle cell (cell 2) that had solid-walls on only two sides. Velocity vectors and contour plots also suggested an absence of <b>dead</b> volumes or <b>short-circuiting</b> within the cells, indicating that adequate mixing was being attained in the MCR...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{monitoring}} of the spatio-temporal distribution of process parameters in large-scale vessels and containers such as stirred chemical or bioreactors offers a high potential for the investigation and further optimization of plants and embedded processes. This applies especially to large-scale fermentation biogas reactors where the process performance including the biological processes highly depend on mixing parameters of the complex bio-substrates. Sufficient mixing is a basic requirement for a stable operation {{of the process and}} adequate process performance. However, this condition is rarely met in agricultural biogas plants and the process efficiency is often reduced dramatically by inhomogeneities in the agitated vessels. Without a doupt, investigation and {{monitoring of}} biochemical parameters, such as the fermentation rate, pH distribution as well as O 2 and CO 2 concentration is of great importance. Nevertheless, also understanding of non-biological parameters, such as fluid dynamics (flow velocity profiles, circulation times), suspension mixing (homogeneity, location of <b>dead</b> zones and <b>short-circuits)</b> and heat transfer (temperature profiles), is necessary to analyze the impact of mixing on the biological system and also to improve the process efficiency. However, in most industrial scale applications the acquisition of these parameters and their spatial distributions in the large-scale vessels is hampered by the limited access to the process itself, because sensor mounting or cable connections are not feasible or desired. Therefore, state of the art instrumentation of such reactors is commonly limited to few spatial positions where it is doubtfully assumed that the measured parameters are representative for the whole reaction mixture. In this work, a concept of flow following sensor particles was developed. The sensor particles allow long-term measurement of spatially distributed process parameters in the chemically and mechanically harsh environments of agitated industrial vessels. Each sensor particle comprises of an onboard measurement electronics that logs the signals of measurement devices, namely temperature, absolute pressure (immersion depth, axial position) and 3 D acceleration. The whole electronics is enclosed in a robust neutrally buoyant capsule (equivalent diameter 58. 2 mm; sphericity 0. 91), to allow free movement with the flow. The sensor particles were tested in pilot fermenters under comparable flow conditions of biogas fermenters. The experiments proved the applicability of the sensor particles and the robustness to resist the harsh environments of mixing processes. Moreover, the results show the capabilities of the sensor particles to monitor the internal conditions of the vessel correctly and thus deliver significant information about the flow regime. Therefore effects of liquid rheology, vessel geometry, impeller speed and axial impeller position on the macro-mixing process were properly detected. Evaluation of the impeller efficiency and the mixing processes was done based on mixing homogeneity, location of dead zones, axial velocity profiles, circulation time distributions as well as average circulation times, acceleration spectra and temperature profiles that were extracted from the measured data. Furthermore, it is shown, that parameters of mixing models such as circulation number, impeller head, PECLÉT-number and variance of suspended solid particles can be estimated from the measured data. The main achievement of this work is therefore the development and validation of instrumented flow followers for the investigation of macro-mixing effects in agitated vessels. The sensor particles show potential for employment to real applications such as biogas fermenters or large bioreactors and to monitor and improve the mixing and heating regimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{stormwater}} {{retention pond}} is a best management practice {{used for the}} improvement of runoff water quality before it discharges into larger surface waterbodies. A vortex-type retention pond, called the Nautilus PondTM, is a new design approach for stormwater retention ponds that is expected to produce an internal flow pattern in the pond that is more conducive to removal of sediments from runoff. Since many existing stormwater retention ponds were originally designed only for flood control, most of the ponds are subject to large <b>dead</b> zones, severe <b>short-circuiting</b> and short retention times, which can limit sediment retention in the ponds. In this study, the robustness of the design of the Nautilus PondTM was evaluated by assessing its residence time distribution (RTD) characteristics, flow pattern and sediment deposition patterns under various conditions of flow in the pond. The study was carried out in two physical scale models of a simplified Nautilus PondTM: one with a scale ratio of 1 : 30. 775 for an aspect ratio of 100 : 2, and the other with a scale ratio of 1 : 13. 289 for a pond of 50 : 2 aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the pond diameter at its water surface (top width) to the depth of flow, 2 m at corresponding design flow rates, in the pond. First, the RTD characteristics and flow patterns in the ponds were investigated using tracer mass recovery and flow visualization tests allowing different times for steady flow development (flow development time) for the design flows corresponding to 4 m 3 /s in the 100 : 2 prototype pond and 1 m 3 /s in the 50 : 2 pond. Then, tracer tests were carried out at different flow rates to investigate its effects on the RTD characteristics in both model ponds. The deposition patterns of approximately 50 micron sediment particles (prototype size) were also observed. The best position of a berm around the pond outlet was determined for the 100 : 2 pond by comparing the RTD characteristics and the sediment deposition patterns in the pond for three different positions of the berm. The residence time distribution characteristics and the sediment deposition pattern were also assessed for the 50 : 2 pond with a berm placed in a position equivalent to the best position identified in the 100 : 2 pond tests. It was found that the RTD curves at design flow rates of 4 m 3 /s and 1 m 3 /s for different flow development times were very similar to each other for both pond aspect ratios; the flow development time was found to have little effect on the flow characteristics of the ponds. The average baffle factors, short-circuiting indices and Morril dispersion indices were 0. 41, 0. 20 and 4. 1, respectively, for the 100 : 2 pond aspect ratio, whereas these were 0. 23, 0. 05 and 8. 6 for the 50 : 2 pond. The flow rate was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the RTD characteristics of both ponds. There were multiple peaks in the RTD curves for the lower flow rates tested for the 100 : 2 pond. This was thought to be a result of the low inflow momentum and high aspect ratio of the pond. As the flow rate was increased, the residence time distribution curve had a single, lower peak. In both ponds, an increase of flow rate caused the baffle factor and short-circuiting index to decrease and the Morril dispersion index to increase indicating that the inflow spent a shorter time in the pond. The sediment deposition pattern tests in both ponds without the berm around the outlet showed that a higher quantity of sediments deposited in the outer peripheral region of 100 : 2 pond. The 50 : 2 pond deposited a small amount of sediment along the periphery due to the high velocity inflow jet and lower aspect ratio of the pond. The best position of the berm among those tested was found to be at the 60 % of pond bed radius from the center. Though the RTD characteristics for the 100 : 2 pond with different berm positions were very similar to each other, the 100 : 2 pond with the berm position at 60 % of pond bed radius deposited most of the sediments outside the berm. The RTD characteristics in both ponds showed significant improvement with a berm at the 60 % of radius position compared to the ponds without a berm. This improvement was more significant for the 50 : 2 pond than for the 100 : 2 pond. Further, the sediment deposition pattern in 100 : 2 pond with berm at 60 % of bed radius showed that the larger sized sediment particles mainly deposited outside the berm and the finer particles deposited inside the berm. The 50 : 2 pond did not show any significant difference in particle size distribution of the sediments deposited inside and outside of the berm...|$|R
