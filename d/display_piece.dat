500|$|The soprano aria is a prayer, [...] "" [...] (Consider us with Your love)‘’ (‘Think of us {{with your}} love’) for [...] "God’s future providence", {{described}} by Hofmann as [...] "a musical <b>display</b> <b>piece</b> full of warmth and tenderness in a rocking siciliano rhythm. For long stretches in the vocal sections, Bach does without a continuo accompaniment (thus without the instrumental bass register) – a tactic that effectively contributes to creating a sonic impression of tenderness and charm".|$|E
500|$|Ravel's four chamber works {{composed}} {{after the}} First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the [...] "Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré" [...] for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) {{and finally the}} Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso <b>display</b> <b>piece</b> for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi. The Violin and Cello Sonata is {{a departure from the}} rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody. His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work. Ravel said that the violin and piano are [...] "essentially incompatible" [...] instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility. Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas [...] "rather laboured and unsatisfactory", and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works.|$|E

2500|$|The opera {{has been}} given {{in a variety of}} European and North American {{locations}} in recent times, which begin to increasingly establish it as part of the standard repertoire. [...] A production which was noted as [...] "no longer a <b>display</b> <b>piece</b> for rival divas, nor does it maintain the simplistic view that the opera presents Mary as noble victim and Elizabeth as vengeful monster [...] here, the rival queens are both profoundly tragic, complex figures", was given by English Touring Opera in 2005 and Maria Stuarda was presented at both the Teater Vanemuine in Estonia and Pacific Opera in Victoria, B.C. during the 2011/12 season. Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013, the opera has seen 86 performances of 18 productions in 16 cities, according to Operabase.|$|E
2500|$|Of the concertante works, the Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and {{orchestra}} {{was inspired by}} Mozart and shows Tchaikovsky's affinity for Classical style in its tastefulness and refined poise. The Concert Fantasia for piano {{and orchestra}} is related in its light tone and unorthodox formal structure to the orchestral suites. (The second movement, [...] "Contrastes", had in fact originally been intended as the opening movement of the Third Suite.) Written as a <b>display</b> <b>piece</b> for the soloist, it hearkens {{back to a time}} when audiences concentrated more on the virtuosity of the performer than on the musical content of the piece being played. The Andante and Finale for piano and orchestra was completed and orchestrated posthumously by Sergei Taneyev. It was originally the second and fourth movements of the E-flat symphony, the same source as the Third Piano Concerto.|$|E
2500|$|Friedemann was {{appointed}} in 1733 {{to the position}} of organist of the St. Sophia's Church at Dresden. In competing for the post he played a new version of his father’s Prelude and Fugue in G Major, BWV 541. The judge described Friedemann as clearly superior to the other two candidates. He remained a renowned organist throughout his life. Among his many pupils in Dresden was Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, the keyboardist whose name is erroneously enshrined in the popular nickname given to J. S. Bach's 1742 publication, [...] "Aria with Diverse Variations"—that is, [...] "The Goldberg Variations." [...] The scholar Peter Williams has discredited the story which links the work to Goldberg stating that J. S. Bach wrote the work for the Russian Ambassador Count Hermann Carl von Keyserlingk, who would ask his employee, Goldberg, to play variations for him to ward off insomnia. Williams instead has argued that J.S. Bach wrote the variations to provide a <b>display</b> <b>piece</b> for Friedemann.|$|E
