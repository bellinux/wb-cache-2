5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer <b>has</b> <b>that</b> influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured {{on the cover of}} the issue.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it <b>has</b> <b>that</b> modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E

5|$|The Prime Minister of Canada is an {{official}} {{who serves as}} the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have {{the confidence of the}} elected House of Commons. Normally, this {{is the leader of the}} party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who <b>has</b> <b>that</b> support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.|$|E

Recall {{that in the}} beginning we <b>have</b> proved <b>that</b> H 1 ≈H 0, so we <b>have</b> <b>that</b> H 2 is also computationally indistinguishable from H 0. Combining the above, we obtain that the protocol in Table  3 is resettable non-malleable zero-knowledge.|$|R
25|$|Gottfried Helnwein is my mentor. His {{fight for}} {{expression}} and stance against oppression are reasons why I chose {{him as an}} artistic partner.

25|$|It {{could be}} argued (as, for example, Justice Breyer <b>has)</b> <b>that</b> constitutions are meant to endure over time, {{and in order to}} do so, their {{interpretation}} must therefore be more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances than the amendment process.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} matter {{has changed in}} {{response}} to new scientific discoveries. Thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based.

25|$|The {{history of}} phycology {{is the history}} of the {{scientific}} study of algae.

25|$|The {{position}} of sheriff is {{established by the}} Virginia Constitution, with the sheriff and his deputies having both civil and concurrent criminal jurisdiction countywide. Sheriffs terms are {{for four years and}} are not term limited. Unlike other states, the Sheriff is not necessarily the chief law enforcement officer; in a city that has a police department, a Chief of Police <b>has</b> <b>that</b> distinction according to statute. However, a sheriff is chief law enforcement officer in any county. In such areas, the Chief of Police is the highest-ranking officer, such as in incorporated towns or cities.|$|E
25|$|Sunni {{tradition}} <b>has</b> <b>that</b> {{the next}} day, in the Hijri year 23, whilst Umar {{had just begun}} leading the Fajr (dawn) prayer in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Pirouz had hidden the dagger in his robe, the grip of {{which was in the}} middle, and hid himself {{in a corner of the}} mosque. Shortly after Umar had begun the prayer, Pirūz leapt upon him and stabbed him six times (only three times, according to Ibn Sa'd), this was five times in the stomach and once in the navel, which proved fatal days later. After attacking Umar, Nahavandi stabbed more people, who were trying to subdue him, killing six or nine of them as he tried to flee. When cornered, Nahavandi committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he <b>has</b> <b>that</b> encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
