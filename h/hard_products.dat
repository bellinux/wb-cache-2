40|$|AbstractThe {{global markets}} are {{embroidered}} by profound complexity woven by the persistent worldwide economic recession, the EURO crisis and shift of economic powers {{as well as}} escalating competition among traditional and emerging suppliers of <b>hard</b> <b>products.</b> Many companies with <b>hard</b> <b>products</b> are facing their eroding competitiveness as they base their corporate value on excellent, yet locked-in hard capabilities. Especially, the Japanese leading electronics companies have reported shaky business performances in business year 2011 while other Japanese companies with systems products are performing well over the Japanese industry average. Against these rugged performances of the Japanese companies, a natural question arises as to what makes such a difference now among those in the same manufacturing industry {{which used to be}} generally performing well in a line; whether an enterprise viability system problem exists with the troubled companies; and what are solutions that project and program management can contribute to in the complex market environment as now. This paper configures a resilient enterprise system model in the Japanese “monodukuri” industry, or, the industry of manufacturing and systems environment integration, which would enable companies to consistently cope with changing environment and produce corporate value out of ecosystem adaptation and systems integration capabilities on the foundation of meta program management...|$|E

Product property hardness depending on geological origin of the raw material was compared in two groups, soft and hard. Crystalline dolomites e. g. were regarded as <b>hard</b> <b>products</b> and sedimentary lime-stones as soft ones. Also particle size and particle size distribution in the products were compared. Two classes were used, fine graded (< 1 mm) and coarse graded (< 3 mm), respectively. All material used was ordinary commercial products. Twelve experiments were run for 8 years.

40|$|In {{an eight-year}} {{investigation}} lime-products were compared. Field experiments were started on 16 sites distributed {{from north to}} south in Sweden. Product property hardness depending on geological origin of the raw material was compared in two groups, soft and hard. Also particle size and particle size distribution in the products were studied. Two classes were used, fine graded (< 1 mm) and coarse graded (< 3 mm) material, respectively. Ordinary commercial products were used. The experimental plan was designed to give treatments with a predetermined base saturation (BS). The obtained BS values were compared in the groups hard/soft and fine/coarse, respectively. Treatments showing effects of dosage of lime over time were also included. Tested factors i. e. hard/soft and fine/coarse increased BS clearly and decisively. Soft products resulted in higher BS than <b>hard</b> <b>products</b> and fine graded products increased BS more than coarse graded ones. Similar results were observed for pH-values as well. Reactive soluble Al determined with ammonium-sulphate ex-traction correlated well with the lime applications. Liming lowered these Al-values. The effect on BS was the highest the 2 nd year after lime application. Later the effect declined. Eight years after lime application treatments with consecutive minor rates the first 4 years were superior concerning BS to treatments with full rate the first year and then nothing. On average for the last 4 years over the 8 -year period the split application treatment resulted in higher BS than the single rate treatment. A five to seven percent yield increase in cereals in limed treatments was ob-served. The higher figure was valid for spring cereals. The yield increase was measured as a mean for the first 4 years.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of science and}} technology in South Africa in the next decade has been emphasised in the National R&D strategy, and a target expenditure of one per cent of GDP on R&D has been set. Research programmes in transport in the 1990 s did not yield the expected outcomes and impact due to severe fragmentation of the programmes and subsequent diminished funding and output. Road authorities and the private sector expressed a need for the improvement of the associated management processes. International work in technology management has focused mainly on linear models of managing the development of <b>hard</b> <b>products</b> for the consumer market. These models are not suitable for the road building industry where the majority of the R&D programmes are aimed at the development of new knowledge, engineering methodology and associated engineering solutions. In addition, the R&D process is complex with many elements and interactions, and thus a simple linear management model is unlikely to yield the desired results. This thesis is aimed at the development of a systems-based R&D management model and tools for road engineering and shows that their implementation has a significant impact on R&D outputs. This study evaluated international best practice as well as the success and failure factors of six local R&D programmes. A developmental research approach was used to identify the problem, develop a solution and test the solution in a number of R&D programmes. The model is based on a systems approach, taking aspects of cybernetics and complexity theory into consideration and is radically different from the linear approaches usually followed in the management of the development of consumer products. A set of analysis tools supporting the strategic model was developed. These include a strategic needs determination process, the technology tree tool and a research effectiveness measurement system. The new conceptual model and the associated analysis tools were implemented in four significant research programmes in the public sector, private sector and research organisations. The emphasis was on managing the synergy between the programmes in a holistic approach, thus enhancing the outcome and impact of the programmes. It is shown that the implementation of the models and tools had a significant effect on the R&D output from these research programmes. Finally, two protocols {{for the use of the}} model and tools were developed and their use in the Labour-Intensive Construction field demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|For {{a longer}} period of time, {{manufacturing}} was the core business activity and hence service has gained lesser attention. However, a time came when manufacturers faced a huge challenge to stay profitable which apparently gave service to get more attention. The reason to this can be classified in to three categories: economic reasons, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage (Oliva et al., 2003). Understanding this, Volvo Group has set high target for revenues from soft products including service. In order to achieve this it is necessary to expand existing service offerings and explore more new service offerings. As part of this goal, Volvo Technology has been working on several projects. One of the projects which are closely related to this thesis is the Hauler Development Service (HDS) which started in 2008 for the trucking (Hauling) industry. HDS has two versions; HDS Green Field and HDS Efficiency and Effectiveness. HDS Green field focuses on starting up new road transport operations and establish business processes including system support on emerging markets. HDS Efficiency and Effectiveness focuses on performing assessments and improvement programs on already established firms on mature markets. These business offerings started to get their orders from customers and thus proving their functionality. However, unlike the trucking industry, the construction equipment business area within Volvo Group is lacking such business offerings today. Volvo Construction Equipment is the second largest business area within the Volvo group generating about 16 % of the total sales. Volvo CE is mostly offering <b>hard</b> <b>products</b> and wants to expand its service offerings and assume a better position as a professional service solution provider. The development of HDS for the trucking industry and the need for Volvo CE to expand its service offerings laid the background for this thesis. One of the market segments Volvo CE provides equipments is to the quarry and aggregate business segment. Customers with in this business area were successfully contacted and collaborated in this study. This master thesis investigated what the customers in the quarry and aggregate business area needs and problems are and developed a service concept which Volvo CE can offer {{while at the same time}} solving customer problems. This service concept was found out to be Energy Efficiency Improvement Service intended to help lower production costs of the customer by eliminating or lowering energy wastes and improve environmental impacts by lowering carbon emissions. Moreover, customer energy performance measures were studied and analysed if they are robust enough to be used as measures to the improvements inevitable by the new service offer, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Service. Results show that the energy performance measures currently in use are not robust enough, and suggest further development of energy performance measure system. In order to realize the service offer in a practical manner, the five lean principles (define value, identify value stream, floe, pull and continuous improvement) were tested if they can be used as tools to identify and measure energy wastes at the customers operation site and proved to be useful...|$|E
