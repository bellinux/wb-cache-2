40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the worm disease on goats and sheep kept on Panicum maximum Jacq. pastures, in the rainy season of the year. The dry matter density (DM) of different layers (0 - 15, 15 - 30 and above 30 cm) of Panicum maximum Jacq. pastures, and the <b>forage</b> <b>contamination</b> by gastrintestinal nematode infective larvae (L 3) were quantified. Forty animals were submitted monthly to coproparasitological examinations (ECG and coproculture) during the rainy season. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Barreiras-Bahia-Brazil, in a split-plot design, with 10 replications on pastures and 20 replications on animals, from October of 2003 to March of 2004, and samples were taken from December to February. The number of infective larvae per kg/DM did not change with the grass layer, with average of 22. 2 L 3 /kg DM. On the forage, Haemonchus sp. and Trichostrongylus sp. L 3 larvae were indentified, reflecting the coproculture results. Goats showed higher ECG counting (2602) than Sheep (865), demanding more sanitary care...|$|E
40|$|Ruminant diets include cereals, protein feeds, their {{by-products}} {{as well as}} hay and grass, grass/legume, whole-crop maize, {{small grain}} or sorghum silages. Furthermore, ruminants are annually or seasonally fed with grazed forage {{in many parts of}} the World. All these forages could be contaminated by several exometabolites of mycotoxigenic fungi that increase and diversify the risk of mycotoxin exposure in ruminants compared to swine and poultry that have less varied diets. Evidence suggests the greatest exposure for ruminants to some regulated mycotoxins (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, ochratoxin A, fumonisins and zearalenone) and to many other secondary metabolites produced by different species of Alternaria spp. (e. g., AAL toxins, alternariols, tenuazonic acid or 4 Z-infectopyrone), Aspergillus flavus (e. g., kojic acid, cyclopiazonic acid or beta-nitropropionic acid), Aspergillus fuminatus (e. g., gliotoxin, agroclavine, festuclavines or fumagillin), Penicillium roqueforti and P. paneum (e. g., mycophenolic acid, roquefortines, PR toxin or marcfortines) or Monascus ruber (citrinin and monacolins) could be mainly related to <b>forage</b> <b>contamination.</b> This review includes the knowledge of mycotoxin occurrence reported in the last 15 years, with special emphasis on mycotoxins detected in forages, and animal toxicological issues due to their ingestion. Strategies for preventing the problem of mycotoxin feed contamination under farm conditions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{member of}} the Aster family, Canada thistle is a vigorous, highly {{competitive}} species. Occurring in a large range of habitats including croplands, ditch banks and riparian areas, gardens and pastures, this category 1 noxious perennial weed is particularly hard to control because of its deep, creeping, reproductive root system forming colonies. In general, infestations start on disturbed ground, with plants being able to colonize 10 to 12 feet per year. Canada thistle can grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, but it is best adapted to deep, well-aerated and productive soils. It prefers sunny and warm areas with 15 to 30 or more inches of precipitation or irrigation per year, but it can grow on dryer cropland and pasture sites with 12 to 13 inches of precipitation per year. When temperatures exceed 85 ยบ F for extended periods of time, it stops growing. Canada thistle threatens productivity in both crop and non-croplands. In cropland, Canada thistle causes extensive yield losses through competition for light, nutrients, and moisture. It also increases harvesting problems due to seed and <b>forage</b> <b>contamination.</b> In Montana, it is estimated that two shoots per square yard can reduce wheat yield by 15 percent and 25 shoots per square yard can reduce wheat yield by 60 percent. Other Montana crops seriously threatened by Canada thistl...|$|E
