Given an initial vector x(1), annual dynamics were described by x(25) =B(24) [...] . B(1) x(1) =Ax(1), where A was the annual projection matrix. A steady-state hypothesis was used to estimate offtake gains and financial returns from a trial of pasteurellosis vaccination and anthelminthic drench in traditionally managed sheep flocks in Senegal, from July 1987 to June 1988.

In the trial, vaccination had a negative effect on offtakes among females. No vaccination effect was observed for males. A positive effect of deworming was found for both sexes. From the trial data, our model calculated that the overall ratio of offtakes (i. e. number of animals) for dewormed over undrenched sheep was 1. 2 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 1, 1. 4).

In a prior <b>experiment</b> in <b>village</b> India, {{we found that}} low caste children respond to incentives {{in the same way}} as their high caste counterparts when their caste identity is not mentioned, but do much worse when their caste status is made salient. To examine a mechanism for our result, we designed a new experiment that manipulates the scope for discretion in rewarding performance. When asked to accept or reject a (more than fair) gamble in which there is no scope for judgment by an experimenter, making caste salient does not produce a caste gap. Instead, it is in the case where there is scope for discretion that caste has an effect. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that making caste salient cues individuals at the bottom of the cultural hierarchy to expect prejudicial treatment, which undermines their motivation and contributes to the persistence of group inequality...|$|R

Using village and household survey {{data collected from}} 48 villages of 8 Chinese provinces for the period 1986 - 2002, this paper studies how the introduction of elections affects village governance and income distribution in Chinese villages. The econometric analysis finds the following outcomes. First, village elections have increased the share of public expenditure and reduced the share of administrative expenditure in the village budget, so the accountability of the elected village committee has been enhanced. Second, elections have not led to more income redistribution; instead, they have reduced the progressiveness of income redistribution. Third, elections have reduced income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient in villages. The reduction is equivalent to 5. 7 {{percent of the sample}} average, or 32 percent of the growth of the Gini coefficient in the period of 1987 - 2002. Because village elections have not led to more income redistribution, this positive effect must have come from more public investment, which benefits the poor more than wealthier people. The general conclusion that we draw from our results is that, despite institutional constraints, village elections have improved village governance and the life of villagers.

Its goals were to: (1) describe the patterns of mortality of female Guinean goats by age, season and year; (2) assess preventive measures against respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal parasitism in reducing mortality; and (3) estimate the overall impact of these measures on survival to 1 year of age. Preventive measures for respiratory disease included vaccination against peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and pneumonic pasteurellosis (Pasteurella multocida types A and D). Control of gastrointestinal parasites was by deworming does with morantel (7. 5 mg kg- 1, three times during the rainy season). The effects of vaccines and deworming were tested in a randomised factorial field <b>experiment</b> with <b>villages</b> being the experimental units. A total of 19 villages, 113 goat herds and 1458 goats were included in the study. Generalised linear models of survival for five cohorts of goats (defined by five different birth seasons) used a binomial assumption for the response distribution and a complementary logâ€“log link. Explanatory variables included age, season, year, vaccination, deworming and their interactions. A complex a priori model was built on the basis of previous epidemiological knowledge; a purposively selected set of simpler models was compared to this full model by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and derived statistics. Inference on 1 -year survival and treatment effects accounted for model-selection uncertainty. It was carried out with a bootstrap procedure and used information from the whole set of selected models. Large variations in mortality by year and season were observed but no regular seasonal pattern was apparent. Mortality probabilities of kids in dewormed groups decreased quickly after birth, but remained elevated up to 9 months of age in the non-dewormed groups. Deworming lowered the risk of mortality.

Although {{there is little doubt that}} the Southwest's large villages and small towns were committed to successful farming, methodological and conceptual problems have impeded archaeological analyses of the ecological and evolutionary implications of this revolutionary shift in how people related to the world and to one another. The rapid and radical change that occurred in the Transition Zone's Grasshopper Region during the late AD 1200 s and early 1300 s provides a high resolution glimpse at the processes and products of agricultural commitment [...] notably increasing reliance on farming and the development of permanent towns and institutionalized systems for resource and conflict management.

40|$|Information about insurgent {{groups is}} a central {{resource}} in civil wars: counterinsurgents seek it, insurgents safeguard it, and civilians often trade it. Yet despite its essential role in civil war dynamics, the act of informing is still poorly understood, due mostly to the classified nature of informant “tips. ” As an alternative research strategy, we use an original 2, 700 respondent survey <b>experiment</b> in 100 <b>villages</b> to examine attitudes toward the Guardians of Peace program, a widespread campaign by the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan to recruit local infor-mants. We find that coethnic bias—the systematic tendency to favor cooperation with coethnics—shapes attitudes about informing and beliefs about retaliation, especially among Tajik respondents. This bias persists even after ad-justing for additional explanations and potential confounding variables, suggesting that identity considerations such as coethnicity may influence attitudes toward high-risk behavior in wartime settings. W hat explains the willingness of individuals to in-form on insurgents during civil wars? To date,our theories of civil war violence have empha-sized the potential role of civilians as sources of information about insurgent identities and activities. Indeed, a basic pre-cept of counterinsurgency warfare is that state authorities and external interveners struggle to correctly identify insur-gents who blend within the broader populace (Kalyvas 2006, 179; 2012; Leites and Wolf 1970; Lyall and Wilson 2009). Yet despite {{the central role of}} wartime informing, we still lack an individual-level empirical investigation into the dif-ferent motives that might drive civilians to consider engag-ing in such risky wartime behavior. At first glance, it appears likely that identity considera-tions such as shared ethnicity would influence wartime deci-sion making. Scholars have often used ethnicity to explain civil war onset (Cederman, Wimmer, and Min 2010; Horo...|$|R

Benth, and natural bush fallows were assessed in three villages in southern Cameroon. In each <b>village,</b> <b>experiments</b> {{were set up}} in a 4 – 5 year-old bush fallow dominated by Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King and H. Rob and a more than 20 year-old secondary forest. Total aboveground biomass production of P. phaseoloides was 7. 45 Mg ha− 1, 4. 2 times higher than F. macrophylla (1. 78 Mg ha− 1; P < 0. 05). In two years (24 MAP), the soil bulk density under P. phaseoloides, F. macrophylla and the natural regrowth in both bush and forest land use systems decreased (P < 0. 05). Within the same period, there was a general improvement in aggregate stability. The particle size distribution changed over 3 years (36 MAP), such that at 0 – 10 cm depth, the percent sand content had reduced whiles the percent clay content had increased under all the fallow systems in both bush and forest land use systems (LUSs). Soil N also increased significantly (P < 0. 05) after cropping under all the fallow systems in both LUS. In contrast, soil organic carbon decreased, but the extent was lower under P. phaseoloides and F. macrophylla compared to the natural regrowth. Soil P also decreased after cropping under all the fallow systems in both LUS whereas decrease in Mg was only observed under P. phaseoloides. F. macrophylla had Mg content after cropping similar to the initial in both LUS. Soil contents of K and Ca were not significantly different over time under all the fallow systems. Comparing the initial Helicotylenchus multicinctus population to that at 12 MAP, both P. phaseoloides and F. macrophylla reduced density of H. multicinctus (P < 0. 05). However, when the initial population density was compared to that at 24 MAP only under P. phaseoloides was the reduction maintained. The study concluded that the general improvement in the soil physical properties, impacted positively on the N and organic carbon contents which were sustained to a larger extent under the planted fallows than the natural regrowth. Furthermore, P. phaseoloides could be used as one component for the biological control of Helicotylenchus multicinctus, a phytopathogenic nematode. Peer Revie...|$|R
