25|$|Providing {{the relay}} is free from dirt, the metal disc and the spindle with its contact {{will reach the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>contact,</b> thus sending a signal to trip and isolate the circuit, within its {{designed}} time and current specifications. Drop off current of the relay is much lower than its operating value, and once reached the relay will be reset in a reverse motion by {{the pressure of the}} control spring governed by the braking magnet.|$|E
25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E

50|$|Battery {{contacts}} are {{the most}} important part of the design and require serious consideration. Since batteries are nickel-plated, it is recommended the contacts be nickel-plated to prevent galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals.

50|$|Slightly more {{complicated}} was the two axis stepping switch, (also called Strowger switch or two motion selector in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect {{to one of}} 100 (or 200) different <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts,</b> in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts.</b> The wipers moved {{up and down on}} a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the wipers to their home position at the bottom.|$|R

50|$|When current {{passes through}} the electromagnet, a {{magnetic}} field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The electromagnet coil draws more current initially, until its inductance increases when the metal core enters the coil. The moving contact is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the electromagnet holds the moving and <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts</b> together. When the contactor coil is de-energized, gravity or a spring returns the electromagnet core to its initial position and opens the contacts.|$|R
50|$|A wire spring relay {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each contact {{is either a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>contact,</b> which does not move, or is a moving contact, and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the wire spring relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed contacts. A normally open (make) contact, a normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> A moving contact consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|E
50|$|Power supply studs are the <b>fixed</b> <b>contact</b> {{elements}} of a stud/skate or stud/ski collector electrical connection system. They are used when a moving element {{needs to be in}} electrical contact with a static element. The main advantage of the system is the self-cleaning facility of the skate/ski with the stud.|$|E
50|$|Knife {{switches}} {{consist of}} a flat metal blade, hinged at one end, with an insulating handle for operation, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> When the switch is closed, current flows through the hinged pivot and blade and through the <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> Such switches are usually not enclosed. The knife and contacts are typically formed of copper, steel, or brass, depending on the application. Fixed contacts may be backed up with a spring. Several parallel blades can be operated {{at the same time}} by one handle. The parts may be mounted on an insulating base with terminals for wiring, or may be directly bolted to an insulated switch board in a large assembly. Since the electrical contacts are exposed, the switch is used only where people cannot accidentally come in contact with the switch or where the voltage is so low as to not present a hazard.|$|E
5000|$|In most applications, such as telephony, it is {{desirable}} {{to be able to}} return the wipers to a [...] "home" [...] position; this is at the beginning of rotation, {{at one end of the}} array of <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts.</b> Some switches have a cam attached to the wiper shaft. This cam operates a set of contacts when the wiper is at home position, which is at the beginning of the span of rotation. Other circuit designs used one level (pole) of the contacts to home the wipers, so the separate homing contacts were not needed.|$|R

50|$|Fixed {{contacts}} are inexpensive but {{prone to}} loss of electrical connection. Combination of fixed and flexible contacts are a better solution, {{but this is}} subject to an open circuit upon movement in the direction away from the fixed position; the spring contact compresses and allows the battery {{to move away from}} the <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> A flexible contact allows for slight expansion of the cell on discharge, as internal chemicals increase in volume. Flexible contacts with multiple fingers touching the anode and cathode allow for movement in multiple directions without losing electrical connection.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new method {{to study the}} capability of an underactuated hand to produce form-closed grasps. First, the stability behaviours of different underactuated parallel-jaw grippers are analyzed and compared according to their actuation and transmission mechanisms. Then, both notions of 1 st order and 2 nd order form-closure are revisited for underactuated hands, since {{in this particular case}} the assumption of <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts</b> made in the original definition is false. Therefore, constraints imposed by non-backdrivable mechanisms are introduced into the model of the whole grasp. Finally, a simple geometrical condition, necessary and sufficient for 1 st order form-closure is proposed. This permits to conclude on the minimum number of non-backdrivable mechanisms required to produce 1 st order form-closed grasps using an underactuated hand...|$|R
50|$|Traction {{equipment}} {{is concentrated in}} the middle car. Designing the car body to {{be strong enough to}} support transformer and air conditioning equipment on the roof whilst limiting the weight proved difficult, delaying delivery by about a year.Each end car has a driving positions and a pantograph. To allow lateral movement each pantograph is mounted on a sledge. At standstill the sledge can be moved by 1.3 m from the centre to the side. Contacts on the sledge engage with <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts</b> on the car roof to route the current to either the AC (centre position) or DC equipment. The pneumatic cylinder allows movement to the right only, but, should the EMU be turned, provision can be made for movement to the other side with a simple intervention at the workshop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{commutator}} {{is needed}} to produce direct current. When a loop of wire rotates in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it, and thus the potential induced in it, reverses with each half turn, generating an alternating current. However, {{in the early days}} of electric experimentation, alternating current generally had no known use. The few uses for electricity, such as electroplating, used direct current provided by messy liquid batteries. Dynamos were invented as a replacement for batteries. The commutator is essentially a rotary switch. It consists of a set of contacts mounted on the machine's shaft, combined with graphite-block stationary contacts, called [...] "brushes", because the earliest such <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts</b> were metal brushes. The commutator reverses the connection of the windings to the external circuit when the potential reverses, so instead of alternating current, a pulsing direct current is produced.|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} variations exist, but {{in general}} a vacuum interrupter will have a <b>fixed</b> <b>contact,</b> a moving contact, a flexible bellows to allow movement of the moving contact, and arc shields, enclosed in a hermetic glass, ceramic or metal housing that is evacuated to a high vacuum. The moving contact is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by an actuating mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the inherent closing force of air pressure on the bellows.|$|E
50|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E
50|$|When an {{electric}} current is {{passed through the}} coil it generates a magnetic field that activates the armature, and the consequent movement of the movable contact(s) either makes or breaks (depending upon construction) a connection with a <b>fixed</b> <b>contact.</b> If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de-energized, then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection, and vice versa if the contacts were open. When the current to the coil is switched off, the armature is returned by a force, approximately half {{as strong as the}} magnetic force, to its relaxed position. Usually this force is provided by a spring, but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor starters. Most relays are manufactured to operate quickly. In a low-voltage application this reduces noise; in a high voltage or current application it reduces arcing.|$|E

40|$|Granular {{packings}} of hard discs are {{investigated by}} means of contact dynamics which is an appropriate technique to explore the allowed force-realizations {{in the space of}} contact forces. Configurations are generated for given values of the friction coefficient, and then an ensemble of equilibrium forces is found for <b>fixed</b> <b>contacts.</b> We study the force fluctuations within this ensemble. In the limit of zero friction the fluctuations vanish in accordance with the isostaticity of the packing. The magnitude of the fluctuations has a non-monotonous friction dependence. The increase for small friction {{can be attributed to the}} opening of the angle of the Coulomb cone, while the decrease as friction increases is due to the reduction of connectivity of the contact-network, leading to local, independent clusters of indeterminacy. We discuss the relevance of indeterminacy to packings of deformable particles and to the mechanical response properties. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures. Minor changes, journal reference adde...|$|R
