5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station {{and when the}} response is received. This measure is twice the distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station to satellite to the aircraft and includes {{the time that the}} SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, 1332, a fire {{broke out}} in the palace of the podestà, the leading {{magistrate}} of the city. This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, {{all the way up to}} the roof. On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E

The team in the courtyard was to enter the house <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor.|$|E

5|$|Anderson and Dredd {{obtain the}} code to Ma-Ma's {{apartment}} from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, {{in the case}} of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice the distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes {{the time that the}} SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Cormier {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength and intense exercise regimen. He was known to bench press 450 pounds with each, and he was once recorded as bench pressing 527 pounds.

According to one story, he once got upset with a horse that refused to cooperate and knocked it down with one punch.|$|E

5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
