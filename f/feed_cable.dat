The quarter-wavelength choke are narrow-band and the ferrite beads are lossy at higher frequency greater than 1 GHz.

40|$|In this article, {{the design}} of a ultra-wideband (UWB) {{monopole}} antenna with coplanar-waveguide (CPW) -coupled-fed is presented. The antenna is composed of a trapezium patch with a CPW-fed printed {{on one side of the}} substrate and an elliptical radiator on the other side. By simply cutting slits on the radiation patch, a single, dual, and triple band notched characteristics can be achieved. Parametric studies on the antenna and slits are carried out by computer simulation. Results show that the notch frequencies can be set by using dimensions of the slits. The antennas are designed and optimized using computer simulation. For verification, the antennas with single and dual band-notched characteristics are fabricated and measured. The simulated and measured results on the return loss, radiation pattern, peak gain, and efficiency of the antenna are presented. Due to the small ground-plane size of the antenna, the <b>feeding</b> <b>cable</b> used in the measurement equipment significantly affects the measured results and leads to large discrepancies between the simulated and measured results at low frequencies.

The radiator of the antenna has a compact size of only 14. 5 × 8. 7 mm 2 and consists of a short stem and two branches generating two frequency bands at around 2. 4 and 3. 5 GHz for the WiMAX system. The two frequency bands can be easily and independently set using the parameters of the two radiating branches. The antenna performance in terms of reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, peak gain, and efficiency is studied using computer simulation. For verification of simulation results, the antenna is fabricated and measured using the antenna measurement system Satimo Starlab.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the design of}} a planar ultra-wideband (UWB) monopole antenna with a deep band-notched characteristic. The antenna has an elliptical radiator fed by a microstrip line and a small ground-plane size of 30 × 15 mm 2. Two pairs of meander lines (MLs) are employed to implement the deep band-notched characteristic. One pair of the MLs is placed closely {{on both sides of the}} microstrip-feed line with one of their ends shorted to ground. The other pair is placed at the upper edges of the ground plane on the other side of the substrate. The frequency range of the notched band can be controlled by the dimensions of the MLs. In our studies, the notched band is designed in the frequency band from 5. 1 to 5. 85 GHz to suppress the signals in the WLAN system. The antenna is studied and optimized using computer simulation. For verification of simulation results, the antenna is fabricated and measured. Results show that, by using the two pairs of MLs, the gain of the antenna at the notch frequency can be suppressed by 14 dB, with the efficiency reduced to less than 5 %. Due to the small ground-plane size used in the antenna, the <b>feeding</b> <b>cable</b> used for measurements in the measurement equipment has significant effects on the measured results. This leads to large discrepancies between the simulated and measured results at low frequencies. To study this, the model of the <b>feeding</b> <b>cable</b> is also included in simulation and the results show that the discrepancies are substantially reduced. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
