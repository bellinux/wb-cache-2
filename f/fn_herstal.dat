5|$|The Australian Defence Force {{seeks to}} be a {{high-technology}} force, {{and much of}} its equipment {{is scheduled to be}} replaced or upgraded in the near future. Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The FN P90, {{also known}} as the FN Project 1990, is a {{personal}} defense weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> in Belgium. Created in response to NATO requests for a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum firearms, the P90 was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups.|$|E
5|$|PS90 Standard: The PS90 Standard is {{the current}} model of the PS90 offered by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal.</b> It {{features}} a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail fitted {{to the top of}} the receiver, which allows the shooter to mount their preferred optical sight. The rail includes a set of integrated iron sights, as backup in case the primary sight is damaged. The PS90 Standard is available with either an olive drab or black frame.|$|E
25|$|The 4.6×30mm {{cartridge}} {{was introduced}} in 1999. It {{was designed as a}} competitor to <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal's</b> 5.7×28mm cartridge.|$|R
50|$|Firearms {{designed}} and/or {{manufactured by}} FN include the Browning Hi-Power and FN Five-seveN pistols, FAL, FNC and F2000 rifles, P90 submachine gun, and M2 Browning, MAG and Minimi machine guns - {{all of which}} have been very successful for the company. <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal's</b> firearms are used by the militaries of over 100 nations.|$|R
5000|$|The FN Minimi (short for Mini Mitrailleuse; [...] "mini machine gun") is a Belgian 5.56mm {{light machine}} gun {{developed}} by Fabrique Nationale (<b>FN)</b> in <b>Herstal</b> by Ernest Vervier. First introduced in the late 1970s, it is now in service in more than 75 countries. The weapon is currently manufactured at the <b>FN</b> facility in <b>Herstal</b> and their US subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC.|$|R
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} {{in response to}} NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. According to the NATO requirement, the new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, {{it was to be}} capable of penetrating body armor. <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> responded to the NATO requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm cartridge and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.|$|E
5|$|The SS195LF is {{a commercially}} {{available}} cartridge {{that features a}} lead-free primer and produces ballistics similar to the SS192 round, which it replaced in late 2004. It uses the same 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet as the SS192, {{and it can be}} identified by the unmarked, hollow void at the tip and the silver-colored primer. The SS195 is classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and it is currently manufactured by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|<b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> was {{the first}} small arms {{manufacturer}} to respond to NATO's requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the P90, along with a small caliber, high velocity 5.7×28mm cartridge type. The original 5.7×28mm cartridge, called the SS90, went into production with the P90 in 1990. The SS90 propelled a 1.5g (23grain) plastic-core projectile from the P90 at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). Shortly after its introduction, the P90 was adopted and used in service with the Belgian special forces group in the 1991 Gulf War.|$|E
50|$|More modern Western grenade {{launchers}} {{address some}} of the shortcomings of the M203, such as the sliding breech limiting the weapon's ability to load outsize projectiles and the lack of factory-fitted sight mounts, with designs like <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal's</b> ELGM and Heckler & Koch's AG36 featuring a swing-out breech to provide better access, integral sight mounts, and built-in support for standalone conversion. A variant of the latter weapon, the M320 Grenade Launcher Module, was salvaged from the failed XM8 program and adopted in 2008 as the US military's replacement for the M203.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the CAR68, Gun f/x was approached by the Monterey Bay Corporation to provide concept and development for a less-lethal projectile launcher for use by military and law enforcement. Working with Airgun Designs, this project produced the concept less-lethal weapon known as the UTPBS, which eventually became <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal's</b> <b>FN</b> 303. This design could be attached to an M16 rifle and was conceived as a less-lethal weapon coupled with a lethal weapon system, providing a wide range of response capabilities that were immediately available. A stand-alone version was also developed. The UTPBS also featured a rotating barrel magazine, allowing {{for a wide range of}} different projectiles to be available and selectable without the need to change magazines. The company is currently working on further development of the burst disc concept, as well as a variety of less-lethal weapons and simulators.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, after {{bankruptcy}} of the employee-organized corporation, USRAC {{was taken over}} by Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN),</b> a Belgium-based international group producing firearms.|$|R
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> specifically {{for use in the}} FN P90 personal defense weapon and FN Five-seven pistol. Subsequently, it has been used {{in a number of other}} weapons, such as the FN PS90 carbine and the AR-57, an upper receiver for M16 and AR-15 rifles. The ST Kinetics CPW can be configured for the 5.7×28mm cartridge by changing the barrel and magazine groups. Excel Arms has developed four firearms chambered in 5.7×28mm, and MasterPiece Arms offers three different 5.7×28mm firearms.|$|E
5|$|The SS197SR is {{currently}} offered to civilian shooters {{in addition to}} the SS195LF. It uses the same lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max projectile as the SS196SR, but it is loaded for a muzzle velocity roughly 30-m/s (100ft/s) higher. The projectile has a blue-colored polymer tip instead of the red color used in the SS196 projectile tip. The SS197 has been manufactured by Fiocchi, under contract for <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal,</b> since 2006 and it is distributed in the United States by Federal Cartridge Company.|$|E
5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5000|$|The Browning Hi Power is a single-action, {{semi-automatic}} handgun {{available in}} 9mm and [...]40 S&W calibers. It {{is based on}} a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by Dieudonné Saive at Fabrique Nationale (<b>FN)</b> of <b>Herstal,</b> Belgium. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. The Hi-Power {{is one of the most}} widely used military pistols in history, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries.|$|R
50|$|The FN Browning M1900 is {{a single}} action, {{semi-automatic}} pistol designed c. 1896 by John Browning for Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN)</b> and produced in Belgium {{at the turn of}} the century. It was the first production handgun to use a slide.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle is {{manufactured}} at the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (owned by <b>FN</b> de <b>Herstal)</b> to <b>FN</b> specifications using Winchester Model 70 actions. All current {{models of}} the SPR come in one {{of a variety of}} McMillan synthetic stocks. The earliest rifles were shipped in the H-S Precision aluminum chassis fiberglass version of the Winchester Marksman stock. While these [...] "First Generation" [...] rifles were simply dropped into the aluminum bedding blocks of the H-S Precision stock, the later guns are all glass bedded by hand.|$|R
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal.</b> This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E
25|$|There are weapons mount options: Fore and aft crew-served weapon mounts, 360 degree turret with roll protection, and {{standard}} swing arm mounts. BCC {{has been working}} with Garwood Industries (GI) to integrate their M134 Minigun, <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> to integrate their light Weapon Stations, and Military Systems Group (MSG) for multiple weapon stations.|$|E
50|$|The FAL {{has been}} used by over 90 countries, and over two million have been produced. The FAL was {{originally}} made by Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN)</b> in Liège, Belgium, but it has also been made under license in fifteen countries. As of August 2006, new examples were still being produced by at least four different manufacturers worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|The other guns tested {{included}} the Beretta M9, the Colt SSP, the Fabrique National at <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN)</b> High Power , FN Fast Action and FN double-action (FN DA) models, the Star Model M28 and the Smith & Wesson 459, Walther P88, and Steyr GB. The existing standard M1911A1 and the Smith & Wesson M15 [...]38 Special handguns were also tested to {{compared to those}} which were submitted for comparison.|$|R
5000|$|Nonivamide is used (under {{the name}} PAVA) as the payload in [...] "less-lethal munitions" [...] {{such as the}} Fabrique Nationale <b>Herstal</b> <b>FN</b> 303 or as the active {{ingredient}} in most pepper sprays - in both applications, {{the idea is to}} temporarily incapacitate people so that they can either be detained prior to arrest or deterred from acts of violence toward law-enforcement personnel or third parties (such as rioting or other group violence).|$|R
25|$|The handgun {{was adopted}} into service with the Austrian {{military}} and police forces in 1982 as the P80 (Pistole 80), with an initial order for 25,000 guns. The Glock 17 outperformed eight different pistols from five other established manufacturers (Heckler & Koch of Germany offered their P7M8, P7M13, and P9S, SIG Sauer of Switzerland bid with their P220 and P226 models, Beretta of Italy submitted their model 92SB-F, <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> proposed an updated variant of the Browning Hi-Power, and the home-grown Steyr Mannlicher entered the competition with the GB).|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid to}} late 1970s, the CM60A1 {{had been}} largely {{superseded}} by the similar Cloche Spéciale (CS) 60 which was distinguished by its ribbed barrel. The CS 60 utilized more ergonomic ammunition, which allowed for up to 56 mortar projectiles to be stored in the HE-60-7 turret, as opposed to the CM60A1's 43. Nevertheless, both mortar types continued to be marketed {{in a wide range of}} commercial turrets for the export market. In the late 1970s, the CM60A1 was successfully mounted on a variant of the Panhard M3 designated M3 VTT 60B. It was also offered for export with the Berliet VXB-170. South Africa later mounted K1 mortars on its fleet of Ratel infantry fighting vehicles, which were designated Ratel-60. A gun-mortar almost identical to the CM60A1 was produced by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> for the FN 4RM/62F AB armoured cars of the Belgian Gendarmerie.|$|E
25|$|Liège {{has also}} been an {{important}} centre for gunsmithing since the Middle ages and the arms industry is still strong with the headquarters of <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal.</b> The economy of the region is now diversified, the most important centers are mechanical industries (aircraft engine and Spacecraft propulsion), space technology, information technology, biotechnology and also production of water, beer or chocolate. Liège Science Park south east of the city, near the University of Liège campus, houses spin-offs and high technology businesses. Liège {{is also a very}} important logistic center: the city possesses the third largest river port in Europe, directly connected to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Germany via the Meuse river and the Albert Canal. In 2006 Liège Airport was the 8th most important cargo airport in Europe. A new passenger terminal was opened in 2005. It is also the main hub and the headquarters of TNT Airways.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. {{tested the}} FAL in several forms; {{initially}} as manufactured by FN in experimental configurations, {{and later in}} the final T48 configuration as an official competitor for the new Light Self-Loading Rifle intended to replace the M1 Garand. The US Army procured T48 rifles from three firms for testing, including two U.S. based companies in an effort to assess the manufacturability of the FN design domestically. The T48 was manufactured for testing by Fabrique Nationale (<b>FN),</b> of <b>Herstal,</b> Belgium; Harrington & Richardson (H&R) of Worcester, Massachusetts; and the High Standard Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The United States also received a small number of FAL Heavy Barrel Rifles (HBAR) (either 50.41 or pre-50.41) for testing, under the designation T48E1, though none of these rifles were adopted by US.|$|R
5000|$|The UCP {{was to be}} the {{companion}} side arm to the HK MP7 submachine gun, using the same HK 4.6×30mm bottlenecked cartridge (see internal ballistics). The 4.6×30mm round is a direct competitor to the 5.7×28mm by Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN).</b> As such, the UCP would have been a direct competitor to the FN Five-seven pistol. Both have greater armor-piercing capabilities and less recoil compared to other commonly used military handgun cartridges, such as the 9×19mm Parabellum or [...]45 ACP.|$|R
5000|$|The L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, {{also known}} as the SLR (Self Loading Rifle), by the Canadian Army {{designation}} C1A1 (C1) or in the US as the [...] "inch pattern" [...] FAL. It is a British Commonwealth derivative of the Belgian FN FAL battle rifle (Fusil Automatique Léger Automatic Rifle" [...] produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> <b>FN).</b> The L1A1 is produced under licence and has seen use in the Australian Army, Canadian Army, Indian Army, Jamaica Defence Force, Malaysian Army, New Zealand Army, Rhodesian Army, South African Defence Force and the British Armed Forces.|$|R
25|$|Columbia {{enjoys a}} diversified economy, {{with the major}} {{employers}} in the area being South Carolina state government, the Palmetto Health hospital system, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, Palmetto GBA, and the University of South Carolina. The corporate headquarters of Fortune 1000 energy company, SCANA, {{are located in the}} Columbia suburb of Cayce. Other major employers in the Columbia area include Computer Sciences Corporation, Fort Jackson, the U.S. Army's largest and most active initial entry training installation, Richland School District One, Humana/TriCare, and the United Parcel Service, which operates its Southeastern Regional Hub at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Major manufacturers such as Square D, CMC Steel, Spirax Sarco, Michelin, International Paper, Pirelli Cables, Honeywell, Westinghouse Electric, Harsco Track Tech, Trane, Intertape Polymer Group, Union Switch & Signal, <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal,</b> Solectron, and Bose Technology have facilities in the Columbia area. There are over 70 foreign affiliated companies and fourteen Fortune 500 companies in the region. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Columbia metropolitan statistical area as of 2010 was $31.97 billion, the highest among MSAs in the state.|$|E
500|$|FN's 5.7×28mm {{ammunition}} types were briefly {{manufactured by}} Olin-Winchester, but {{today they are}} [...] made by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> in Belgium and (since 2006) Fiocchi in the United States. In 2009, the National Rifle Association added 5.7×28mm firearms to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in this event using 5.7×28mm firearms. Starting in 2012, Federal began producing a new 5.7×28mm round for civilian shooters, designated the AE5728A.|$|E
500|$|The FN 5.7×28mm is a small-caliber, {{high-velocity}} cartridge {{designed and}} manufactured by <b>FN</b> <b>Herstal</b> in Belgium. It is a bottlenecked centerfire cartridge that is somewhat {{similar to the}} [...]22 Hornet or [...]22 K-Hornet. Unlike many new cartridges, it has no parent case; the complete package was developed from scratch by FN. The 5.7×28mm was developed {{in conjunction with the}} FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol, in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge.|$|E
2500|$|The FN FAL is a 7.62×51mm NATO, {{selective}} fire, {{automatic rifle}} {{produced by the}} Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN).</b> During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, most notably with the British Commonwealth as the L1A1. It {{is one of the}} most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many western nations during the Cold War it was nicknamed [...] "The right arm of the Free World".|$|R
50|$|John Browning {{was known}} as a {{dedicated}} and tireless innovator and experimenter who sought breakthrough consumer-oriented features and performance and reliability improvements in small arms designs. He did not retire from his career in his elder years, but dedicated his entire adult life—literally to his last day—to these pursuits. On November 26, 1926, while working at the bench on a self-loading pistol design for Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN)</b> in Liège, he died of heart failure in the design shop of his son Val A. Browning. Even the 9 mm semi-automatic pistol he was working on when he died had great design merit and was eventually completed in 1935, by Belgian designer Dieudonne Saive. Released as the Fabrique Nationale GP35, it was more popularly known as the successful Browning Hi-Power pistol, a favorite of sportsmen, gun collectors as well as many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.|$|R
5|$|When {{the time}} came for {{developmental}} and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56mm candidate weapons were included with the 6mm candidates: the M16 HBAR, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the Fabrique Nationale de <b>Herstal</b> (<b>FN)</b> Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for {{the conversion of the}} Rodman XM235 to 5.56mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5.56mm conversion of its HK 21A1 (instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.|$|R
