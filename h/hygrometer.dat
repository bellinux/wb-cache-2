5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient <b>hygrometer</b> was made.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a <b>hygrometer),</b> and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

25|$|Each {{science has}} its own unique sets of {{laboratory}} equipment. In the atmosphere, {{there are many things}} or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime {{was one of the first}} atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the <b>hygrometer.</b> Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.|$|E
25|$|Successful snail culture {{requires}} the correct equipment and supplies, including: snail pens or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity (<b>hygrometer),</b> temperature (thermometer), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and {{an instrument to}} measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate (temperature and humidity), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails {{of the same kind}} and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.|$|E

The thesis {{is divided into}} two main parts which are a realization of the experiment and a statistic comparison and evaluation of measured data. The measuring of moisture was realized using four different types of <b>hygrometers</b> and then it was compared with the real (computed gravimetricaly) moisture of wood. The testing was realized on spruce samples. The next target was determining an effect of a density of wood on its real moisture.

[...] Of particular importance was a hair <b>hygrometer</b> that he devised and used for a series of investigations on atmospheric humidity, evaporation, clouds, fogs and rain (Essais sur l'Hygrométrie, 1783).

2500|$|Sets {{of surface}} {{measurements}} are important data to meteorologists. They give {{a snapshot of}} a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and <b>hygrometer,</b> respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, [...] flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{greenhouses}} {{and industrial}} spaces, <b>hygrometers</b> {{are also used}} in some incubators, saunas, humidors and museums. They are also used {{in the care of}} wooden musical instruments such as pianos, guitars, violins, and harps which can be damaged by improper humidity conditions. In residential settings, <b>hygrometers</b> are used to assist in humidity control (too low humidity can damage human skin and body, while too high humidity favors growth of mildew and dust mite). <b>Hygrometers</b> are also used in the coating industry because the application of paint and other coatings may be very sensitive to humidity and dew point. With a growing demand on the amount of measurements taken the psychrometer is now replaced by a dewpoint gauge known as a dewcheck. These devices make measurements a lot faster but are often not allowed in explosive environments.|$|R
2500|$|In 1441, King Sejong's son, Prince Munjong, {{invented the}} first {{standardized}} rain gauge.

In 1450, Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging-plate anemometer, and {{was known as the}} first anemometer. In 1607, Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: [...] "Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow)". In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer. In 1662, Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical, self-emptying, tipping bucket rain gauge. In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type thermometer. In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the [...] "centigrade" [...] temperature scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair <b>hygrometer</b> was demonstrated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In 1802–1803, Luke Howard wrote On the Modification of Clouds, in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. In 1806, Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds. Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published, including the International Cloud Atlas, which has remained in print ever since.
