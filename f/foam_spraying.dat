These technologies include: secondary confinement, deinventory, vapor barriers, <b>foam</b> <b>spraying,</b> and water sprays/monitors.

40|$|<b>Foam</b> <b>spraying</b> {{is often}} used as a safer {{alternative}} to droplet spraying {{in the context of}} biocides. However, there is a lack in methods and data for characterisation and assessment of potential aerosol exposure from foam spray applications, resulting in uncertainties in the authorisation of biocidal substances and products. First cursory experiments, carried out within the present study, show that aerosol release cannot generally be ruled out when using foams. The level of inhalation exposure is significantly reduced compared to conventional droplet spraying. However, the results give a first impression that the current use of droplet spraying data for exposure assessment might overestimate inhalation exposure of foam application. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to establish correlations between aerosol release and product and process parameters as the basis for exposure risk assessment These results would also provide valuable input data for implementation of <b>foam</b> <b>spraying</b> into exposure models...|$|E
40|$|<b>Foam</b> <b>spraying</b> {{is often}} used as an {{alternative}} to droplet spraying for the treatment of surfaces. It is generally assumed that aerosol exposure is considerably smaller for foam sprays compared to conventional droplet mists. This especially refers to the application of biocides in the occupational section, e. g. the disinfection in the food industry {{as well as in the}} consumer section, especially for cosmetics and household cleaning agents ("convenience products"). While there is a well-developed quantitative understanding on the physical and technical parameters determining the exposure risk when using droplet sprays, the characterization of potential aerosol exposure for the application of foams has received little attention so far. In this study the current state of knowledge on the use of foam sprays for biocide application was surveyed from the literature. In addition some exploratory aerosol measurements were carried out for typical biocide products to compare aerosol release from foam and droplet spraying. More than 55 biocidal substances, such as QAV or peracidic products as well as pyrethrins and courmarins comprising products for disinfection, insecticides and rodenticides, are used in foams. The foaming technologies can be classified as mechanical foam generation using low and high pressure and blowing agent foam generation. Since no information on aerosol formation during <b>foam</b> <b>spraying</b> was found in the literature, exploratory aerosol measurements were performed in a laboratory set-up. A reduction of a factor of three was determined for aerosol release in the three health-related size fractions (respirable, thoracic, inhalable), when the biocidal product was sprayed as a foam compared to droplet spraying. Generation of semi-solid, highly-viscous foams using physical blowing agents lowered aerosol formation more than hundred fold. The experiments show that aerosol exposure cannot generally be ruled out when using foams but increasing foam viscosity seems to reduce aerosol release. Thus, further investigations should specify to what extent foam could be explained by physical chemical data of biocidal products by using specific application techniques. These factor determine not only the primary aerosol inhalation exposure but also the risk for exposure and mobility of the environment. Correlations allowing for a prediction of aerosol release from process and product parameters have to be established in future more comprehensive experiments...|$|E

40|$|Nanotechnology {{processes}} are present into the textile field. One {{of these processes}} involves encapsulated nanoparticles or nanoproducts, know as microcapsules. Microencapsulation technology is used into textiles to confer new properties and added value. There {{are a lot of}} different active core microcapsules used in the textile industry such as durable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobials, phase change materials, etc. The effect of microcapsules is usually measured by the presence of a property such as odour measurements when flavors are encapsulated. Neverthless, some properties such as hydration, antibacterial, insect repellents, etc., canÂ´t be tested without analytical methods. Microcapsulated products can be applied on fabrics by impregnation, bath exhaustion, <b>foam,</b> <b>spraying</b> and coating. The most extended industrial application is by padding. Microcapsules useful life can be affected by fabrics testing and maintenance to which they are subjected during their lifetime. This work studies flavour microcapsules behaviour on plain and knitting fabrics applied by impregnation when these fabrics are subjected an abrasion test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used in order to determinate the quantity of microencapsulated products that remains on fabrics after abrasion tests. We concluded that the abrasion resistance test destroy the microcapsules deposited on fabrics. To sum up, we can indicate that depending on the fabric structure the abrasion test result can differ from one fabric to other...|$|E

40|$|Unvented roof {{strategies}} {{with open}} cell and closed cell <b>spray</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> insulation <b>sprayed</b> to {{the underside of}} roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 's to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated moisture related incidents reported anecdotally that raise potential concerns about the overall hygrothermal performance of these systems. The incidents related to rainwater leakage and condensation concerns. Condensation concerns have been extensively studied by others and are not further discussed in this report. This project involved hygrothermal modeling {{of a range of}} rainwater leakage and field evaluations of in-service residential roofs using <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> insulation. All of the roof assemblies modeled exhibited drying capacity to handle minor rainwater leakage. All field evaluation locations of in-service residential roofs had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. Explorations of eleven in-service roof systems were completed. The exploration involved taking a sample of <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> from the underside of the roof sheathing, exposing the sheathing, then taking a moisture content reading. All locations had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. One full-roof failure was reviewed, as an industry partner was involved with replacing structurally failed roof sheathing. In this case the manufacturer's investigation report concluded that the <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> was installed on wet OSB based on the observation that the <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> did not adhere well to the substrate and the pore structure of the closed cell <b>spray</b> <b>foam</b> at the ccSPF/OSB interface was indicative of a wet substrate...|$|R
