25|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{is easily}} {{confused with the}} Pygmy Salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species overlap in a small area of southern North Carolina. D. wrighti and D. aeneus are the smallest species in the genus Desmognathus and are the only terrestrial direct-developers, lacking a free-swimming larval stage. They both have vomerine teeth, and similar tail length to total body length ratios; however, they have different patterns and coloration. Seepage salamanders have a smoother top of the head. The mental glands are also shaped differently in the males. The pygmy salamander has a large, U-shaped mental gland while the seepage salamander's is small and <b>kidney</b> <b>shaped.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the United States, {{more than}} 12000 renal transplantations are {{performed}} annually � but the transplanted kidneys face {{a number of}} surgical and medical complications that cause a decrease in their functionality. In an effort to understand {{the reasons for this}} functionality decrease, considerable attention has recently been focused on Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) due to its superior functional and anatomical information. The biggest challenge in the analysis of DCE-MRI is the segmentation of kidneys from abdomen images because of the high noise and partial volume effects introduced during the rapid and repeated scanning process. In this paper, a general framework is introduced for the segmentation of kidneys from DCE-MR images of the abdomen. The proposed segmentation algorithm consists of three main steps. In the first step, an average <b>kidney</b> <b>shape</b> is constructed from a dataset of previously segmente...|$|R

Granules of the Apios tuber starch displayed ellipsoidal, rod, or <b>kidney</b> <b>shape</b> with diameter ranges of 1 – 30 m.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} method to {{register}} kidneys from Computed Tomography (CT) scans with and without contrast enhancement. The method builds a patient-specific <b>kidney</b> <b>shape</b> model from the contrast enhanced image, and then matches it against automatically segmented candidate surfaces extracted from the pre-contrast image to find the alignment. Only the object of interest is used to drive the alignment, providing results that are robust to near-rigid relative motions of the kidney {{with respect to the}} surrounding tissues. Shape-based features are used, as opposed to intensity-based ones, and consequently the resulting registration is invariant to the inherent contrast variations. The contributions of this work are: a surface grouping and segmentation algorithm driven by smooth curvature constraints; and a framework to register image volumes under contrast variation, relative motion and local deformation with minimal user intervention. Encouraging experimental results with real patient images, all with various kinds and sizes of kidney lesions, validate the approach.

40|$|The {{determination}} of kidney size {{is important in}} clinical field, because it can facilitate to make decisions on the management strategy. 1 Of several indexes of kidney size, kidney length was traditionally used because it can conveniently be measured using ultrasonography (US). However, considering {{the complexity of the}} <b>kidney</b> <b>shape,</b> <b>kidney</b> length can not appropriately represent kidney mass. Additionally, kidney length, as measured by US, is prone to interobserver variability and poor repeatability. 2 Kidney volume is a more sensitive index of kidney size than kidney length for the detection of renal abnormalities. 3 It is also excellent predictor of renal function and correlates very well with body indexes. 4 Furthermore, pre-transplant kidney volume is an independent determinant of the prognosis of the graft kidney. 5 Kidney volume can be measured by US, but it needs calculation using ellipsoid formulae of three-dimensional value of the kidney. 3 Moreover, the calculation using ellipsoid formulae tends to under-estimate kidney volume. 6 With development of more elaborate imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), measurement of the mass or organ volume has become feasible. The MDCT which generates 3 -D recon-struction images is particularly accurate in measurement of organ volume. 7, 8 In this study, we estimated the normal kidney volume of healthy young Korean men by using MDCT and evaluated its predictability of renal function and relationship with body indexes...|$|R
