40|$|An {{increasing}} number of metrics are {{used to measure the}} impact of research papers. Despite being the most commonly used, the 2 -year impact factor is limited by a lack of generalizability and comparability, in part due to substantial variation both within and between fields. Similar limitations apply to metrics such as citations per paper. New approaches compare a paper’s citation count to others in the research area, while others measure both social and traditional media impact. However, none of these measures take into account an individual author’s contribution to the paper or the number of authors, which we argue are key limitations. The UK’s 2014 Research <b>Exercise</b> <b>Framework</b> included a detailed bibliometric analysis comparing 15 selected metrics to a ‘gold standard’ evaluation of almost 150, 000 papers by expert panels. We outline the main correlations between the most highly regarded papers by the expert panel in the Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Neurology unit and these metrics, most of which were weak to moderate. The strongest correlation was with the SCImago Journal Rank, a variant of the journal impact factor, while the amount of Twitter activity showed no correlation. We suggest that an aggregate measure combining journal metrics, field-standardized citation data, and alternative metrics, including weighting or colour-coding of individual papers to account for author contribution, could provide more clarity...|$|E

The controller is intended to function in systems with output power levels up to 500 W and switching frequencies up to 1 MHz. Simulation data for this controller indicates high degrees of performance over a input voltage range of 12 - 48 V and an operating temperature range of - 50 ° C to 150 ° C. Significant improvement over existing synchronous rectication controllers is observed. In addition, a simulation and written <b>exercise</b> <b>framework,</b> intended to couple with circuits in a pre-existing discrete hardware kit, has been developed for a proposed class on power IC design. SPICE schematics of important circuit modules as well as relevant coursework is presented and explained.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is widely criticized for poor performance, {{and much of}} its problem stems from its poor performance in public communications. DHS {{has not been able}} to earn the respect of the public and local officials, and that means that many Americans are not paying attention to important threat warnings and security based exercises. This ultimately means our homeland security is suffering and American citizens remain vulnerable to future terror attacks. This research project considers the public communication efforts of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by analyzing how both the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) and National Exercise Program (NEP) continually fall short of effectively communicating security threats and warnings to the American public. By looking at two of its highest profile projects, HSAS and NEP, we see that the problems are largely the result of DHS taking too much of a top-down, federal approach. This thesis will argue that the highly centralized management and execution of both the HSAS and NEP fail to convey the importance of federal efforts to local levels of government and American citizens. This thesis will be a comparative case study of these two programs. I find that both programs are useful and necessary, but both can be improved by decentralizing the national <b>exercise</b> <b>framework</b> and communication efforts to local level officials who can better tailor information and response efforts pertinent to their communities. As the most important component of disaster relief and response, local level officials, who are typically overshadowed by national level personnel, can more effectively utilize federal exercise money and communicate threats the American public than DHS personnel can.

40|$|Editorial: The 2015 BCLA {{annual conference}} was another fantastic affair. It {{was the first}} time the conference was held in the {{beautiful}} city of Liverpool. The venue was great and the programme was excellent. The venue overlooked the River Mersey and many of the hotels were local boutique hotels. I stayed in one which was formerly the offices of White Star Liners—where the RMS Titanic was originally registered. The hotel decor was consistent with its historic significance. The BCLA gala dinner was held in the hugely impressive Anglican Cathedral with entertainment from a Beatles tribute band. That will certainly be a hard act to follow at the next conference in 2017. Brian Tompkins took the reigns as the new BCLA president. Professor Fiona Stapleton was the recipient of the BCLA Gold Medal Award. The winner of the poster competition was Dorota Szczesna-Iskander with a poster entitled ‘Dry Contact lens poor wettability and visual performance’. Second place was Renee Reeder with her poster entitled ‘Abnormal Rosacea as a differential diagnosis in corneal scarring’. And third place was Maria Jesus Gonzalez-Garcia with her poster entitled ‘Dry Effect of the Environmental Conditions on Tear Inflammatory Mediators Concentration in Contact Lens Wearers’. The photographic competition winner was Professor Wolfgang Sickenberger from Jena in Germany. The Editorial Panel of CLAE met at the BCLA conference for their first biannual meeting. The journal metrics were discussed. In terms of number of submissions of new papers CLAE seems to have plateaued after seeing a rapid growth in the number of submissions over the last few years. The increase over the last few years could be attributed to the fact that CLAE was awarded an impact factor for the first time in 2012. This year it seems that impact factors across nearly all ophthalmic related journals has dropped. This could in part be due to the fact that last year was a ‘Research <b>Exercise</b> <b>Framework</b> (REF) year for UK universities, where they are judged on quality of their research output. The next REF is in 2020 so we may see changes nearing that time. Looking at article downloads, there seems to be a continued rise in figures. Currently CLAE attracts around 85, 000 downloads per year (this is an increase of around 10, 000 per year for the last few years) and the 2015 prediction is 120, 000 ! With this in mind and with other contributing factors too, the BCLA has decided to move to online delivery of CLAE to its members starting from issue 5 of 2015. Some members do like to flick through the pages of a hard copy of the journal so members will still have the option of receiving a hard copy through the post but the default journal delivery method will now be online. The BCLA office will send various alerts and content details to members email addresses. To access CLAE online you will need to log in via the BCLA web page, currently you then click on ‘Resources’ and then under ‘Free and Discounted Publications’ you will see CLAE. This actually takes you to CLAE’s own webpage (www. contactlensjournal. com) but you need to log in via the BCLA web page. The BCLA plans to change these weblinks so that from the BCLA web page you can link to the journal website much more easily and you have the choice of going directly into the general website for CLAE or straight to the current issue. In 2016 you will see an even easier way of accessing CLAE online as the BCLA will launch a CLAE application for mobile devices where the journal can be downloaded as a ‘flick-book’. This is a great way of bringing CLAE into the modern era where people access their information in newer ways. For many the BCLA conference was part of a very busy conference week as it was preceded by the International Association of Contact Lens Educators’ (IACLE) Third World Congress, held in Manchester on the 4 days before the BCLA conference. The first and second IACE World Congresses were held in Waterloo, Canada in 1994 and 2000 respectively and hosted by Professor Des Fonn. Professor Fonn was the recipient of the first ever IACLE lifetime achievement award. The Third IACLE World Congress saw more than 100 contact lens educators and industry representatives from around 30 countries gather in the UK for the four-day event, hosted by The University of Manchester. Delegates gained hands-on experience of innovations in teaching, such as learning delivery systems, the use of iPads in the classroom and for creating ePub content, and augmented and virtual reality technologies. IACLE members around the world also took part via a live online broadcast.

40|$|As we {{settle into}} a new year, this second issue of Contact Lens and Anterior Eye allows us to reflect on how new {{research}} in this field impacts our understanding, but more importantly, how we use this evidence basis to enhance our day to day practice, to educate the next generation of students and to construct the research studies to deepen our knowledge still further. The end of 2014 saw the publication of the UK governments Research <b>Exercise</b> <b>Framework</b> (REF) which ranks Universities in terms of their outputs (which includes their paper, publications and research income), environment (infrastructure and staff support) {{and for the first time}} impact (defined as “any effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academia” [8]). The REF is a process of expert review, carried out in 36 subject-based units of assessment, of which our field is typically submitted to the Allied Health, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy panel. Universities that offer Optometry did very well with Cardiff, Manchester and Aston in the top 10 % out of the 94 Universities that submitted to this panel (Grade point Average ranked order). While the format of the new exercise (probably in 2010) to allocate the more than £ 2 billion of UK government research funds is yet to be determined, it is already rumoured that impact will contribute an even larger proportion to the weighting. Hence it is even more important to reflect on the impact of our research. In this issue, Elisseef and colleagues [5] examine the intriguing potential of modifying a lens surface to allow it to bind to known wetting agents (in this case hyaluronic acid) to enhance water retention. Such a technique has the capacity to reduced friction between the lens surface and the eyelids/ocular surface, presumably leading to higher comfort and less reason for patients to discontinue with lens wear. Several papers in this issue report on the validity of new high precision, fast scanning imaging and quantification equipment, utilising techniques such as Scheimpflug, partial coherence interferometry, aberrometry and video allowing detailed assessment of anterior chamber biometry, corneal topography, corneal biomechanics, peripheral refraction, ocular aberrations and lens fit. The challenge is how to use this advanced instrumentation which is becoming increasingly available to create real impact. Many challenges in contact lenses and the anterior eye still prevail in 2015 such as: -While contact lens and refractive surgery complications are relatively rare, they are still too often devastating to the individual and their quality of life (such as the impact and prognosis of patients with Acanthmoeba Keratitis reported by Jhanji and colleagues in this issue [7]). How can we detect those patients who are going to be affected and what modifications do we need to make to contact lenses and patient management prevent this occurring? -Drop out from contact lenses still occurs at a rapid rate and symptoms of dry eye seem to be the leading cause driving this discontinuation of wear [1] and [2]. What design, coating, material and lubricant release mechanism will make a step change in end of day comfort in particular? -Presbyopia is a major challenge to hassle free quality vision and is one of the first signs of ageing noticed by many people. As an emmetrope approaching presbyopia, I have a vested interest in new medical devices that will give me high quality vision at all distances when my arms won’t stretch any further. Perhaps a new definition of presbyopia could be when you start to orientate your smartphone in the landscape direction to gain the small increase in print size needed to read! Effective accommodating intraocular lenses that truly mimic the pre-presbyopic crystalline lenses are still a way off [3] and hence simultaneous images achieved through contact lenses, intraocular lenses or refractive surgery still have a secure future. However, splitting light reaching the retina and requiring the brain to supress blurred images will always be a compromise on contrast sensitivity and is liable to cause dysphotopsia; so how will new designs account for differences in a patient's task demands and own optical aberrations to allow focused patient selection, optimising satisfaction? -Drug delivery from contact lenses offers much in terms of compliance and quality of life for patients with chronic ocular conditions such as glaucoma, dry eye and perhaps in the future, dry age-related macular degeneration; but scientific proof-of-concept publications (see EIShaer et al. [6]) have not yet led to commercial products. Part of this is presumably the regulatory complexity of combining a medical device (the contact lens) and a pharmaceutical agent. Will 2015 be the year when this innovation finally becomes a reality for patients, bringing them an enhanced quality of life through their eye care practitioners and allowing researchers to further validate the use of pharmaceutical contact lenses and propose enhancements as the technology matures? -Last, but no means least is the field of myopia control, the topic of the first day of the BCLA's Conference in Liverpool, June 6 – 9 th 2015. The epidemic of myopia is a blight, particularly in Asia, with significant concerns over sight threatening pathology resulting from the elongated eye. This is a field where real impact is already being realised through new soft contact lens optics, orthokeratology and low dose pharmaceuticals [4], but we still need to be able to better predict which technique will work best for an individual and to develop new techniques to retard myopia progression in those who don’t respond to current treatments, without increasing their risk of complications or the treatment impacting their quality of life So what will your New Year's resolution be to make 2015 a year of real impact, whether by advancing science or applying the findings published in journals such as Contact Lens and Anterior Eye to make a real difference to your patients’ lives...|$|E

40|$|Crisis {{management}} exercises sometimes produce weak or vague learning {{results with}} very limited applicability. This paper addresses these problems {{by developing a}} theoretical framework on learning from crisis management <b>exercises.</b> The <b>framework</b> focuses on necessary requirements and beneficial factors for the conceptual learning of individuals from discussion-based exercises. The variation theory of learning was identified in the literature. According to this theory, a learner’s capability stems {{from his or her}} ability to discern relevant situational aspects and the resulting potential for simultaneous awareness of and acting upon them. The central assumption of the framework is that learners are required to experience variation to achieve conceptual learning. The framework connects learning aspects of scenarios and discussions to the potential for improvement of the individual’s capabilities. Based on the framework we suggest that exercise scenarios should be represented as a set of parameters, and that variation of the parameter set and the parameter values becomes the central theme of the exercise activity. Thinking in terms of parameters emphasises variation and invariance before, during and after an exercise session, thus supporting learning. The proposed framework can be used to understand and manage discussion-based crisis exercises from a conceptual learning perspective...|$|R
