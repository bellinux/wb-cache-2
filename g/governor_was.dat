5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with this fall in approval rating, an initiative {{to recall the}} <b>Governor</b> <b>was</b> started {{for the first and}} only time ever in New Jersey history. The recall effort failed after gathering less than the required 1.2million signatures.|$|E

5|$|Mari {{was deserted}} for two generations before being {{restored}} by the Akkadian king Manishtushu. A <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> appointed {{to govern the}} city who held the title Shakkanakku (military governor). Akkad kept direct control over the city, which is evident by Naram-Sin of Akkad's appointment of two of his daughters to priestly offices in the city.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1884, the Department of Alaska was redesignated the District of Alaska, an {{incorporated}} but {{unorganized territory}} with a civil government. The <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed by the}} President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Pollock's {{remaining}} time as <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> less eventful. While exploring Tonga in May 1923, {{he discovered}} a turtle {{which had been}} branded by Captain Cook on his expedition there in 1773. The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years. He was ordered home on July 26, 1923.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2010, {{unlike most}} other states, New Jersey {{did not have}} the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Until 2010, when the office of <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> vacant or the <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> unable to fulfill his/her duties through injury, the President of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the next general election, until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died or resigned less than 16 months before end of the term, {{until the end of the}} term. Richard Codey served as acting governor of New Jersey until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post. The position of lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> created in the 2005 state election effective with the 2009 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor of Indiana serves as acting governor when the governor becomes incapacitated.

5|$|The longest-serving <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> George Wallace, {{who served}} 16 years over four terms. The {{shortest}} {{term for a}} non-acting <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> that of Hugh McVay, who served {{four and a half}} months after replacing the resigning Clement Comer Clay. Lurleen Wallace, wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey, who took office on April 10, 2017. She is the second female governor of Alabama.|$|E

5|$|Washington was {{admitted}} to the Union on November 11, 1889. The term for <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> four years, commencing on the second Monday in the January following the election. If the office of <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> vacant or the <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>are</b> unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve. The office of lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> not elected on the same ticket as the governor.|$|R
50|$|As in all states, a popularly elected {{governor}} heads Maryland's executive branch. The <b>governor's</b> cabinet <b>is</b> {{known as the}} Executive Council.

The <b>Governor</b> <b>is</b> elected under the plurality system. The current <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> Larry Hogan.|$|R
5|$|The {{office of}} <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} by the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the end}} of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> created with {{the adoption of}} the first Constitution of Indiana in August 1816. The position was filled by an October election.

5|$|Tyler's {{political}} fortunes were growing; he {{was considered}} as a possible candidate in the legislative deliberation for the 1824 U.S. Senate election. He was nominated in December 1825 for governor of Virginia, a position which was then appointed by the legislature. Tyler was elected 131–81 over John Floyd. The office of <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> powerless under the original Virginia Constitution (1776–1830), lacking even veto authority. Tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could do little to influence the legislature. His most visible act as <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> delivering the funeral address for former president Jefferson, a Virginian, who had died on July 4, 1826. Tyler was deeply devoted to Jefferson, and his eloquent eulogy was well received.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's term as <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> {{marked by}} {{modestly}} progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and {{the repeal of}} laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line. Agnew's attempt to adopt a new state constitution {{was rejected by the}} voters in a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as <b>governor</b> <b>was</b> {{appointing}} Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to}} the legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term as governor.|$|E
