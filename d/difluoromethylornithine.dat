40|$|The {{induction}} of {{the activity}} of cerebral ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 17) and mRNA by electrical stimulation exhibits regional differences. The effects of the enzyme inhibitor <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> on these regional variations was examined. Administration of this inhibitor resulted in pronounced depression of both basal and induced activity of ornithine decarboxylase in the hippocampus. Basal activity of the enzyme in the neocortex and the cerebellum appeared to be resistant to <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> but the induced enzyme activity was sensitive {{to the effects of}} this inhibitor. Susceptibility to <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> may be directly correlated with a slower turnover rate for ornithine decarboxylase. These results suggest that ornithine decarboxylase in the hippocampus may possess a longer half-life than its counterparts in other regions of the brain. Pretreatment with <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> had no effect on the induced ornithine decarboxylase mRNA in the neocortex. Thus, elevated activity of ornithine decarboxylase enzyme, due to electrical stimulation, appears to not have any effect on either the transcription or the decay rate of the induced ornithine decarboxylase mRNA.

To test a role for polyamines in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis, we administered the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> to two mouse models [...] the low-dose streptozotocin model and the NOD model [...] to deplete intracellular polyamines, and administered streptozotocin to a third model, which was haploinsufficient for the gene encoding the hypusination enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase. Subsequent development of diabetes and/or glucose intolerance was monitored. In the low-dose streptozotocin mouse model, continuous <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> administration dose-dependently reduced the incidence of hyperglycemia and led to the preservation of β cell area, whereas in the NOD mouse model of autoimmune diabetes <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> reduced diabetes incidence by 50 %, preserved β cell area and insulin secretion, led to reductions in both islet inflammation and potentially diabetogenic Th 17 cells in pancreatic lymph nodes. <b>Difluoromethylornithine</b> treatment reduced hypusinated eIF 5 A levels in both immune cells and islets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} initial evaluation of a human cell assay to identify potentially efficacious agents for preventing melanoma. Four human cell lines were used: normal melanocytes, a radial growth-phase-like melanoma cell line (WM 3211), a vertical growth-phase-like melanoma cell line (Lu 1205), and 83 - 2 c, a cell strain cloned from metastatic melanoma. Four endpoints were evaluated in ultraviolet B-treated cells: annexin V, human leukocyte antigen-DR; E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Annexin V was induced by nimesulide, 4 -hydroxyphenylretinamide, and <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> in ultraviolet-B-treated radial growth-phase-like melanoma cells. None of the agents inhibited human leukocyte antigen-DR expression in ultraviolet-B-treated radial growth-phase-like melanoma cells, the only cells that strongly expressed human leukocyte antigen-DR. E-cadherin was overexpressed only in radial growth-phase-like melanoma cells relative to melanocytes, and ultraviolet B exposure dramatically reduced this expression. E-cadherin was only induced by <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> in ultraviolet-B-treated radial growth-phase-like melanoma cells. N-cadherin was over- expressed in all melanoma cell lines relative to melanocytes. In this s tudy, all candidate preventive agents inhibited N-cadherin in ultraviolet B-treated radial growth-phase-like melanoma cells. Four agents inhibited N-cadherin in ultraviolet B-treated vertical growth-phase-like melanoma cells. The mean ratios of N-cadherin to E-cadherin levels and specific endpoint responses for both the radial growth-phase-like melanoma and vertical growth-phase-like melanoma cells were used to rank the agents. Agents were evaluated at clinically relevant concentrations. The rankings were <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> > 4 - hydroxyphenylretinamide > nimesulide > 9 -cis-retinoic acid > polyphenon E.

40|$|Glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), {{the parent}} {{compound}} of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), was synthesized and tested {{for its ability}} to inhibit the biosynthesis of polyamines. It was found to be a powerful competitive inhibitor of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 50), yet the lack of the methyl group at the glyoxal portion increased the apparent Ki value for the enzyme by about 30 -fold in comparison with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). Glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) inhibited diamine oxidase (EC 1. 4. 3. 6) activity as effectively as did methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). The cellular accumulation curves of glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) in L 1210 cells were practically superimposable with those of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), and the uptake of both compounds was distinctly stimulated by a prior treatment with 2 -difluoromethylornithine. The drug decreased the concentration of spermidine in a dose-dependent manner and, in contrast with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), without a concomitant accumulation of putrescine. The fact that putrescine concentrations were decreased in cells exposed to glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was, at least in part, attributable to an inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 17) activity in cells treated with the compound. Under these experimental conditions equivalent concentrations of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) [1, 1 '-[(methylethanediylidine) dinitrilo]diguanidine] elicited large increases in the enzyme activity.

40|$|Polyamines {{are highly}} {{regulated}} essential cations that are elevated in rapidly proliferating tissues, including diverse cancers. Expression analyses in neuroblastomas suggest that upregulation of polyamine pro-synthetic enzymes and downregulation of catabolic enzymes {{is associated with}} poor prognosis. Polyamine sufficiency may be required for MYCN oncogenicity in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma, and targeting polyamine homeostasis may therefore provide an attractive therapeutic approach. ODC 1, an oncogenic MYCN target, is rate-limiting for polyamine synthesis, and is overexpressed in many cancers including neuroblastoma. Inhibition of ODC 1 by <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> (DFMO) decreased tumour penetrance in TH-MYCN mice treated pre-emptively, and extended survival and synergized with chemotherapy in treating established tumours in both TH-MYCN and xenograft models. Efforts to augment DFMO activity, or otherwise maximally reduce polyamine levels, are focused on antagonizing polyamine uptake or augmenting polyamine export or catabolism. Since polyamine inhibition appears to be clinically well tolerated, these approaches, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, have great potential for improving neuroblastoma outcome in both MYCN amplified and non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new micromethod to study the effect of drugs on microsporidia, using MRC 5 fibroblasts infected by 10 (5) spores of Encephalitozoon cuniculi. After 3 days of incubation with various concentrations of drugs, parasitic foci were counted in stained cultures. The inhibition of microsporidial growth exceeding 90 % with albendazole (0. 005 microgram/ml), fumagillin (0. 001 microgram/ml), 5 -fluorouracil (3 micrograms/ml), and sparfloxacin (30 micrograms/ml) was observed. Chloroquine, pefloxacin, azithromycin, and rifabutin were partially effective, at high concentrations. Arprinocid, metronidazole, minocycline, doxycycline, itraconazole, and <b>difluoromethylornithine</b> were not evaluable, since concentrations that inhibited microsporidia were also toxic for fibroblasts. Pyrimethamine, piritrexim, sulfonamides, paromomycin, roxithromycin, atovaquone, and flucytosine were ineffective. Our results confirm that albendazole and fumagillin have marked activity against E. cuniculi and show the antimicrosporidial activity of 5 -fluorouracil and sparfloxacin. These data may {{form the basis for}} treatment of Encephalitozoon hellem and Septata intestinalis infections and represent an attempt to identify drugs effective against Enterocytozoon bieneusi...|$|E
