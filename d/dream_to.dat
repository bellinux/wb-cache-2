40|$|Pipe dreams {{represent}} permutations pictorially as {{a series}} of crossing pipes. Re-cent applications of pipe dreams include the calculation of Schubert polynomials, fillings of moon polyominoes, and in the combinatorics of antidiagonal simplicial complexes. These applications associate pipe <b>dreams</b> <b>to</b> words of elementary sym-metric transpositions via a canonical mapping. However, this canonical mapping {{is by no means the}} only way of mapping pipe <b>dreams</b> <b>to</b> permutation words. We define sensical mappings from pipe <b>dreams</b> <b>to</b> words and prove sensical mappings are in bijection with standard shifted tableaux of triangular shape. We characterize the set of pipe <b>dreams</b> associated <b>to</b> a given word (under any sensical map) using step ladder moves. These moves induce a partial order on the set of pipe <b>dreams</b> mapping <b>to</b> a given word, yielding a distributive lattice. ...|$|R

5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a <b>dream</b> <b>to</b> build a temple for him which he did as directed.

The temple was {{under the control of}} the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought {{under the control of the}} Afghan General Kalapahad.

5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the <b>dream</b> <b>to</b> Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
5|$|Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is an {{executive}} {{editor in chief}} of a book publishing company. After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because she violated the terms of her work visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), to marry her. She reminds Andrew that if she's deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, and he'll be set back in his <b>dream</b> <b>to</b> become an editor. Mr. Gilbertson, a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret agrees.|$|E
5|$|The Android {{operating}} system was officially unveiled in November 2007 {{along with the}} founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA); a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.

While Google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android, only one was to be released in the United States that year—the HTC Dream. Plans called for the <b>Dream</b> <b>to</b> be released on T-Mobile USA {{by the end of the}} year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the holiday shopping season.
