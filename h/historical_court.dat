The latter, you may remember, fell a {{victim to the}} small-pox, and the disgusting body, that had so lately been almost worshipped, was deserted, the moment he was dead. It was left for hours, without even the usual decent observances. It was on the same occasion, we have been told, that his grandchildren, {{including}} the heir, were assembled in a private drawing-room, waiting the result, when they were startled by a hurried trampling of feet. It was the courtiers, rushing in a crowd, to pay their homage to the new monarch! All these things forced themselves painfully on our minds, as we walked through the state rooms. Indeed there are few {{things that can be}} more usefully studied, or which awaken a greater source of profitable recollections, than a palace that has been occupied by a great and <b>historical</b> <b>court.</b> Still they are not poetical.|$|E

Leschi was twice tried for murder by the {{territorial}} government (his first trial {{resulted in a}} hung jury), convicted the second time, and then hanged outside Fort Steilacoom, the U.S. Army having refused to allow his execution to occur on Army property as military commanders considered him a lawful combatant.

Its goal is to search for concrete connections in the development of photographic copyrights worldwide, and in the local Czech context. Currently, photography touches all aspects of human activity, and because of the this, a historical analysis of this development of protection is necessary to completely understand photography?s current, contemporary position and direction. For this reason, several <b>historical</b> <b>court</b> cases have been included, which have been key in the fight to legitimize photography as an art, and crucial in giving legal recognition to the photographer as an author of a work, protected by law...|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} the High Court of Australia’s development of limitations on state legislative power to affect state courts and, in particular, the Court’s {{acceptance of the}} concept of ‘defining characteristics’ of a ‘court’ as a touchstone for constitutional validity.

The characteristics of the <b>historical</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals are contrasted with the modern idealised constitutional conception of a ‘court’. The article concludes with a critique of the failure of the ‘defining characteristics’ approach adequately to explain or {{to take into account the}} historical existence of the Court of Appeals, and identifies some ways in which it might be more satisfactorily accommodated within, and might influence, ch III jurisprudence.

40|$|Historically, Australian court {{architecture}} layout, {{design and}} details are intimately {{tied to the}} physical aspects of British imperial institutions.  Displaying the visual features of the Empire’s institutions {{has the effect of}} alienating Indigenous people within courts. This is compounded by design that is oblivious to the needs of Indigenous users and consequently places these users in situations that threaten their privacy, safety and wellbeing. This article contends that architectural design that seeks to accommodate Indigenous cultural and socio- spatial needs brings into sharp relief the barriers and harms otherwise confronting Indigenous people in courts. This article discusses three court complexes designed in collaboration with Indigenous communities to accommodate Indigenous connections to the environment surrounding the courthouse and to enhance access to justice. Indigenous collaborations {{in the design of the}} Indigenous-inclusive court complexes at Port Augusta (South Australia), Kalgoorlie and Kununurra (Western Australia) produced spatially distinct courthouses that eschew some <b>historical</b> <b>court</b> design principles and attempt to introduce features relevant to local Indigenous nations. This illustration essay discusses the emergence of Indigenous design principles that may inform courthouse redesign, the application of some of these principles in new courthouse designs and the need for local Indigenous oversight in the design processes. It provides a framework for further research into how Indigenous architectural collaborations in courthouse designs may promote safer and fairer environments for Indigenous court users. It also raises some potential disjuncture between court design and use of court space that may undermine the vision embedded in cultural design principles...|$|E

40|$|Charlemagne’s court {{offers us}} {{a vision of}} the {{important}} place of animals in court culture: from hunts to exotic gifts such as the elephant he took on the Saxon campaign in 799, these creatures were part of the ideal of bringing life to what Hincmar described as the ‘insensible’ walls of the palace, and how the dialogue between walls and inhabitants weave together to create both life and history in a manner reminiscent of both tapestry and manuscript illumination (such as that found in the Très riches heures). The role of animals is then equally central to the ‘translation’ of that <b>historical</b> <b>court</b> into the vernacular epic tradition. Through Charles’s dreams, animals become privileged interlocutors as well as embodiments {{of the life of the}} palace. However, it is at this point that the dream turns to nightmare, following on from those visions of the emperor in hell being tortured for unspecified sexual transgressions. In this context, it seems fruitful to examine the Roland’s construction of a court art in which the walls come to life by first becoming animal and then acceding to speech that is disturbingly not entirely human. Exploring this, I locate the Roland in relation to the motifs characteristic of the work of the Swiss sculptor and artist, H. R. Giger, creator of the monsters featured in Ridley Scott’s (dir.) 1979 film, Alien, and its sequels. Giger’s designs here and other productions make extensive use of monumental relief sculptural styles clearly influenced by the palace art of various ancient cultures. What connects Giger’s work and the Roland in particular is a process of deformation affecting both representation and language. In this regard, the Roland itself and the animals it represents become symbolic also of the very process of an oral or pseudo-oral tradition of transmission in which features blur and recede in the manner of a dream...|$|E
40|$|DRIVER–CAR INTERACTION & SAFETY 2016 June 16 th – 17 th 2016 In spring 2016, the 5 th year of {{the conference}} series Driver – Car Interaction & Safety (formerly DCII – Driver-Car Interaction & Interfaces) took place again in Prague city center, in the {{historical}} building of Faculty of Transpiration Sciences, Czech Technical University in Prague. The conference DCIS, in 2014 organized in our detached faculty facility in Decin,  loosely picks up the threads of successful conference DCII 2010 which was co-organized by Faculty of Transportation Sciences of Czech Technical University in Prague {{a few years ago}} and previous volumes of the conference (DCII 2008, DCII 2009 and DCII 2010). The main mission of this conference is to continue on the discussion on the theme of interaction between Human-Machine-Infrastructure and factors influencing the road traffic safety and all the problems connected with these topics. It covered subjects which are partially sub/problems of the Human Machine Interaction and behavior influenced by road traffic, as well results from very distant disciplines. DCIS gathers under one roof the results of the research in many scientific and industrial branches, which are based on safety, transportation, industrial design, medicine or psychology. The part called “safety” gathers in additional approaches of forensic experts and road safety inspectors.   The conference was opened to participants coming from areas of basic and/or applied research, forensic experts’ departments, car industries, design and ergonomics, medical research etc. With the half-ten jubilee, this event was composed hand in hand with the original exhibition devoted to 100 years of development of Czech car bodywork focused on cabriolet and coupé style cars. Because of that, besides the standard scientific presentation which papers are included in this issue of AP CTU Proceedings, a portion of historical papers were also presented within a special session giving the attendees an interesting look into the history illustrated with real exhibits on display in a <b>historical</b> <b>court</b> of our faculty building. This issue contains a selection of scientific papers based on presentations talks and posters on display by the occasion of the 5 th volume of DCIS, which successfully passed a rigorous review process. The exhibition itself is documented with printed commented catalogue in both the Czech and English languages. doc. Ing. Petr Bouchner, Ph.
