50|$|In August {{the band}} added Robbin Thompson as lead vocalist. Thompson {{had been the}} lead singer with Mercy Flight, a Richmond-based band that had {{regularly}} opened for Steel Mill. He made his debut with Steel Mill on August 29 at the 3rd Annual Nashville Music Festival, sponsored by WMAC. Steel Mill was one of about twenty different acts to take part. Headliners included Roy Orbison, Brian Hyland, Ronnie Milsap, Bobby Bloom, Ballin' <b>Jack,</b> <b>Ten</b> Wheel Drive and The Illusion. Steel Mill {{was one of only}} a handful of acts on the bill without a record contract - some college students with connections on the festival’s organizing committee had seen Steel Mill perform previously in Richmond and helped the band gain a slot on the bill.|$|R
5000|$|The Zolīte playing deck {{consists}} {{of all the}} Aces, Kings, Queens, <b>Jacks,</b> <b>Tens</b> and Nines plus the 8 of diamonds and 7 of diamonds. This gives a total of 26 cards.

The Queen of Clubs is the strongest card in the deck followed in order of strength by the Queen of Spades, Hearts and Diamonds and then the Jack of Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds and then the Ace, Ten, King, 9, 8, 7 of diamonds [...] The remaining 12 cards are suits of Clubs, Spades and Hearts comprising in order of strength the Ace, Ten, King and 9.

50|$|The game {{is played}} by four players in fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise. Normally a German-suited piquet deck is used, but as in Skat and other games played with this pack it can be {{replaced}} by a French-suited piquet deck consisting of the 32 cards of the ranks ace, king, queen, <b>jack,</b> <b>ten</b> and 7-9. The suits are irrelevant for this game, and the ranks are not ordered in a hierarchy. Aces and tens have card-point values of 10 points each, while all other cards have no card-point value. This schedule appears to be a simplification of the usual schedule in Ace-Ten card games used by Ristikontra. Together with the 10 points awarded for winning the last trick, there are 90 points in a deal. The object is to win more than half of them, i.e. at least 50 points.|$|R

50|$|The set {{of cards}} is a {{complete}} regular set of playing cards, consisting of four suits with a king, queen, <b>jack</b> and <b>ten</b> pip cards.

That would settle it with any girl worth her salt, and this one will fetch <b>Jack</b> in <b>ten</b> days, or less." ...|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that this}} scale keeps the 40 high card point system intact. The scale may seem cumbersome, {{but if one}} {{considers}} the ace and ten honors [...] "hard" [...] and the queen and jack honors [...] "soft" [...] {{it is much easier}} to accurately count high card points by using the familiar 4-3-2-1 system and then adjusting. One can see that the ace and queen have something in common in that they are both [...] "off" [...] by a half point. The <b>jack</b> and <b>ten</b> are also both [...] "off" [...] by a quarter point. So for example, a hand with one of each honor (A, K, Q, J, 10) would be counted as 10 HCP. Since the hard and soft values are equal (the ace and queen cancel out, and the <b>jack</b> and <b>ten</b> cancel out), there is no adjustment. On the other hand, to take an extreme example, a hand with four aces and four tens (no kings, queens, or jacks) would be counted at 16 HCP at first, but since it holds eight hard values and no soft values, it is adjusted to 19 HCP.|$|R
5000|$|Card ranks are {{sometimes}} assigned the alternative card-point values ace 5, king 4, queen 3, <b>jack</b> 2 and <b>ten</b> 1. In this case tens are low {{and there are}} 60 card-points in the pack, and 31 are needed to win the game.|$|R
40|$|A royal {{flush in}} poker {{consists}} of the ace, king, queen, <b>jack</b> and <b>ten,</b> {{all in the same}} suit. Our magic begins by having the spectator choose one of the cards in any of the four royal flushes. This choice could be by random draw or the spectator can merely think of one of the 20 cards. In either case he does not inform the magician of his choice but will write it on a slip of paper for future reference...|$|R

50|$|The game {{is played}} by four players in fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise. A {{standard}} pack of 52 cards is used. The suits are irrelevant for this game, and the ranks are not ordered in a hierarchy. The cards have the card-point values that are standard for games of the Ace-Ten family: ace 11, king 4, queen 3, <b>jack</b> 2, <b>ten</b> 10. There are 120 card-points in the pack. The object {{of the game is}} to win more than half the card-points in tricks, i.e. at least 61 points. A party that wins all card-points wins double.|$|R
50|$|Smear is a point-trick game, i.e. {{the winner}} of Game is {{determined}} by the total value of the cards won in tricks, rather than the number of tricks won. The card-values are Ace = 4, King = 3, Queen = 2, <b>Jack</b> = 1, <b>Ten</b> = 10, all other cards = 0 regardless of suit.|$|R

50|$|As with LTC, players seeking greater {{accuracy}} {{can also}} make adjustments to the NLTC. While the LTC normally uses only whole numbers and players who adjust with LTC commonly adjust in ½-loser increments, as the NLTC uses fractions already, and so adjustments are usually made in ¼-loser increments or smaller. Players may wish to do this as <b>Jacks</b> and <b>Tens</b> are assigned no value in the NLTC, but these cards hold additional value, particularly when they're {{together in the same}} suit supporting honors in the suit. Similarly, they may wish to consider a singleton King as being more valuable than a singleton 2. As with other methods of evaluation, players can upgrade or downgrade the value of a given holding based on the ensuing auction.|$|R
