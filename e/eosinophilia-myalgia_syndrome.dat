50|$|Its {{cause is}} unknown, {{but it is}} {{unrelated}} to capillary leak syndrome (which may cause similar swelling episodes) and <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (which features eosinophilia but alternative symptoms).

50|$|<b>Eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) is {{an incurable}} and {{sometimes}} fatal flu-like neurological condition {{linked to the}} ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms {{may be related to}} the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain).|$|E
50|$|There {{was a large}} {{outbreak}} of <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fact that}} the Showa Denko {{facility}} used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> has been cited as evidence of a need for [...] "close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech.|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to drugs {{are a common}} cause of eosinophilia, with manifestations ranging from diffuse maculopapular rash, to severe life-threatening drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drugs that {{have been shown to}} cause DRESS are aromatic anticonvulsants and other antiepileptics, sulfonamides, allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and certain antibiotics. Phenibut, an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA, has also been implicated in high doses. The reaction which {{has been shown to be}} T-cell mediated may also cause <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first case}} of <b>Eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> was {{reported}} to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in November 1989, although some cases had occurred as early as 2-3 years before this.

He recovered and returned to the ice in February 1992. His efforts in returning to the league after the illness earned him the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 1992. On June 20, 1993, with the expansion draft for the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim approaching, the Islanders traded him to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall and a swap of first-round picks. Four days later, the Panthers claimed him in the expansion draft.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in eosinophils, i.e., {{the presence of}} more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an eosinophilia, and is typically seen in people with a parasitic infestation of the intestines; autoimmune and collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and Systemic lupus erythematosus; malignant diseases such as eosinophilic leukemia, clonal hypereosinophilia, and Hodgkin's disease; lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia; extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis); Addison's disease and other causes of low corticosteroid production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); reflux esophagitis (in which eosinophils will {{be found in the}} squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and eosinophilic esophagitis; and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma. In 1989, contaminated L-tryptophan supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which was reminiscent of the Toxic Oil Syndrome in Spain in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amino acid}} {{tryptophan}} is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is subsequently converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin. Since serotonin deficiency {{has been recognized}} as a possible cause of depression, {{it has been suggested}} that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may therefore improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. 5-HTP and tryptophan are sold over the counter in North America, but requires a prescription in Europe. Small studies have been performed using 5-HTP and tryptophan as adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for depression. While some studies had positive results, they were criticized for having methodological flaws, and a more recent study did not find sustained benefit from their use. [...] The safety of these medications has not been well studied. [...] Due to the lack of high quality studies, preliminary nature of studies showing effectiveness, the lack of adequate study on their safety, and reports of <b>Eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with tryptophan use, the use of tryptophan and 5-HTP is not highly recommended or thought to be clinically useful.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s Showa Denko applied genetic {{engineering}} to the bacteria it {{used in the}} fermentation through which it manufactured tryptophan so that the bacteria would be more efficient. [...] At the same, they also changed the technique used to purify the tryptophan. Some epidemiological studies traced an outbreak of <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) to L-tryptophan supplied by Showa Denko. [...] It was further hypothesized that one or more trace impurities produced during the manufacture of tryptophan may {{have been responsible for}} the EMS outbreak. [...] The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce L-tryptophan gave rise to speculation that {{genetic engineering}} was responsible for such impurities. However, the methodology used in the initial epidemiological studies has been criticized. [...] An alternative explanation for the 1989 EMS outbreak is that large doses of tryptophan produce metabolites which inhibit the normal degradation of histamine and excess histamine in turn has been proposed to cause EMS. Once the link between EMS and Showa Denko's tryptophan had been established, chemical analyses of the tryptophan was performed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Japanese National Institute of Hygienic Sciences to determine if any contaminants were associated with EMS. Showa Denko reportedly destroyed the GM bacterial stocks after the EMS cases began to emerge.|$|E

In 1994, she co-discovered KSHVhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED61338F933A15751C1A962958260&scp=41&sq=moore+chang&st=nyt, also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), working with her husband Patrick S. Moore at Columbia University. Chang trained in neuropathology at Stanford University under the noted clinical neuropathologist, Dikran Houroupian, publishing studies on <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. During this period she contributed to studies led by her friend, Julie Parsonnet, showing that Helicobacter pylori is a cause for gastric cancer. She moved to Columbia University to pursue her first academic appointment as a clinician-scientist. Although initially interested in using representational difference analysis to study the genetic origins of brain tumors, she applied this technique to Kaposi's sarcoma resulting in the discovery of this new human tumor virus. Drs. Chang, Moore and collaborators subsequently showed that this virus was the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, while others showed it to be the cause of some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. From two small DNA fragments representing less than 1% of the viral genome, she cloned the entire KSHV 165 kbase genome and fully sequenced the virus genome within two years after its initial discovery http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8962146&query_hl=6&itool=pubmed_docsum.

In this study, implicated L-TRP, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade L-TRP, or vehicle was administered by gavage in a blinded fashion for 38 d to female Lewis rats at doses comparable with those ingested by patients who developed the <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Animals receiving implicated L-TRP, but not those receiving USP grade L-TRP or vehicle, developed histologic signs consistent with fasciitis and perimyositis, specific pathologic features of human L-TRP-EMS.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} the specific {{nature of the}} neurocognitive impairments of <b>eosinophilia-myalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EMS) in an unselected population, and to present longitudinal patterns.  METHODS—A consecutive sample of 23 patients with EMS and 18 age and education matched control subjects were assessed on a comprehensive neuropsycho- logical battery. Longitudinal results were gathered from six patients.  RESULTS—Neurocognitive impairments were found which represent a subset of deficits reported in previous group and case study reports. Deficits were limited to complex visual memory, conceptual set shifting, and attention, which suggest a selective dysexecutive syndrome. The motor slowing and verbal memory deficits previously reported were not found. Although depression, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and pain were significant symptoms, they were unassociated with deficits {{with the exception of}} an association of depression with one deficit. There was no pattern of overall decline over time in a subset of the group, although considerable heterogeneity in the longitudinal patterns of neurocognitive tests was found. Abnormalities of white matter appeared in the MRI of eight of 12 patients.  CONCLUSIONS—The neurocognitive and neuroimaging findings contribute to the evidence which indicates that the neural substrate of EMS is white matter damage. ...|$|E
