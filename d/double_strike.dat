25|$|In 1993, {{during the}} Nagorno-Karabakh war, {{the city of}} Aghdam came under Armenian control, and the team was forced to move from Imarat Stadium to Baku, while the {{head coach of the}} team, Allahverdi Bagirov, died in the war. Financial {{problems}} plagued the club during the period from 1998–2001, and the club went through hard times although it became the first Azerbaijani team to win away from home in a European competition by defeating the Israeli side Maccabi Haifa 1-2 in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup thanks to a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> from club legend Mushfig Huseynov. Qarabağ has also represented Azerbaijan in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA cup many times.|$|E
25|$|The pre-match {{interest}} surrounded Brian Lara and {{his attempt}} to equal the first-class record of scoring six centuries in consecutive innings. After rain wiped out the first day Lara soon {{found himself in the}} middle as Middlesex chose to field first and Warwickshire lost an early wicket. He made 26 before edging a leg side delivery from Richard Johnson through to the wicket-keeper. The visitors were all out for 211, with no batsman passing fifty. Desmond Haynes was dismissed off the first ball of the reply but Middlesex lost no further wickets in the remainder of the day. Mike Roseberry and Mike Gatting, not out overnight, shared 77 for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed for 52. Roseberry also shared 79 with Mark Ramprakash (37) before going on to complete a 17th first-class century. He was ninth out as the middle and lower order offered little resistance and Middlesex's lead was restricted to 38. The deficit was turned into a lead by the close with Lara scoring a 52-ball half-century. He completed a sixth century in seven innings on the final morning, adding 85 from 84 balls, that quick scoring enabled a declaration leaving Middlesex a target of 269 from 50 overs. They began well, reaching 129/1 before Tim Munton took the wickets of Gatting and Ramprakash in consecutive deliveries followed by Roseberry in his next over. The chase continued but another <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> from Munton left Middlesex to settle for the draw.|$|E
500|$|England {{progressed to}} 1/52 in their run-chase before a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> by Toshack. Edrich and Washbrook fell in quick {{succession}} to leave England at 3/65. Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the slips and Tallon took a difficult catch to remove Washbrook. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking {{that he may have}} hit a bump ball into the ground before it flew to Johnson, but the umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out. Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as [...] "miraculous" [...] because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to complete the catch. English commentator John Arlott speculated that Edrich and Washbrook may have lost concentration after Lindwall was replaced by Toshack, lulled into {{a false sense of security}} once Australia's leading bowler was no longer operating. England then recovered to be 3/106 at stumps on the fourth day.|$|E

2500|$|On 13 February 1945, {{bad weather}} over Europe {{prevented}} any USAAF operations, {{and it was}} left to RAF Bomber Command to carry out the first raid. It had been decided that the raid would be a <b>double</b> <b>strike,</b> in which a second wave of bombers would attack three hours after the first, just as the rescue teams were trying to put out the fires. Other raids were carried out that night to confuse German air defences. Three hundred and sixty heavy bombers (Lancasters and Halifaxes) bombed a synthetic oil plant in Böhlen, [...] from Dresden, while de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers attacked Magdeburg, Bonn, Misburg near Hanover and Nuremberg.|$|E
2500|$|Spares {{and strikes}} are also marked uniquely in candlepins. Spares are {{recorded}} {{in a box}} by coloring in the left upper corner of the appropriate left-hand square (using a triangular shape to [...] "fill-in the corner"). If a strike is recorded, opposing corners of the left-hand square are similarly colored in, while leaving sufficient space between the [...] "filled-in" [...] opposing corners, to record the score from the two succeeding balls' [...] "fill" [...] total for the strike. A common (albeit unofficial) practice is to mark a strike on a strike's bonus ball (<b>double</b> <b>strike)</b> by shading in the remaining two corners of the first strike.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{international}} matches, South Africa led by three points {{before the final}} group stage match, but still needed at least a tie or a no-result to qualify. Sri Lanka batted first, and made nine for 257 after a century partnership between Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya, and Sri Lankan seamer Chaminda Vaas then took two South African wickets in the seventh over. Graeme Smith rebuilt with Mark Boucher (partnership of 58) and Ashwell Prince, but another <b>double</b> <b>strike,</b> this time from substitute Malinga Bandara set South Africa back to five for 114. Bandara took two more wickets, was named Man of the Match, and Cricinfo journalist Peter English described his performance as [...] "stunning" [...] South Africa were eventually all out for 181, with Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan and Tillakaratne Dilshan chipping in with a wicket each, and Sri Lanka qualified for the three-match final series.|$|E
2500|$|One {{scene in}} the 1981 film Chariots of Fire recreates a race in which the runners attempt to round the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge {{in the time it takes}} the clock to <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> the hour at midday or midnight. Many have tried to run the [...] around the court in the 43.6 seconds that it takes to strike 12 o'clock. Known as the Great Court Run, students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the evening of the matriculation dinner. The only persons recognised to have actually completed the run in time are David Cecil in 1927 and Sam Dobin in 2007. It was thought that Coe had succeeded when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988 in a time of 42.53 seconds. A video of the race, however, apparently shows that Coe was 12 metres short of the finish line when the last chime sounded, so Trinity College never officially accepted his time.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March, Queensland Bulls won {{the league}} stage {{and made sure}} the Pura Cup final would be held in Brisbane after beating Victoria by 106 runs [...] Jimmy Maher and Matthew Hayden opened by adding 153 for the first wicket, and despite seven for 100 from Shane Warne, Queensland totalled 408 after an unbeaten 76 from Andy Bichel. The Bushrangers barely made half of that, ending on 212 with Jonathan Moss top scoring with 60, and Queensland {{declared}} shortly before the close of play on day three on five for 189. All five Bulls' bowlers got at least one wicket on the final day, and though Nick Jewell and Cameron White put on 100 for the fifth wicket, a <b>double</b> <b>strike</b> from injured leg spinner Daniel Doran after tea saw the Bushrangers to seven for 239. Michael Kasprowicz and Andy Bichel took the last three wickets to give Queensland their eighth successive Pura Cup final appearance. Australia also came back to 1–2 in the five-match ODI series in South Africa, successfully defending 255 to win despite half-centuries from Shaun Pollock and AB de Villiers.

50|$|A {{variation}} of four-ball called desítkový karambol (Czech for 'tenfold carom') is popular in Central Europe, {{especially in the}} Czech Republic.

Players score a point by hitting on any other three balls with the cue ball, scoring one point for single or <b>double</b> <b>strikes.</b> A carom off all three object balls in one shot, however, scores 10 points. The score is doubled by hitting a cushion before hitting {{any of the other}} balls for a total of either 2 or 20 points in one shot.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{emergence}} and popularization of online auction {{sites such as}} eBay, misspelled auction searches have quickly become lucrative for people searching for deals. The concept on which these searches are based is that, if an individual posts an auction and misspells its description and/or title, regular searches will not find this auction. However, a search which includes misspelled alterations of the original search term {{in such a way}} as to create misspellings, transpositions, omissions, <b>double</b> <b>strikes,</b> and wrong key errors would find most misspelled auctions. The resulting effect is that there are far fewer bids than there would be under normal circumstances allowing for the searcher to obtain the item for less. A series of third-party web sites have sprung up allowing people to find these items.|$|R

40|$|A {{recently}} completed testing machine for dynamic tensile tests is described. The machine consists essentially of a pendulum which holds the specimen {{and a large}} steel disk with a <b>double</b> <b>striking</b> nose fixed to its circumference. Disk diameter measures 2000 mm, while its mass is 6400 kg. The specimens to be tested are tensile specimens with a diameter of {{up to 20 mm}} and 300 mm length or CT 15 specimens at various temperatures. Loading velocity ranges from 1 to 150 m/s. The process of specimen-nose coupling is only possible by use of a fast process computer controlling the machine via ultra-fast sensors. In addition to standard measuring techniques an image converter camera is used to register the deformation of the specimen during the impact event. The machine and various measuring and controlling devices are described and preliminary results are presented...|$|R
