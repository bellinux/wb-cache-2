25|$|The Great Falls {{themselves}} {{formed on}} a fall line unconformity in the Great Falls Tectonic Zone. The Missouri River {{settled into a}} bedrock canyon which lay beneath the clay laid down by Glacial Lake Great Falls. The course of the Missouri {{in and around the}} Great Falls has changed very little since then, in comparison to lower regions of the river on the <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> that forms much of the upper Great Plains.|$|E
2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the park, there are spread-out holes (kettle holes) created by small remains of ice age glaciers, and {{peculiar}} small hills called [...] "eskers" [...] made by <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> released by melting glaciers.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> {{landscape}} of the Uelzen Basin is predominantly used for agriculture. On the surrounding ridges {{there are also a}} few pine forests however. There are still large areas of heath here as well, for example the Ellerndorfer Heide ("Ellerndorf Heath") [...] in western Uelzen district or the Klein Bünstorfer Heide ("Klein Bünstorf Heath").|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>moraines</b> are till-covered {{areas with}} {{irregular}} topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains. They are accumulated {{at the base}} of the ice as lodgment till, but may also be deposited as the glacier retreats. In [...] glaciers, <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> are often found between the two lateral <b>moraines.</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>moraines</b> may be modified into drumlins by the overriding ice.|$|R

50|$|Till {{is derived}} from the erosion and {{entrainment}} of material by the moving ice of a glacier. It is deposited some distance down-ice to form terminal, lateral, medial and <b>ground</b> <b>moraines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Lying {{directly}} {{atop the}} Cretaceous rocks is till {{just a few}} thousand years old. [...] All intermediate rock had eroded away before the till was deposited in a <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> by continental glaciers. [...] Within Flandrau State Park this glacial debris is [...] thick. [...] While the till contains some rock from Canada and northern Minnesota, most is from the local region. [...] Numerous springs emerge {{at the base of}} the till slopes, especially at the western end of the park.|$|E
2500|$|The South Heath (Südheide) is {{dominated}} by expanses of gently undulating, hilly Sander plains, and sheets of <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> {{and the remains of}} end moraines from earlier ice ages. There are still large areas of heath on the military training areas near Bad Fallingbostel and Munster (Örtze); these are out-of-bounds to visitors however. The Osterheide near Schneverdingen also belongs to this natural subdivision. It is part of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve. Near Schneverdingen and south of Soltau there are several bogs. A large area of the [...] Südheide is covered by pine forests.|$|E

5000|$|Ice moves parent {{material}} and makes deposits {{in the form}} of terminal and lateral moraines in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.|$|R
50|$|The low {{mountain}} terrace {{is composed}} of <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> and gravels, probably from the Würm glaciation. In the south the terrace is bounded by the so-called Achberg range (Achbergzug), a chain of mountains made of main dolomite, {{the other side of}} which is the Inn valley.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} subsurface layers on Lüneburg Heath {{are almost}} exclusively {{made up of}} deposits from the quaternary ice age. The landscape consists of flat plains of <b>ground</b> <b>moraines,</b> ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited {{at the edge of}} the ice sheet.|$|R

50|$|Because Minnesota has had glacial {{movements}} {{into the}} state from both the northeast and northwest, the landscape has been modified by overlapping glacial regions. For example, an outwash plain from the Cary glacier may have a newer cover of <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> from the Mankato glacier, or a Cary <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> may have been subsequently covered over by Mankato outwash.|$|E
50|$|The Osterholz Geest is an undulating, sandy area of <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> {{between the}} city of Bremen and the towns of Bremerhaven and Bremervörde.|$|E
5000|$|The {{river channel}} was formed, like the {{surrounding}} landscape, in the penultimate ice age, the Saale glaciation. The ice sheets shaped the terrain over 100,000 {{years ago with}} their <b>ground</b> <b>moraines.</b> The streams acted as drainage channels for the higher lying areas of geest in the Aller glacial valley.|$|R
50|$|The {{key terrain}} feature of Northern Germany is the North German Plain {{including}} the marshes along the coastline of the North and Baltic Seas, {{as well as}} the geest and heaths inland. Also prominent are the low hills of the Baltic Uplands, the <b>ground</b> <b>moraines,</b> end moraines, sandur, glacial valleys, bogs and Luch.|$|R
50|$|A till plain is an {{extensive}} flat plain of glacial till that forms when {{a sheet of}} ice becomes detached from {{the main body of}} a glacier and melts in place, depositing the sediments it carried. <b>Ground</b> <b>moraines</b> are formed when the till melts out of the glacier in irregular heaps, forming rolling hills.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> {{landscape}} consists predominantly in flat {{to gently}} rolling terrain, {{on which the}} ice mass deposited till. Zungenbecken, where the scouring of material played a significant role, occur {{to a lesser extent}} and are an element of the <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> landscape in the Scandinavian glaciation region. Because the advancing ice sheet completely buried the landscape, ice age landforms and depositions are found over much of North Germany. Tunnel valleys, by contrast, are not commonly found in Northern Central Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Wasseramt district, on a <b>ground</b> <b>moraine.</b> The houses are scattered around the Chapel of St. Michael and stretch toward Etziken.|$|E
50|$|Almost all the {{landscape}} elements that originated during the Weichselian Glaciation {{in the state}} of Brandenburg are united within the Central Brandenburg Plateaux and Lowlands. These are dominated by <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> plateaux of varying extent alternating with wide lowlands. Adjacent to the Nauen and Teltow <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> plateaux in the north are the lowlands of Havel, Nuthe and Notte. They are followed by the regions of the Karow Plateau, the Lehnin Land and the heaths of Beelitz and Luckenwald. In the far south a broad urstromtal, the Baruth Valley.|$|E
50|$|Wide urstromtal {{lowlands}} {{characterize the}} countryside of the Havelland. Plateaux {{rise above the}} general level of the land like islands, mostely formed from Ice Age <b>ground</b> <b>moraines.</b> But end moraines from the Saale and Weichsel glaciations also occur. The former were overlain {{to a greater or}} lesser extent by the advancing Weichselian ice sheet.|$|R
50|$|The Alpine glaciers, {{that formed}} {{a network of}} ice streams during the high points of the ice ages, {{repeatedly}} flowed beyond the boundary of the Alps and advanced into the Alpine Foreland. There they formed vast foreland glaciers. In this Alpine Foreland glaciation, Penck {{identified a number of}} landforms: the <b>ground</b> <b>moraines,</b> the Zungenbecken, the terminal moraines and the gravel plains in front of them.|$|R
5000|$|The Burgdorf-Peine Geest (Burgdorf-Peiner Geest) is a geest landscape, {{dominated}} by end and <b>ground</b> <b>moraines,</b> between Hanover and Brunswick in North Germany, with {{an area of}} about 550 km2. Its natural borders are the Aller depression in the north, the Hildesheim Börde and, in places, the Mittelland Canal in the south the Oker valley {{in the east and}} the Hanoverian Moor Geest in the west.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of lakes {{in the world}} are kettle lakes produced by glacial activity. In Minnesota, the {{majority of}} kettles lakes reside in <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> and terminal moraine areas.|$|E
50|$|The North Shore Highlands {{therefore}} {{are composed}} of mafic outcroppings and volcanic ridges along the lakeshore overlain in places by a <b>ground</b> <b>moraine,</b> and an inland glacial moraine paralleling that shoreline.|$|E
5000|$|Hümmling {{district}} existed 1815 to 1932 and was {{a district}} {{in what is now}} western Lower Saxony, Germany.It was named after the Hümmling hills, a <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> landscape in Emsland region ...|$|E
50|$|The {{lake and}} its {{surrounding}} landscape were shaped by the Weichsel ice age. It {{is embedded in the}} <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> of Niederbarnimer. During the melting of the ice a huge block of ice remained; when it subsequently thawed it created what is known as a kettle hole. This was the origin of today's Weisser See. Over the centuries settlements developed around the lake, mainly based on agriculture; the oldest known settlement dates from the 13th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of tectonic activity is very {{evident in the}} area. There are many depressions, solution valleys, small karst poljes, {{and the remains of}} former river valleys. During the Pliocene the rivers leveled the tectonic upwelling and filled the valleys. Traces were also left by Pliocene glaciation because glaciers created small cirques on what had been a relatively level surface, as well as <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> and terminal moraines. The rivers transported gravel and deposited it in lower areas, filling the depressions.|$|R
50|$|Guben {{is located}} in the {{district}} (Landkreis) of Spree-Neiße in the southeast of the state of Brandenburg. It is in the historical region of Lower Lusatia. Guben's position {{on the banks of the}} Lusatian Neisse between two plateaus was advantageous in its early economic development. These plateaus developed from <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> of the Wisconsin glaciation period. Both the western (Kaltenborner Berge = Kaltenborn Hills) and eastern (Gubener Berge = Guben Hills) ended up as terminal moraines. The surrounding land is covered with pine forests and lakes.|$|R
50|$|The Hümmling (Homelinghen, from hömil = small stone) is a <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> landscape, up to , in the Emsland {{region on}} the North German Plain {{in the western}} part of the German state of Lower Saxony.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many parts}} of the park, there are spread-out holes (kettle holes) created by small remains of ice age glaciers, and {{peculiar}} small hills called [...] "eskers" [...] made by <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> released by melting glaciers.|$|E
50|$|These processes, {{combined}} with erosion and transport {{by the water}} network beneath the glacier, leave moraines, drumlins, <b>ground</b> <b>moraine</b> (till), kames, kame deltas, moulins, and glacial erratics in their wake, typically at the terminus or during glacier retreat.|$|E
50|$|The region {{lies between}} the moraines of the Frankfurt Series and the Pomeranian Stage of the Weichselian {{glaciation}} and was formed during that ice age about 12,000 {{years ago in}} the meltwater valleys and sandurs of the Pomeranian. It has relatively high levels of relief for Brandenburg. There are flat sandur areas, undulating <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> and elongated end moraines. In between them lie the tunnel valley lakes and kettle lakes. These lakes do not generally have natural surface head and tailwaters. They were later linked by canals.|$|R
50|$|The Bullenkuhle {{lies about}} 15 {{kilometres}} {{south of the}} town of Uelzen and a good kilometre west of the village of Bokel (in the municipality of Sprakensehl) {{at the edge of a}} large pine forest at a height of about 95 m above NN. A stream emerges in the immediate vicinity which is initially called the Bokeler Bach and, later, becomes the Aue and finally, after combining with other streams, becomes an Elbe tributary, the River Ilmenau. The area belongs to the southeast fringes of the Hohen Heide in the centre of the Lüneburg Heath. This landscape formed from end and <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> and periglacial sediments was created geomorphologically mainly by the edges of the ice sheet during the later phases of the Saalian glaciation, i.e. during the so-called Drenthe II stage and the final glacial advance of the Warthe stage. The crests of the undulating ridges of end moraines are usually covered with pine forests growing on sandy soils; the <b>ground</b> <b>moraines</b> were used for agriculture. The typical open heath landscape of the Lüneburg Heath - which arose anthropogenically through overexploitation of forests, burning, plaggen cutting and grazing - only exists today in fragments in the area around the Bullenkuhle. The macroclimate of the Lüneburg Heath is maritime temperate.|$|R
50|$|The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) {{is an area}} of the {{northern}} Great Plains and midgrass and tallgrass prairies that contains thousands of shallow wetlands known as potholes. These potholes are the result of glacier activity in the Wisconsin glaciation, which ended about 10,000 years ago. The decaying ice sheet left behind depressions formed by the uneven deposition of till in <b>ground</b> <b>moraines.</b> These depressions are called potholes, glacial potholes, kettles, or kettle lakes. They fill with water in the spring, creating wetlands which range in duration from temporary to semipermanent.|$|R
