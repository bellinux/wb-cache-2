His attempts to tell a bar joke come out as random gibberish. Gabe and Jim lead him out of the office after Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) calls for an ambulance.|$|E

In April 1985, Michaels {{went to work}} for another NWA {{territory in}} Kansas City called Central States Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Battens.|$|E
5|$|Its {{impedance}} is 1.8ohms at 20kHz, to over 60ohms at 150Hz, and its load {{is highly}} capacitive.

This is very demanding on amplifiers' stability.|$|E

5|$|On 29 October Banksy's art was {{displayed}} in a shop window, unbeknownst to the owners. Banksy had purchased a very basic painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} a Nazi in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view, and donated <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> store, drastically increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown Hoyas {{returned}} to the National Championship game in 1984, where they faced off against the Houston Cougars and won 8475. It was the first NCAA Men's Basketball National Championship that Georgetown had won, along with the first that Thompson had won as head coach. The following year, they again made <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national title game. This time, however, they lost to the number eight seeded Villanova Wildcats.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the House of Commons on {{division}} in June 2006. The Canadian Senate approved it in December 2006, with several amendments, and sent <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commons for further consideration.

5|$|When Hudson {{returned}} to Cleaveland, he found few settlers and no food to spare. He continued east on Lake Erie {{to the mouth}} of Cattaraugus Creek, a stream in Western New York. There, Hudson obtained food and brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> settlement.|$|E
5|$|Cleburne {{served at}} the Battle of Shiloh and the Battle of Richmond (Kentucky), where he {{was wounded in the}} face when a minie ball pierced his left cheek, smashed several teeth, and exited through his mouth, {{recovering}} in time to participate in the Battle of Perryville. After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and {{served at the}} Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nashville Pike and its final line of defense. He was promoted to major general on December 13.|$|E
5|$|His {{concern with}} public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid {{out a series of}} instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E

5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made {{a leisurely}} drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and {{included}} {{passage through the}} Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When they arrived in Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states {{at the end of}} his tour.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German military installations and troop movements and communicating <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied armies. The organization was run through {{a large number of}} independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E
5|$|Mark Gyrion, Daley's second cousin, was a {{superintendent}} of garages for the City's Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap. Gyrion's mother-in-law's firm, Jacz Transportation, {{participated in the}} Hired Truck Program, receiving about $1 million between 1998 and 2004. Jacz Transportation bought a truck {{three days after the}} city sold it to a Franklin Park dealership and then leased <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law's role in the Hired Truck Program and the transfer of the truck. Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from the Hired Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.|$|E

5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|One {{adviser to}} Khrushchev was Trofim Lysenko, who promised greatly {{increased}} production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. Lysenko managed {{to maintain his}} influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government, artificially increasing recorded production.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child's own experiences.|$|E

5|$|The Red Wings {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1984 where they suffered a first round defeat to the St. Louis Blues. In the 32 seasons since then they have made the playoffs 30 times, including 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 to 2016. They {{returned to}} the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1966 in 1995 where they were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four games. However, in 1997 they made <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Finals, winning the series in four straight games over the Philadelphia Flyers. They repeated as champions in the following season with a four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals. Their most recent championships were in 2002 and 2008, with their most recent Finals appearance in 2009 where they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins.|$|E
5|$|The first Dutch {{settlements}} in the New York area appeared around 1613. The English captured the New Netherland Colony from the Dutch in 1664, renaming it the Province of New York after the King's brother, the Duke of York (later King James II). The Dutch recaptured the colony in July 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but gave <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English under the Treaty of Westminster in exchange for Suriname. The Duke of York never governed the colony himself: he instead appointed governors, councils, and other officers to run the government. Richard Nicolls served as the first governor of New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor in the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E
