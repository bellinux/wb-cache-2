40|$|One of {{the first}} {{standards}} in the wireless sensor networks domain,WirelessHART (HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer)), was introduced to address industrial process automation and control requirements. This standard {{can be used as}} a reference point to evaluate other wireless protocols in the domain of industrial monitoring and control. This makes it worthwhile to set up a reliable WirelessHART simulator in order to achieve that reference point in a relatively easy manner. Moreover, it offers an alternative to expensive testbeds for testing and evaluating the performance of WirelessHART. This paper explains our implementation of WirelessHART in the NS- 2 network simulator. According to our knowledge, this is the first implementation that supports the WirelessHART network manager, as well as the whole stack (all OSI (Open Systems Interconnection model) layers) of the WirelessHART standard. It also explains our effort to validate the correctness of our implementation, namely through the validation of the implementation of the WirelessHART stack protocol and of the network manager. We use sniffed traffic from a realWirelessHART testbed installed in the Idrolab plant for these validations. This confirms the validity of our simulator. Empirical analysis shows that the simulated results are nearly comparable to the results obtained from real networks. We also demonstrate the versatility and usability of our implementation by providing some further evaluation results in diverse scenarios. For example, we evaluate the performance of the WirelessHART network by applying <b>incremental</b> <b>interference</b> in a multi-hop network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{supervised}} {{neural network}} training technique based on constrained optimization is developed for preserving {{prior knowledge of}} an input–output mapping during repeated incremental training sessions. The prior knowledge, referred to as long-term memory (LTM), is expressed {{in the form of}} equality constraints obtained by means of an algebraic training technique. Incremental training, which may be used to learn new short-term memories (STMs) online, is then formulated as an error minimization problem subject to equality constraints. The solution of this problem is simplified by implementing an adjoined error gradient that circumvents direct substitution and exploits classical backpropagation. A target application is neural network function approximation in adaptive critic designs. For illustrative purposes, constrained training is implemented to update an adaptive critic flight controller, while preserving prior knowledge of an established performance baseline that consists of classical gain-scheduled controllers. It is shown both analytically and numerically that the LTM is accurately preserved while the controller is repeatedly trained over time to assimilate new STMs. Index Terms—Adaptive critics, control, exploration, function approximation, <b>incremental</b> training, <b>interference,</b> knowledge acquisition and retention, memory, online learning, sigmoidal neural networks.

40|$|Abstract. The {{squeezing}} tool in 5 -axis CNC incremental forming {{has more}} {{degrees of freedom}} and can squeeze the sheet metal along the reasonable direction, thus better forming effect is obtained. While {{in the process of}} 5 -axis CNC <b>incremental</b> forming the <b>interference</b> between squeezing tool and workpiece occurs frequently because of the continual posture change of squeezing tool. Therefore the interference checking method of squeezing tool and workpiece is studied in this paper. The interference is checked out through the collision calculation of established squeezing tool solid models of different posture and workpiece solid model based on Parasolid modeling kernel. The case study shows that the method can check the interference between the squeezing tool and workpiece very well...|$|R
