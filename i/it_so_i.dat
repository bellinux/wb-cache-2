And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> had to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E

Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just {{had to come up with}} my own shit." [...] The album was produced by Rick Rubin and was recorded at Oceanway Studios.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, but I still tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd fuck with <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could make it my own." ...|$|E

I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try {{to include}} a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary {{composer}} for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater {{and he has the}} vocal instrument to go with <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." [...] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in [...] "Cape Feare".

500|$|American actor Kelsey Grammer {{was brought}} in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time. At that time, Grammer had become a {{household}} name as the lead of the television series Frasier, which was in production {{at the same time as}} this episode.

The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode.

[...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off.

[...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, and he told me how he was gonna shoot <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
