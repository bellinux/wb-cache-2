5|$|The Wild Bunch is a 1969 American epic Western film {{directed}} by Sam Peckinpah about an aging outlaw gang on the Texas–Mexico border, trying to exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> modern world of 1913. The film was controversial {{because of its}} graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.|$|E

The program was completed by 1963. The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the all-weather, low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission {{in the face of}} advancing Soviet missile-based air defenses.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> history of the organic world.|$|E

25|$|Diseases {{that can}} be {{transmitted}} by direct contact are called contagious (contagious {{is not the same}} as infectious; although all contagious diseases are infectious, not all infectious diseases are contagious). These diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel (where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies) or items of clothing in close contact with the body (socks, for example) if they are not washed thoroughly between uses. For this reason, contagious diseases often break out in schools, where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> rooms.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> {{atmosphere}} of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the importance of population control and family planning in the Third World for U.S. foreign policy was being stressed, AVS became in 1972 {{for the first time}} the recipient of funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In its subsequent international activities, AVS became instrumental in the widespread acceptance and utilization of surgical sterilization. It is in large part due to its pioneering work that this is the most prevalent method of contraception worldwide.|$|E

25|$|The viable {{system model}} (VSM) {{is a model}} of the {{organisational}} structure of any autonomous system capable of producing itself. A viable system is any system organised {{in such a way as}} to meet the demands of surviving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic (regulation theory) description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.|$|E

They became a center of interest to northerners vacationing in St. Augustine, who included teachers and missionaries. Pratt recruited volunteers to teach the Indian prisoners English, the Christian religion, and elements of American culture. He and most US officials believed that such assimilation was needed for the Indians' survival <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> society.|$|E

25|$|Harriott's free-form {{compositions}} normally formed only {{a portion}} of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's High Spirits (Columbia), was a straight-ahead jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the Noël Coward play Blithe Spirit. However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to free form, and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{evidence}} currently {{suggests that}} the point of biogeographical origin for the thrips is in Southeast Asia or on the Indian subcontinent, the original host remains unknown. Chili peppers did not arrive in India until {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries with Portuguese traders, so the host upon which S. dorsalis was first described cannot be the point of origin. Given S. dorsalis’ broad polyphagy and long history of pestilent behavior, it has been speculated that a weed such as castor that was adopted for agriculture may have been one of several hosts of origin, and that the thrips adapted and began to exploit other hosts as they became available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> agricultural landscape.|$|E
25|$|Wessels {{decided to}} switch to cricket, even though the rules of Grey College did not allow him to play {{at such a young}} age. With the help of Johan Volsteedt (who was the first team captain), Wessels was allowed to {{participate}} in the net practices and soon cricket became his main activity during summer. During winter, he played tennis, at which he won so frequently that, by 1973, he was the number 1 under-16 player in South Africa and was offered a scholarship of $25 000 over four years from the University of Houston. However, {{due to the fact that}} he played as an under-16 against adults, Wessels began to lose regularly in senior tournaments. After a dramatic loss during the Griqualand West Open in Kimberley – after which he cut all the strings from his racket <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> room – Wessels turned down the offer from Houston and decided to focus all his attention on cricket.|$|E
