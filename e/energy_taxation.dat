5000|$|In Sweden, {{there are}} so far three {{different}} taxes levied on energy products (mainly fossil fuels), namely energy tax, sulphur tax and [...] tax. <b>Energy</b> <b>taxation</b> {{has been used as}} a policy instrument ever since the oil crisis of the 1970s to support renewable energy and nuclear power.

50|$|Finland was {{the first}} country in the 1990s to {{introduce}} a CO2 tax, initially with few exemptions for specific fuels or sectors. Since then, however, <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> has been changed many times and substantially. These changes {{were related to the}} opening of the Nordic electricity market. Other Nordic countries exempted energy-intensive industries, and Finnish industries felt disadvantaged by this. Finland did place a border tax on imported electricity, but this was found to be out of line with EU single market legislation. Changes were then made to the carbon tax to partially exclude energy-intensive firms. This had the effect of increasing the costs of reducing CO2 emissions (p. 16).|$|E

50|$|Czech Republic’s current {{tax system}} {{was put into}} {{administration}} on 1 January 1993.

In 2008, the administration also introduced <b>Energy</b> <b>Taxation.</b> Changes to tax laws are quite frequent and common in the Czech Republic due to a dynamic economy. Highest levels of revenue are generated from income tax, social security contributions, value-added tax and the corporate tax. In 2015, total revenue stood at CZK 670.216 billion which was 36.3% of GDP. The tax quota of the Czech Republic {{is lower than the}} EU average.|$|E

40|$|Environmental and <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> are {{essential}} components for designing global economic policies {{and they often}} contribute to achieving the sustainable economic development goals in contemporary economies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{whether or not}} the imposition of a common EC energy-tax will penalize more the poorer Southern European economies and if this will harm convergence at the EC level. We start by surveying briefly the existing studies and empirical evidence. Then we exploit the results obtained when using the macroeconometric HERMES models to simulate the introduction of an energy-tax. Unfortunately, as we only have HERMES results for one Southern European economy, Portugal, our conclusions are limited. Finally, we investigate convergence in Europe and the effects of <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> on convergence. We conclude that <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> will harm growth all over the EC, penalizing more one of the less developed countries, Portugal, and having most probably adverse effects on convergence.

40|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have been a {{detailed}} evaluation of the economic implications of <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> as a policy instrument to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. However, {{little attention has been}} devoted to inquiring about the economic implications of <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> in the newly industrialized countries (the so-called NICs). In this paper, we use a multisector, multihousehold computable general equilibrium model to assess the distributional effects of alternative <b>energy</b> <b>taxation</b> on the Taiwan economy. The counterfactual simulation technique is applied to investigate the income distribution implications of: (1) an increase in the import taxes of crude oil; and (2) an increase in the excise taxes of petroleum products. Our empirical results basing on Taiwan's data show that both energy taxes increase government revenue and the Gini coefficient, but reduce net value-added, private consumption, disposable income and equivalent variation. A raise in the Gini coefficient implies that there is a worsening in the distribution of income. The lowest income group suffers relatively large welfare and income loss, but the highest income group suffers a relatively small welfare and income loss. The distributional effects differ from household to household depending on the composition of their total consumption and the source of their factor income. Our findings reveal that the energy tax appears to be mildly regressive, there are broadly consistent with those cases of developed countries reported in previous studies. ...|$|E
