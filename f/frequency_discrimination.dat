Localization of the target in orthogonal directions (up vs. down or front vs. back, independent of target side) was faster when cue and target appeared on the same rather than opposite sides. This benefit was larger and more durable when the cue predicted target side. These effects cannot reflect criterion shifts, suggesting that covert orienting enhances auditory localization.

In earlier publications, {{we proposed a}} model of this type to account for masking effects found with spatial <b>frequency</b> and orientation <b>discriminations.</b> Our model includes two nonlinear mechanisms that regulate contrast sensitivity in early cortical mechanisms. The first is a local within-pathway nonlinearity that accelerates at low contrasts but is compressive at high. The second is a pooled nonlinear gain control process that operates over {{a broad range of}} neurons with different tuning characteristics. Here, we test predictions of the model for spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminations.</b> The model predicts that at low contrasts, adding a grating mask oriented parallel to test gratings will improve discrimination performance via operation of the within-pathway nonlinearity, analogous to the “dipper effect” found with contrast discriminations. Adding an orthogonally oriented mask is predicted to have no effect at low contrasts, where pooled gain control processes contribute little to performance. At high contrasts, the model predicts that performance will asymptote and become independent of contrast with either parallel or orthogonal masks. The results confirm model predictions...|$|R

Amplitude ratios of regional phases comprised mainly of P-wave energy (Pn, Pg) to those comprised mainly of S-wave energy (Sn, Lg) effectively discriminate between explosions and earthquakes in many regions, particularly at frequencies higher than 3 Hz. At lower <b>frequencies,</b> <b>discrimination</b> is usually poor due to large scatter that causes overlapping of event populations. Scatter in regional discriminant measures such as Pg/Lg ratios is caused by both source and propagation effects, and reducing the scatter imparted by the latter is essential to improving the discriminant performance when events do not share identical paths. Regional phases experience distance-dependent amplitude variations due to effects uch as critical angle ampli-fication, geometric spreading, and attenuation. Discriminant measures are usually corrected for empirically determined distance trends for a given region, but large scatter persists after such corrections. This study seeks to develop more sophisticated empirical corrections for path properties in order to further reduce the scatter i...|$|R

High spatial frequencies represent abrupt spatial changes in the image, such as edges, and generally correspond to featural information and fine detail. M.

40|$|An 11 -yr-old {{girl had}} {{an absence of}} sensory {{components}} of auditory evoked potentials (brainstem, middle and long-latency) to click and tone burst stimuli that she could clearly hear. Psychoacoustic tests revealed a marked impairment of those auditory perceptions dependent on temporal cues, that is, lateralization of binaural clicks, change of binaural masked threshold with changes in signal phase, binaural beats, detection of paired monaural clicks, monaural detection of a silent gap in a sound, and monaural threshold elevation for short duration tones. In contrast, auditory functions reflecting intensity or <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminations</b> (difference limens) were only minimally impaired. Pure tone audiometry showed a moderate (50 dB) bilateral hearing loss with a disproportionate severe loss of word intelligibility. Those auditory evoked potentials that were preserved included (1) cochlear microphonics reflecting hair cell activity; (2) cortical sustained potentials reflecting processing of slowly changing signals; and (3) long-latency cognitive components (P 300, processing negativity) reflecting endogenous auditory cognitive processes. Both the evoked potential and perceptual deficits are attributed to changes in temporal encoding of acoustic signals perhaps occurring at the synapse between hair cell and eighth nerve dendrites.

50|$|Congenital {{deafness}} or {{sensorineural hearing}} loss is an often used model {{for the study of}} the inner ear regarding pitch perception and theories of hearing in general. Frequency analysis of these individuals’ hearing has given insight on common deviations from normal tuning curves, excitation patterns, and <b>frequency</b> <b>discrimination</b> ranges. By applying pure or complex tones, information on pitch perception can be obtained. In 1983, it was shown that subjects with low frequency {{sensorineural hearing loss}} demonstrated abnormal psychophysical tuning curves. Changes in the spatial responses in these subjects showed similar pitch judgment abilities when compared to subjects with normal spatial responses. This was especially true regarding low frequency stimuli. These results suggest that the place theory of hearing does not explain pitch perception at low frequencies, but that the temporal (frequency) theory is more likely. This conclusion is due to the finding that when deprived of basilar membrane place information, these patients still demonstrated normal pitch perception. Computer models for pitch perception and loudness perception are often used during hearing studies on acoustically impaired subjects. The combination of this modeling and knowledge of natural hearing allows for better development of hearing aids.|$|E

The research perhaps most {{relevant to this}} thesis has been performed by Scharf and his colleagues. In 1993, Scharf et al. presented data from eight patients who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy to treat Ménière’s disease, a procedure which severs the OCB (presumably both the MOCS and the LOCS). Scharf et al. (1993) {{did not find any}} clear differences in subjects’ thresholds to tones in noise before and after surgery. Shortly after this finding, Scharf et al. (1994, 1997) performed a comprehensive set of psychophysical experiments from a total of sixteen patients who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy (including the original eight subjects). [...] They measured performance in the psychophysical listening tasks before and after surgery, and found no significant difference in performance for (i) detection of tones, (ii) intensity discrimination of tones, (iii) <b>frequency</b> <b>discrimination</b> of tones, (iv) loudness adaptation, and (v) detection of tones in notched-noise. Their only positive finding was that most patients detected unexpected sounds in the operated ear better than in the healthy ear, or the same ear before surgery. This result was obtained using a truncated probe-signal procedure which led the patient to expect a certain frequency on each trial. Twelve subjects completed this experiment. Their procedure was similar to that of Greenberg and Larkin (1968), except only 50% of trials (not 77%) contained a target whose frequency matched that of the auditory cue. The other 50% of trials containing a probe whose frequency differed from that of the cue. Also, only two probe frequencies were used, one whose frequency was higher than the target, and one whose frequency was lower than the target. All trials contained an auditory cue (at the target frequency) prior to the first observation interval. The results were used to construct a basic attentional filter, which displayed detection level of the expected (and cued) target frequency and the two unexpected probe frequencies. From the two published reports (Scharf et al., 1994, 1997), ears for which the OCB has been lesioned showed an attentional filter with an average depth of about 15%-correct less than those ears for which the OCB was intact. Although {{there is no way to}} empirically convert this value to dB, a rough estimate based on psychometric functions presented by Green and Swets (1966) yields a value of 2-3 dB.

Rather, color vision allows one to use information about stimulus spectral parameters to determine other interesting and relevant object characteristics.

The well-known differences in the spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity functions for color and luminance and the apparently impoverished input from the color mechanisms to certain higher functions obscure the fact that spatial discriminations based solely upon color differences are quite good. For example, spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>discriminations</b> between high-contrast patterns at isoluminance are only slightly poorer than for comparable luminance patterns. averaging about 5 - 6 % of the base frequency.

During the following 15 days of training, there was only a minor improvement in tactile <b>frequency</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Retention of improved performance in <b>frequency</b> <b>discrimination</b> 30 days after training was demonstrated for all digits. Cortical finger representation in the primary somatosensory cortex, as measured by magnetic source imaging, did not change during training.
