5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|James Garfield {{was born}} the {{youngest}} of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio. Orange Township {{had been in the}} Western Reserve until 1800, and like many who settled there, Garfield's ancestors were from New England, his ancestor, Edward Garfield immigrating from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts in around 1630. James' father Abram had been born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> brother, dead in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E

In addition, by 1849, another gunpowder magazine, {{referred to as}} the Paiol Novo, was constructed.

This deficit {{can be explained by}} the inefficient processing in the medial-temporal regions. This region is important in episodic memory, which is one of the two types of long-term human memory, and it contains the hippocampi, which are crucial in creating memorial association between items.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} set in the present on the campus of a {{university}} in fictional Churchton, Illinois, modeled on Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where Bertram Cope, an attractive young English instructor, is spending a year completing his thesis. While he has a certain sophistication, he is socially unaware, easily impressed by the wealthy and their comforts. Lacking confidence, Cope is too careful and self-conscious as he tries to find his place in local society. Cope becomes the elusive object of desire, either social or sexual or some combination of the two, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> woman, two older men, and three young women. Cope's primary emotional attachment is to his college chum Arthur Lemoyne, who comes to live with him. Their relationship appears to end after Lemoyne, acting the female part in a play, makes a physical advance backstage that offends another male student.|$|E

Conway, a comic veteran, is known for his work on The Carol Burnett Show, which has a similar format to The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour.

500|$|During {{production}} of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight. NBC thought the cast was too young and pushed <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> character who could give the young adults advice. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured [...] "Pat the Cop." [...] Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, [...] "You know the kids book, Pat the Bunny? We had Pat the Cop." [...] NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.|$|E
500|$|Robotomy premiered on October 25, 2010 on Cartoon Network, {{following}} a new episode of Mad.

[...] The debut broadcast was seen by 1.7 million viewers in the United States, acquiring a 0.2 Nielsen rating for adults aged 18 to 49. The season received an average of 1.5 million viewers, also with a Nielsen rating of 0.2. After ten episodes, the series concluded on January 24, 2011, making it the shortest run of any original series on the network.|$|E

500|$|The chancel and {{the south}} chapel are each {{separated}} from the nave by arches; the chancel arch, which was added by Kennedy in 1882, is decorated with carvings of an eagle {{on one side and}} a lamb on the other. Steps lead up from the nave to the chancel, with a further step marking the sanctuary. [...] The east window dates from the late 14th or the early 15th century, although it has been rebuilt, with three lights (vertical sections separated by mullions). These are topped with tracery (decorative stone work) and cinquefoils (a five leaf pattern). It contains stained glass depicting St Mary and St John, added in 1890. The east window in the chapel is of similar design to the 17th-century window in the north wall of the nave, and dates from the late 16th or early 17th century; restoration work has been carried out on it. The south window has a pointed arch with two lights topped by cinquefoils; it is above a sill <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> window. There is also a window in the west wall of the chapel.|$|E
500|$|The {{combat and}} action {{elements}} of Nier {{were inspired by}} the God of War series of games, which both Taro and Saito enjoyed. While the games had not been as popular in Japan as in North America, the two felt {{that the idea of}} having boss fights with different combat styles than the regular battles was an idea that would appeal to players in both regions. The changing styles, as well as the occasional changes in camera angle and movement, were meant to [...] "accentuate [...] gap between real, modern scenery and the fantasy world" [...] as a tie-in to the game's story. The game was meant to appeal to older players; it was intended as an action-RPG <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> market than Square Enix's action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts. This influenced the decision to have a main character in his 30s, as well as more blood and swearing than typical in a Square Enix RPG. The fusion of different gameplay styles was included as a homage to earlier gameplay styles and genres.|$|E
500|$|Historian Allan Nevins, in his {{foreword}} to Walters' {{biography of}} Foraker, suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency, {{as he had}} hoped, because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians. While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate, had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it, having [...] "stood aside <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> man year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders. [...] First McKinley, with Hanna at his side, was given precedence; then Taft, whom Foraker had given a start in public life, scaled the peak. [...] Foraker, for all his administrative capacity, his wide popular appeal, and his unflinching courage, had the tragic lot of seeing a succession of associates go above him." [...] Even Foraker's final defeat, in 1914, proved {{to be part of}} the political rise of another president from Ohio, Harding. Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker's political style, and commented, [...] "How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune and how much to some of his traits, readers … may judge for themselves." [...] Cincinnati editor Murat Halstead, a contemporary, attributed the fact that Foraker did not get nominated in 1888 to the surplus of ambitious Ohio men at the convention: [...] in addition to Sherman, Foraker, and McKinley, even Harrison had been born in Ohio.|$|E

500|$|A {{pre-season}} injury {{kept him}} out of the entire 1980–81 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre-back. Smith returned from injury in 1981–82, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were sitting in 18th-place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one-month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 3–1 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 4–2 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence; he commented that [...] "They had been crying out <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> head like me". He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re-established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he would have stayed, but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre-back.|$|E
500|$|While critics {{had mixed}} {{reactions}} to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's [...] "clean bright visual look" [...] and the [...] "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this {{to the work of}} Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, [...] "The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself {{as one of the great}} animated action sequences." [...] In The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film, calling it [...] "a monumental treat", and stated, [...] "Atlantis is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." [...] Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, [...] "On the whole, Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division." [...] Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote positively of the film's approach <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> audience: [...] "But just beneath the surface, Atlantis brims with adult possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sega Genesis {{has often}} been {{considered}} among the best video game consoles ever produced. In 2009, IGN named it the fifth best video game console, citing its edge in sports games and better home version of Mortal Kombat, and lauding [...] "what some {{consider to be the}} greatest controller ever created: the six button." [...] In 2007, GameTrailers named the Sega Genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that [...] "left their mark on the history of gaming," [...] noting its great games and solid controller, and writing of the [...] "glory days" [...] of Sonic the Hedgehog. In January 2008, technology columnist Don Reisinger proclaimed that the Sega Genesis [...] "created the industry's best console war to date," [...] citing Sonic the Hedgehog, superior sports games, and backward compatibility with the Sega Master System. GamingExcellence also gave the Sega Genesis sixth place in 2008, declaring [...] "one can truly see the Genesis for the gaming milestone it was." [...] At the same time, GameDaily rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games. In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish wrote that [...] "If the Atari generation introduced video games as a short-lived '70s fad... and the NES generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young, Sega's Genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form", expounding that the system served as [...] "the key incubator for modern sports franchises", made [...] "consoles truly international" [...] by providing Western third-parties previously put at a disadvantage by Nintendo's restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative, created [...] "an online subscription service" [...] that foreshadowed [...] "PlayStation Plus more than 15 years early" [...] with the Sega Channel, and [...] "played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking Nintendo's near-monopolistic hold on the U.S. and awakening the U.K. to the merits of television gaming." [...] For his part, Kalinske highlighted Sega's role in developing games <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> demographic and pioneering [...] "the concept of the 'street date'" [...] with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. John Sczepaniak of Retro Gamer noted [...] "It was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games, but the magazines, playground arguments, climate, and politics of the time." ...|$|E
