5000|$|Ben Mrad, a book entitled: Mourning Haddad's Women (الحداد على امرأة الحداد), was {{published}} in 193, where he rejects the ideas of Tahar Haddad on the Status of Women in Tunisia, based on the scriptural texts of the Koran. The book follows an outcry from scholars of the court of Sharia {{and much of the}} population were in favor of the new ideas of Haddad. He defends the idea of wearing [...] "sefseri" [...] by Tunisian women which he finds is not a sign of religious identification, but a more traditional dress akin to a national uniform that was shared by all social groups. He also rejects the idea that social reforms can be accomplished without the time necessary for their understanding and assimilation by a colonized population still largely illiterate. According to him, the emancipation of Tunisian women must come first through instruction and education [...] He acknowledged however that some ideas of Haddad are not opposed to the Sharia on the Status of Women. This was done in the journal that he founded in 1937 - <b>Shams</b> <b>al-Islam</b> (The sun of Islam).|$|R

50|$|Khwaja Qamaruddin Sialvi {{was born}} on 24 Jumada al-awwal 1324 A.H. (7 July 1906), in Sial Sharif in the Punjab Province of British India. He was the eldest son of Hazrat Zia-ud-din Sialvi. He was {{familiar}} with the Quran by the age of nine. He received his religious education at several institutions, including ones in Mecca and Ajmer.When his age was four years, four months and ten days, Khawaja Diya' al-Din enrolled him to memorise the Qur'an in the class of Hafiz Karim Bakhsh. He very quickly memorised the Qur'an in a short span of time. Following that, capable teachers taught him Persian and Arabic etymology and syntax with much joy and hardwork and this capable student accepted all that he was taught with much joy and enthusiasm. When he was very young and was reading the Kanz al-Daqa'iq, during this time he wrote a commentary on a difficult issue within the Kanz al-Daqa'iq in the Arabic language. After seeing it, great learned scholars were left amazed. This written piece caused a greater sense of enhancing the education and upbringing of this student in the heart of his father; Khawaja Diya' al-Din. As a result, he looked towards a distinguished scholar from the Khayr Abadi family of knowledge and wisdom, Maulana Mu'in al-Din Ajmayri. At that time, he was the principal teacher at Madrasa 'Uthmaniyya Dar al-Khayr in Ajmayr (India) and so for some time, Khawaja Diya' al-Din sent his beloved son to Ajmayr in pursuit of education. Later on, Maulana Ajmayri was brought from Ajmayr to Siyal and Khawaja Qamar al-Din continued acquiring knowledge from him. A student of Maulana Ajmayri, Maulana Muhammad Husayn, also began teaching in Siyal at Dar al-'Ulum Diya' <b>Shams</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> Khawaja Qamar al-Din studied philosophy and logic with one of the leading masters of the Khayarabadi tradition, Maulana Muhammad Din Budhwi, who was considered unparalleled in his age in the rational sciences as well as in many other subjects. Khawaja Qamar al-Din completed these various sciences and disciplines from these learned scholars. He also completed the Dawra Hadith with Maulana Ajmayri, who consequently bestowed the sanad and ijaza of hadith narration to him.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 March 2014, Kessab and its {{surrounding}} villages saw a multi-pronged attack by forces opposed to the Syrian government. It was reported that the attackers, members of the al-Nusra Front, <b>Sham</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> and Ansar al-Sham, advanced directly from Turkish territory, were being supported by the Turkish military, and that injured rebel fighters were being sent to medical centres in Turkey. Some Kessab village guards reported that the Turkish military withdrew from its positions along the border shortly before the fighters crossed from Turkey. Mehmet Ali Ediboğlu, MP of Turkish CHP party, who visited the area several days after the attack began, said that villagers on the Turkish side of the border told him that [...] "thousands of fighters coming from Turkey crossed the border at at least five different points to launch the attack on Kassab". The fighters reportedly crossed into Syria from the village of Gözlekçiler, close to the border. Journalists were barred from visiting Gözlekçiler. Ediboğlu was also barred from approaching the border by Turkish soldiers but wrote of seeing [...] "dozens of Syrian-plated cars nonstop transporting terrorists from the military road between Gözlekçiler village and our military base at Kayapinar." [...] The civilian populations of Kessab and its surrounding villages either fled or were evacuated, with most seeking safety in Latakia, and Kessab is currently under the control of rebel groups. On 23 March, Turkish fighter jets shot down a Syrian fighter jet over Kessab that had been flying a support mission to assist Syrian army ground forces. The fighter crashed into Kessab. Turkey claimed that the jet had violated Turkish airspace, while Syria denied this. Turkish MP and CHP Party opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu claimed that the Syrian jet was a reconnaissance plane and that its downing was part of a government scheme to provoke war with Syria to divert attention from corruption scandals enveloping Turkey's president Erdogan and his party. Journalist Amberin Zaman wrote that leaked tapes in which Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, is heard discussing ways to spark a war with Syria might vindicate Kilicdaroglu's claims.On 2 April, during a hearing before the House State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee and {{in response to a question}} by Congressman Schiff, US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, said that Kessab [...] "is an issue of huge concern". Congressman Schiff noted that many of the residents were descendants of victims of the Armenian Genocide and that [...] "there is a particular poignancy to their being targeted in this manner." [...] On 3 April Armenia's Minister of Diaspora Hranush Hakobyan said that 38 of Kessab's Armenian inhabitants had been captured when the town fell to the rebels, 24 of them were later released, 3 had been forcefully taken into Turkey and were now in the village of Vaqif, and that 670 Armenian familieshad been displaced after the attack on Kessab, with about 400 of the families now in Latakia. The minister also said that in Kessab Armenian churches had been defaced, crosses on the churches had been removed, and property looted. Also on 3 April, Ruben Melkonyan, deputy dean of the Oriental Studies department at Yerevan State University, said that the Armenian community of Kessab was unlikely to recover and that what had happened were [...] "crimes that make a genocide".|$|R
