40|$|A {{study of}} the 7 Li(9 Be, 4 He 9 Be) 3 H {{reaction}} at E{beam}= 70 MeV has been performed using resonant particle spectroscopy techniques and provides a measurement of alpha-decaying states in 13 C. Excited states are observed at 12. 0, 13. 4, 14. 1, 14. 6, 15. 2, 16. 8, 17. 9, 18. 7, 21. 3 and 23. 9 MeV. This study provides the first measurement of the three <b>highest</b> <b>energy</b> <b>states.</b> Angular distribution measurements have been performed and have been employed to indicate the transferred angular momentum for the populated states.

40|$|We {{consider}} a hypothetical bound state of two electrons {{even if we}} leave the binding mechanism unknown. The bound electron pairs should behave as bosons and we conclude that the paired electrons are 'apparently' in the <b>highest</b> <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> of all the occupied states.

Moreover the Bose-Einstein condensation {{is known to be}} closely related to the critical temperatures of high Tc superconductors, which is consistent with our model. Most notably the model may describe a superconductor either with or without a Fermi surface. We propose two experimental methods to detect a bound electron pair, low energy electron-electron scattering and photoemission from high Tc superconductors. Comment: 18 pages. The possibility that the excess energy might be negative has been additionally discussed. Detection of bound pair by photoemission has been rewritten with the diverse possibilities being considered.
