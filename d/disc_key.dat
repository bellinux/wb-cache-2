40|$|Aims. We aim to {{understand}} the real nature of the stellar overdensity at southern galactic latitudes {{in the region of}} CMa. Methods. We perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presented in the literature which interpret the CMa overdensity as the signature of an accreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the Galaxy. Several issues are addressed. Results. We show that arguments against the “warp ” interpretation are based on an erroneous perception of the Milky Way. There is nothing anomalous with colour–magnitude diagrams {{on opposite sides of the}} average warp mid-plane being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population, first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded as a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer thin+thick disc metallicities being low (− 1 <[Fe/H]<− 0. 5), and spiral arms (as part of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show unambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa. Conclusions. The CMa over-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic models without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning the properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and degeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to support the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within the Milky Way <b>disc.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|Abstract. We {{include the}} tidal {{instability}} {{due to the}} 3 : 1 resonance in the disc instability model developed by Hameury et al. (1998) and modified by Buat-Ménard et al. (2001). We confirm earlier results by Osaki (1989) that the tidal instability can account for the SU UMa light curves. We show that in ultra-low mass ratio systems such as ER UMa stars and WZ Sge stars, the superoutburst ends while the disc is still eccentric, as proposed by Hellier (2001). However, since the disc shrinks rapidly once a cooling wave has started, the eccentricity should stop shortly {{after the end of}} a superoutburst. This result disagrees with the suggestion by Hellier that decoupling the thermal and tidal instability in the TTI model can account for late superhumps and echo outbursts in ultra-low mass ratio systems. We propose instead that ER UMa short supercycles can be explained either by the alternation of narrow and wide outbursts similar to those occurring in SS Cyg, or by the effects of irradiation (Hameury et al. 2000). In both cases, we predict that superhumps should be permanent, which is suggested by observations (Gao et al. 1999). We can also reproduce light curves similar to those of EG Cnc, varying the mass transfer rate in a TTI model including both irradiation and the presence of an inner hole in the <b>disc.</b> <b>Key</b> words: accretion, accretion discs – instabilities – (Stars:) novae, cataclysmic variables – (stars:) binaries: close A&A manuscript no.

40|$|We have re-analyzed archival Ginga data of {{the soft}} X–ray {{transient}} source GS 2023 + 308 (V 404 Cyg) covering the decline phase of its May 1989 outburst. Our spectral modeling includes the relativistically smeared Compton reflected continuum and iron Kα fluorescent line near 6. 5 keV produced by X–ray illumination of the accretion disc. This gives a powerful diagnostic of the accretion geometry, with the amplitude of the reprocessed components showing the solid angle subtended by the disc, while the detailed shape of the relativistic smearing shows how close this material is to the black hole event horizon. We find that reflection is always significantly present in the spectra, but that its fractional contribution decreases as the decline progresses. The amount of relativistic smearing {{is also consistent with}} decreasing during the decline, although this is poorly constrained except for the brightest spectra. One plausible scenario explaining this evolution is of an optically thick disc with inner radius increasing as a function of time, with the X–ray source {{in the form of a}} central corona. This is similar to the evolution inferred for other X–ray transient sources, such as Nova Muscae, except that the underlying power law spectrum of GS 2023 + 338 stayed constant as the disc geometry changed.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{instability}} {{mechanism is}} described in accretion flows where the gas is accelerated from a stationary shock to a sonic surface. The instability {{is based on a}} cycle of acoustic and entropic waves in this subsonic region of the flow. When advected adiabatically inward, entropy perturbations trigger acoustic waves propagating outward. If a shock is present at the outer boundary, acoustic waves reaching the shock produce new entropy perturbations, thus creating an entropic-acoustic cycle between the shock and the sonic surface. The interplay of acoustic and entropy perturbations is estimated analytically using a simplified model based on the compact nozzle approximation. According to this model, the entropic-acoustic cycle is unstable if the sound speed at the sonic surface significantly exceeds the sound speed immediately after the shock. The growth rate scales like the inverse of the advection time from the outer shock to the sonic point. The frequency of the most unstable perturbations is comparable to the refraction cutoff, defined as the frequency below which acoustic waves propagating inward are significantly refracted outward. This generic mechanism should occur in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, and also in shocked accretion <b>discs.</b> <b>Key</b> words: accretion, accretion disks – hydrodynamics – instabilities – shock waves – stars: binaries: close – X-rays: star...|$|R

This should for example apply to accretion disks around black holes, where X is relative accretion rate, or external heating rate, but will not apply to changes in black hole mass. I summarise evidence that AGN optical-UV SEDs become progressively redder with decreasing luminosity, and {{show that the}} trend in colour versus luminosity shown by Mushotzky and Wandel (1989) is matched extremely well by taking a template high-luminosity SED and scaling it in the manner described above. This agreement is striking because it involves no adjustable parameters. The agreement breaks down at low luminosities because of stellar contamination and reddening. I then consider the colour changes of an individual AGN (NGC 5548) during luminosity changes, which according to the popular X-ray reprocessing model, should follow the scaling law well. However the observed changes are clearly not consistent with the simple scaling prediction. Instead, these colour changes are quite well explained by the mixing of a constant red component and variable blue component. Overall, there is then strong support for the ideas (i) that AGN optical-UV SEDs arise from accretion discs, (ii) that accretion rate plays {{a significant role in the}} very large range of luminosity seen in AGN, and (ii) that the inner regions of AGN vary independently of the outer accretion <b>disc.</b> <b>Key</b> words: galaxies:active – galaxies:quasars:general – accretion – accretion discs. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many 3 D N-body barred {{models of}} the Galaxy {{extending}} beyond the Solar circle are realised by self-consistent evolution of various bar unstable axisymmetric models. The COBE/DIRBE K-band map, corrected for extinction, is used to constrain {{the location of the}} observer in these models, assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio. The resulting view points in the best matching models suggest that the inclination angle of the Galactic bar relative to the Sun-Galactic centre line is 28 ◦ ± 7 ◦. Scaling the masses according to the observed radial velocity dispersion of M giants in Baade’s Window, several models reproduce satisfactorily the kinematics of disc and halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood, as well as the disc local surface density and scale parameters. These models have a face-on bar axis ratio b/a = 0. 5 ± 0. 1 and a bar pattern speed ΩP = 50 ± 5 km/s/kpc, corresponding to a corotation radius of 4. 3 ± 0. 5 kpc. The HI terminal velocity constraints favour models with low disc mass fraction near the centre. The large microlensing optical depths observed towards the Galactic bulge exclude models with a disc scale height hz < ∼ 250 pc around R = 4 kpc, arguing for a constant thickness Galactic disc. The models also indicate that a spiral arm starting at the near end of the bar can contribute as much as 0. 5 × 10 − 6 to the optical depth in Baade’s Window.

The key associated with the sound was reversed twice during each 40 -min session. The reversal was signalled by changing key-light colour. The effect of the sounds on behaviour was assessed by measuring changes in the relative allocation of key pecks between the two keys (one with sound, the other without). A consistent effect of the sound was shown as a bias in both responding and time allocated to the keys. Bias could be seen in the behaviour measures for some sounds, and the biases owing to the presence of sound, were estimated mathematically from the generalized matching law. Generally, these noise biases increased with the increasing intensity of the sound and differed from sound type to sound type. Results showed that the sound of hens in a commerical poultry shed at 100 dB(A) was associated with the most bias and a piece of music at 90 and 95 dB(A) was associated with the least bias.
