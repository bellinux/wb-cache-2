He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, [...] "when Dad gave up music {{for a couple of}} years to be with Sean, why couldn't <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with me?" [...] More egregiously, however, Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the papers reported was [...] "believed to" [...] be in the area of £20million, which Julian has denied.|$|E

Did <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{because it made}} it easier to play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. [...] How can <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> when he can't pitch himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In fine, {{no other}} American writer ever had so slight a human basis for his work; no other ever labored more patiently or more carefully.
