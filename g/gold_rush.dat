5|$|Settlements of the <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into {{existence}} and then faded. The <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, {{a legacy of}} Chinese miners who came. While {{there are not many}} <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.|$|E
5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike <b>gold</b> <b>rush.</b> The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> such as The Last Great <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush.</b> The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush,</b> a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike <b>gold</b> <b>rush,</b> however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the <b>gold</b> <b>rush</b> approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E

The post office opened on 1 July 1843 as Mount Macedon and was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.|$|R

5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of <b>Gold</b> <b>Rush</b> was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great <b>gold</b> <b>rush.</b> Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E
