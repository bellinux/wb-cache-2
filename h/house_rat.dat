40|$|Social {{stress in}} rats {{is known to}} induce long-lasting, adverse changes in {{behaviour}} and physiology, which seem to resemble certain human psychopathologies, such as depression and anxiety. The present experiment was designed to assess the influence of individual or group housing on the vulnerability of male Wildtype rats to long-term effects of inescapable social defeat. Group-housed rats were individually exposed to an aggressive, unfamiliar male conspecific, resulting in a social defeat. Defeated rats were then either individually housed or returned to their group. The changes in their behaviour and physiology were then studied for 3 weeks. Results showed that individually <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> developed long-lasting, adverse behavioural and physiological changes after social defeat. Their body growth was significantly retarded (p<. 05) between 7 and 14 days after defeat. When individually and group-housed rats were exposed to a mild stressor (sudden silence) 2 days after defeat, both groups became highly immobile. However, when exposure was repeated at day 21, individually <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> were still highly immobile compared to group-housed rats which regained their normal mobility after only 7 days. In an open field test, also regularly repeated, individually <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> took significantly longer to leave their home base and were also significantly less mobile than group-housed rats over the entire 3 -week test period {{as well as at}} specific timepoints. When the rats were placed in an elevated plus-maze 14 days after defeat, those that were individually housed were significantly more anxious than those that were group-housed. When tested at 21 days after defeat in a combined dexamethasone (DEX) /corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) test, results showed that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) activity in individually <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> was higher. This was evidenced in the latter animals by the fact that DEX was significantly less able to suppress the secretion of ACTH and corticosterone, and by a significantly higher release of ACTH after administration of CRF. Although the weights of the spleen and testes of the two groups did not differ, the adrenals of individually <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> were larger and the thymus and seminal vesicles were smaller. We conclude that when rats are isolated after defeat, they show long-lasting, adverse behavioural and physiological changes that resemble symptoms of stress-related disorders. In contrast, when familiar <b>rats</b> are <b>housed</b> together these effects of a social defeat are greatly reduced. These findings show that housing conditions importantly influence the probability of long-term adverse behavioural and physiological effects of social defeat in male Wildtype rats...|$|R

40|$|Our recent {{findings}} {{revealed that}} the preputial gland of male <b>house</b> <b>rat</b> contains 20 kDa protein, however, the role of androgen {{in the production of}} this protein is not known. Hence, the present study was carried out to evaluate the androgen dependency of 20 kDa protein in the preputial gland of <b>house</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus rattus) and to compare its presence in female clitoral gland. Further, on castration the amount of glandular protein in male was significantly decreased to a certain extent, while testosterone treatment on castrated males showed an increasing trend. The electrophorogram of male <b>house</b> <b>rat</b> showed six different protein fractions with molecular weights of 90, 70, 60, 50, 35 and 20 kDa. However, the 70, 60, 50 and 35 kDa were absent in female. Among the different fractions, 90 and 20 kDa proteins were prominent. On castration, the 20 kDa protein was disappeared; while on testosterone treatment the protein reappeared.   Thus, the present study concludes that the 20 kDa protein is a testosterone dependent sex-associated protein. Since urinary protein is found to act as carrier for volatile substances in pheromonal communication.

Most surviving stroke patients show some degree of spontaneous recovery, but persistent symptoms in sensorimotor and cognitive functions are common. The symptoms can be reproduced in experimental stroke models in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. <b>Housing</b> <b>rats</b> in an enriched environment (EE), i. e. group housing in a large cage with toys that are changed daily, increases neuronal plasticity in healthy rats and can also improve functional recovery after experimental stroke. The present thesis investigates the effect of EE on the recovery of sensorimotor and cognitive functions one month after focal cerebral ischemia in rats, with emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, EE-induced effect on gene expression in healthy rats was investigated after different periods of EE-housing and at different time points of the day. We show an improved recovery of both sensorimotor and cognitive functions in <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in EE for one month after focal cerebral ischemia. The recovery of sensorimotor function correlated significantly to mRNA expression of the plasticity associated transcription factors NGFI-A and NGFI-B in hippocampus and cortical regions outside the infarct. Social interaction seems to be an important component for the beneficial effects of EE after focal cerebral ischemia. Microarray analysis of hippocampal gene expression after one month of postischemic environmental enrichment revealed no confirmable EE-induced changes that could explain the improved recovery in spatial memory. Interestingly, healthy <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in EE showed increased mRNA expression of NGFI-A and Krox- 20 exclusively during the dark period of the day compared to <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in isolation. In addition, EE <b>housed</b> <b>rats</b> had a substantial diurnal variation in NGFI-A, Krox- 20 and NGFI-B mRNA expression; this was absent in single-housed rats. EE-induced changes in gene expression are more evident during the dark period of the day, when rats are more active and can benefit from the stimulating environment. This is important to consider in future investigation of putative mediators of the EE-induced neuronal plasticity. In summary, these findings may contribute to an increased understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms behind improved functional recovery in <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in enriched environment after focal cerebral ischemia...|$|R

Histological observation and quantitative histological study indicates no major alteration in the rela- tive percentages of primary spermatocytes, spermatid and Sertoli cells at 10 days of posttreatment. But there was a gradual decrease in the seminiferous tubular diameter at 40 and 70 days of post treated groups. However, the Leydig and Sertoli cells morphology and number remained normal in all the treat- ment groups. At 40 days, the normal cellular associations in all the tubules were disrupted. The tubules constituted only spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and some zygotene spermatocytes. At 70 days, repopulation of Type A, Type B spermatogonia, resting and zygotene spermatocytes occurred at this stage. The tubules were still devoid of pachytene spermatocytes, spermatid and spermatozoa. At 100 days, active sper- matogenesis was observed in majority of the tubules.

Rats kept in an enriched environment before and after MCA ligation improved sooner and slightly more than those placed in the enriched environment after ischemia but with no lasting significant difference except for climbing. Preliminary studies suggest that social stimulation {{is more important than}} physical activity. Rats with fetal neocortical grafts implanted into the infarct cavity performed better if exposed to enriched environment than grafted control <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in standard laboratory cages with 5 rats in each cage. However, they did not perform better than non-grafted <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in the same enriched environment. The infarct size did not differ between <b>rats</b> <b>housed</b> in an enriched environment and control rats. There was no correlation between infarct size and performance in rats exposed to an enriched environment. The improved motor function suggest that a rich environment may stimulate mechanisms that enhance brain plasticity...|$|R
