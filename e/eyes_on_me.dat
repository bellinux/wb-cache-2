After being {{secretly}} admired by Laguna for some time, Julia introduces herself, as depicted in one of the flashback sequences. Julia reveals to Laguna her dream of writing her own songs and becoming a singer. Laguna is shipped out on new orders the following day and the ensuing circumstances prevent him from returning. Julia eventually marries Galbadian military officer General Caraway and has a daughter, Rinoa. She also finds success with her song [...] "Eyes On Me", which is also the game's theme song.

500|$|Circus {{opens with}} its lead single [...] "Womanizer". It {{features}} synth sirens with a repetitive chorus, and lyrically discusses a cheating man; it {{was described by}} Spears as a girl anthem. [...] "Circus" [...] addresses her feelings as an entertainer and performing, highlighted in the lines [...] "All <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> in {{the centre of the}} ring just like a circus / When I crack that whip everybody gonna trip just like a circus". Its electronic dance elements were compared to those of Spears's earlier single [...] "Break the Ice". The ballad [...] "Out from Under" [...] incorporates acoustic guitar backings, and has gathered comparisons to her track [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] is a dance-pop song that talks about Spears's conflict with paparazzi. Critics noted similarities to the works of Madonna as well as Spears's own [...] "Piece of Me". [...] "Shattered Glass" [...] utilizes dark electronic beats and details a non-repairable relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} The 3rd Birthday was {{composed}} by Mitsuto Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Sekito, with additional work by original Parasite Eve composer Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was involved {{from an early}} stage, when The 3rd Birthday was still a mobile game. When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved {{with a number of}} other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with anyone on the composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for Parasite Eve, with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original Parasite Eve when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes. Re-orchestrations of two pieces of classical music, [...] "Sleepers Wake" [...] by Johann Sebastian Bach, and [...] "Joy to the World", a popular Christmas song, were used by Suzuki and Shimomura respectively to represent key moments and motifs within the game. The order of songs in the game was created to reflect the situation in a level. These variations were emphasized during mixing, while they also needed to adjust the mixing and track length based on the game as a whole. For the game's theme song, the company collaborated with Japanese rock band Superfly. The game's theme song <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>Me,</b> described as a [...] "standard love song", was specially composed by the band for the game. It was the band's first video game theme song. The game's soundtrack was released as an album by Square Enix on December 22, 2010. The 3rd Birthday Original Soundtrack contains 66 tracks across 3 discs and has a total length of 2:56:52.|$|E
