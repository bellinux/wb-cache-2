It is shown that the known instability of the quasilinear theory (QLT) for sufficiently high wave amplitudes (in respect to enhancement of wave-particle correlation and formation of space-time coherent structures) makes it invalid for describing plasma dynamics and turbulent transport {{in the majority of}} open plasma configurations. A typical example is the classical problem concerning a warm electron beam steadily injected into Maxwellian plasma half-space.

50|$|The {{issue is}} {{specifically}} addressed in major regulatory frameworks. In Europe, for instance, “nonrelevant” metabolites are distinguished from metabolites that are “relevant for groundwater resources” or even “ecotoxicologically relevant”. The latter are those whose risk to soil or aquatic biota is comparable or {{higher than the}} parent and must meet the same standards as their parent. Groundwater-relevant metabolites are those likely to reach groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 μg/liter and to display the same toxicity as the parent compound. In the past toxicology issues typically emerged only decades after market introduction. Examples are the detection of chloridazon products (first marketed in 1964) in surface and groundwater, or tolylfluanid (first marketed in 1971). That these substances were overlooked for so long may partially be attributable to prior limits on analytical capabilities. However, labeling some metabolites as nonrelevant may have resulted in directing attention away from them. The decision to tolerate up to 10 μg/liter of “nonrelevant” metabolites in groundwater and drinking water is politically highly contentious in Europe. Some consider the higher limit acceptable as no imminent health risk can be proven, whereas others regard it as a <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviation</b> from the precautionary principle.|$|E

For this reason, some allowance, or minimum difference, between the PDs {{of the internal}} and external threads has to generally be provided for, to eliminate the possibility of deviations from the ideal thread form causing interference and to expedite hand assembly up to the length of engagement. Such allowances, or <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviations,</b> as ISO standards call them, are provided for in various degrees in corresponding classes of fit for ranges of thread sizes. At one extreme, no allowance is provided by a class, but the maximum PD of the external thread is specified to be the same as the minimum PD of the internal thread, within specified tolerances, ensuring that the two can be assembled, with some looseness of fit still possible due to the margin of tolerance. A class called interference fit may even provide for negative allowances, where the PD of the screw is greater than the PD of the nut by at least the amount of the allowance.|$|R

There are <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviations</b> from the properties for classic bulk Alfvén waves. (1) There is no local equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy.

(3) The energy densities and the flux of energy vary spatially, contrary to the case of classic bulk Alfvén waves. This last property has the important consequence that the energy flux computed with the well known expression for bulk Alfvén waves could overestimate the real flux by a factor in the range 10 - 50, depending on the flux tube equilibrium properties. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), {{also referred to}} as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), is {{the most common cause of}} hyponatremia characterized by extracellular hypotonicity and impaired urine dilution in the absence of any recognizable nonosmotic stimuli for the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Hyponatremia in SIADH is primarily the result of excessive water retention caused by a combination of inappropriate antidiuresis and persistent fluid intake in the presence of impaired osmoregulated inhibition of thirst. It is sometimes aggravated by a sodium deficiency caused by a decreased intake or a secondary natriuresis in response to elevated extracellular volume. Inappropriate antidiuresis usually results from endogenous production of AVP that can be either ectopic (from a malignancy) or eutopic (from the hypothalamus/neurohypophysis). Regardless of its origin, different types of osmotic dysregulation of AVP have been reported with possibly <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviations</b> in treatment need and efficacy. A recent quantitative analysis of 50 patients with SIADH, which underwent serial measurements of copeptin during hypertonic saline infusion, revealed five distinct types of osmoregulatory defect ("type A to E") without affiliation to specific underlying diseases. In addition to apparently impaired osmoregulated inhibition of AVP release in the majority of patients, 12 % of patients showed an AVP-independent mechanism of inappropriate antidiuresis, whilst 20 % of them presented a reverse relation between hormone release and serum osmolality, presumably related to interrupted nonosmotic inhibitory pathways. The interference of these different types of SIAD with clinical presentation and therapy response will be a relevant subject for future research...|$|R

40|$|Although {{bisexual}} reproduction {{has proven to}} be highly successful, parthenogenetic all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species 1, 2 supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviation</b> from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologs reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitnes...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory is}} {{advanced}} that Thomas Mann conceived of religion not as adherence to any orthodox dogma, {{but as an}} attitude defined as "religiously-based humanism," the characteristics of which are: scepticism toward both belief and disbelief; modesty; reverence for man despite a profoundly pessimistic view of human history; the belief that life {{is a process of}} atonement and purification, and that "higher health" is attainable only through the experience of death and "that which lies below"; and a sense of detachment from the mundane, everyday world. In Chapter I, Thomas Mann's religious ideas and Nietzsche's influence upon them are discussed in terms of Thomas Mann's major fictional works, his lectures, correspondence, and theoretical writings. Chapter II, an examination of religion in Buddenbrooks, attempts to show that the elements of Thomas Mann's conception of religion are already present in this first major work.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} real exchange rate (RER) uncertainty on output {{in the context of}} Southern Cone economies. The first chapter provides a framework to analyze the output effects of RER uncertainty when firms contract dollar-debt and no hedging instruments are available, by focusing on the channel uncertainty-output operating through the firms financial strategy. An increase in uncertainty increases the probability of bankruptcy, raising expected marginal bankruptcy costs, and reducing optimal output of a risk-neutral firm. We find the output response to uncertainty shocks to depend on firms' liquidity balances, trade orientation and perceptions about government assistance if large exchange rate movements occur. The second chapter examines empirically RER uncertainty effects on sectoral output for 28 manufacturing sectors in the Southern Cone over 1970 - 2002. We use alternative uncertainty measures allowing different degrees of sophistication in agents' expectation mechanisms to estimate a supply function. We use instrumental variable techniques to address potential simultaneity problems. Results suggest a negative non-negligible effect of uncertainty on output, threshold effects, and sectoral heterogeneity, explained by trade orientation, the intensity with which sectors trade within Mercosur and by sectoral productivity. The fourth chapter investigates the importance of past exchange rate behaviour when forming expectations and tests for the uncovered interest parity (UIP) hypothesis in Uruguay. Using interest rate differentials over 1980 - 2010 we identify a strong extrapolative component in expectations, following an inverted-U pattern over time. Agents internalise announcements and shocks that may affect <b>fundamentals.</b> <b>Deviations</b> from UIP are low for high-inflation periods, and highfor low-inflation periods and freely floating regimes. As long as what it takes to predict well is simple (look backwards, follow announcements), interest rate differentials perform well.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} experiments for {{the exploration of}} the corium spreading behaviour, but comparable data have not been available up to now in the field of the long term behaviour of a corium expanded in a core catcher. The difficulty consists in the experimental simulation of the decay heat that can be neglected for the short-run course of events like relocation and spreading, which must, however, be considered during investigation of the long time behaviour. Therefore the German GRS, defined together with Battelle Ingenieurtechnik a benchmark problem in order to determine particular problems and differences of CFD codes simulating an expanded corium and from this, requirements for a reasonable measurement of experiments, that will be performed later. First the finite-volume-codes Comet 1. 023, CFX 4. 2 and CFX-TASCflow were used. To be able to make comparisons to a finite-element-code, now calculations are performed at the Institute of Safety Research at the Forschungszentrum Rossendorf with the code ANSYS/FLOTRAN. For the benchmark calculations of stage 1 a pure and liquid melt with internal heat sources was assumed uniformly distributed over the area of the planned core catcher of a EPR plant. Using the Standard-k-#epsilon#-turbulence model and assuming an initial state of a motionless superheated melt several large convection rolls will establish within the melt pool. The temperatures at the surface do not sink to a solidification level due to the enhanced convection heat transfer. The temperature gradients at the surface are relatively flat while there are steep gradients at the ground where the no slip condition is applied. But even at the ground no solidification temperatures are observed. Although the problem in the ANSYS-calculations is handled two-dimensional and not three-dimensional like in the finite-volume-codes, there are no <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviations</b> to the results of the other codes.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and {{is applied to}} magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate remarkably high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects, thus enabling very precise localization of morphological characteristics in population studies. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i. e. a set of geometric moment invariants that is defined on each voxel in an image, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure. This is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>deviation</b> of our method from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, it employs a hierarchical deformation mechanism, which is initially influenced by parts of the anatomy that can be identified relatively more reliably than others. Moreover, the deformation mechanism involves a sequence of local smooth transformations, which do not update positions of individual voxels, but rather are based on evaluating a similarity of attribute vectors over a larger subvolume of a volumetric image. This renders this algorithm very robust to suboptimal solutions. A number of experiments in this paper have demonstrated excellent performance. 1...|$|E
