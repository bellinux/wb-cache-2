25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E

500|$|Interdisciplinary data {{collection}} looks at systems from a specific moral position and viewpoint instead of attempting {{the perspective of}} a neutral observer. The intention is not to create a more [...] "subjective" [...] methodology, but to counter biases in existing methodologies, by recognizing that all explanations for world phenomena arise from socially-influenced viewpoints. Feminist <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> too many theories claim to present universal principles but actually present a masculine viewpoint {{in the guise of a}} [...] "view from nowhere", so more varied sources of {{data collection}} are needed to mediate those issues.|$|E
500|$|A {{growing number}} of investors and <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> Eurobonds {{would be the best}} way of solving a debt crisis, though their {{introduction}} matched by tight financial and budgetary co-ordination may well require changes in EU treaties. On 21 November 2011, the European Commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by the 17 euro nations would be an effective way to tackle the financial crisis. Using the term [...] "stability bonds", Jose Manuel Barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances.|$|E

Before becoming an <b>economist,</b> <b>Say</b> was the editor of a literary and political journal in the seventeen-nineties, which truly was an Enlightenment organ.

2500|$|The Industrial Revolution marks a major {{turning point}} in history; {{almost every aspect of}} daily life was {{influenced}} in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. [...] Some <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently {{for the first time in}} history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mainstream}} economics, {{the concept}} of a market is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The exchange of goods or services, with or without money, is a transaction. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its price, which is a major topic of study of economics and has given rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and demand. A major topic of debate is how much a given market can be considered to be a [...] "free market", that is free from government intervention. Microeconomics traditionally focuses on the study of market structure and the efficiency of market equilibrium; when the latter (if it exists) is not efficient, then <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that a market failure has occurred. However it is not always clear how the allocation of resources can be improved since there is always the possibility of government failure.|$|E
2500|$|Wallonia {{exemplified}} {{the radical}} evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word [...] "houille" [...] was coined in Wallonia), the region geared {{up to become}} the 2nd industrial {{power in the world}} after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its Sillon industriel, 'Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'. Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: [...] "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain." [...] "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent." [...] Michel De Coster, Professor at the Université de Liège wrote also: [...] "The historians and the <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{economist}} Jeffrey Sachs said, [...] "My {{concern is}} not {{that there are too}} many sweatshops, but that there are too few." [...] Sachs and other proponents of free trade and the global movement of capital cite the economic theory of comparative advantage, which states that international trade will, in the long run, make all parties better off. The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do [...] "better" [...] than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.|$|E

The process would be visible enough if you could [...] only see the books of the bill-brokers and the bankers.

On the other [...] hand, if, in consequence of a bad harvest, the corn trade becomes [...] on a sudden profitable, immediately ‘corn bills’ are created in [...] large numbers, and, if good, are discounted [at the banks].

50|$|In economics, demand {{refers to}} the {{strength}} of one or many consumers' willingness to purchase a good or goods at any in a range of prices. If, for example, a rise in income causes a consumer to be willing to purchase more of a good than before contingent on each possible price, <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that the income rise has caused the consumer's demand for the good to rise. In contrast, if a change in market conditions leads to a decline in the price of a good resulting in a consumer's being willing to buy more of it, <b>economists</b> <b>say</b> that the consumer's quantity demanded of the good has risen. A change in quantity demanded is represented by a movement along the demand curve, while a change in demand is represented by a shift of the demand curve.|$|E
