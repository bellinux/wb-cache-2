2500|$|Les Femmes (1969) was a flop, {{although}} the screwball comedy The Bear and the Doll (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: Les Novices (1970), Boulevard du Rhum (1971) (with Lino Ventura). The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> in her as a woman and I had to {{get to the end of}} something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom - she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man - that amused me.|$|E
2500|$|The study Holy Feast and Holy Fast, my most {{influential}} book, arose almost seamlessly from [...] "Jesus as Mother." [...] Having explored the pressures and opportunities that led certain groups of religious men to use explicitly gendered images {{for themselves and}} for the divine, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> about whether religious women did so. And I discovered, again to put it a bit simply, that what seemed distinctive about woman-authored texts and male accounts of women was not awareness of gender or complex and self-conscious use of gendered language, but food images and food practices. Although misunderstood by some critics as [...] "essentializing" [...] (this was a nasty charge in the 1990s) or as a glorification of female masochism, {{it was in fact}} neither. The argument that women’s texts were characterized by specific metaphors and their lives by specific behaviors was not the imposition of modern assumptions about [...] "woman." [...] It was empirical, based on a careful comparison of female-authored texts about the divine, female-authored texts about women, and male-authored texts about women, with texts about men by religious men, such as St. Francis of Assisi or Heinrich Suso, who appeared to be closest in their spirituality to that of women.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in the slightest," [...] he answered. [...] "That is to say, sympathetically interested. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious.</b> <b>I</b> {{will admit}} that. No more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, speak, Emlyn," [...] said Cicely, [...] "for though I {{never asked}} before, fearing my own weakness, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious.</b> None can hear us here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Horn's first {{photographic}} installation, You Are The Weather (1994-1996), {{a photographic}} cycle featuring 100 close-up {{shots of the}} same woman, Margret, {{in a variety of}} Icelandic geothermal pools, deals with the enigma of identity captured through a series of facial expressions dictated by imperceptible weather changes. Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to see if I could elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a Subject Index that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who is staring at you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the Subject Index, [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face smudges the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} showed me the letter he had written. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to see it, but had not ventured to ask for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't deny it, sir. I only {{mentioned}} the circumstance because I wished {{to acknowledge that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> and am curious about Miss Gwilt." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to {{know what}} Captain Brown can {{have to say to}} me. In a few minutes, Mr. Blades, Lieutenant Spicer, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> at your service.|$|R

6000|$|... "Neither, thank you," [...] Maraton answered. [...] "I {{am here to}} listen. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to {{hear what}} there {{is that you can}} have to say to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gladly,' I answered, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> {{to see the}} place, but {{the noble}} hesitated awhile, though {{in the end he}} came with us, to his ill-fortune.|$|E
60|$|With Old File, as I have said, I {{became quite}} friendly. Excepting {{the secrets of}} our prison-house, he was ready enough to talk on {{subjects}} about which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No; only <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to see {{the house}} where the friend of the people lives, and as I was passing {{the end of the street}} turned down. Will you drink a glass?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A nous moutons!' exclaimed Tantalus; 'I {{was about}} to observe that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to learn for what reason our friend Sisyphus was doomed to his late terrible exertions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Sultan did {{not wait}} for Scheherazade to ask his leave. [...] "Finish," [...] said he, [...] "the story of the genius and the merchant. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to hear the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{anxious to}} hear it," [...] {{answered}} Clarke, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> {{to see this}} man Wetzel, whose fame has reached {{as far as my}} home, way down in Virginia." ...|$|R
60|$|Finding {{the fresh}} milky juice of Calotropis {{to be only}} 72 degrees, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to {{ascertain}} at what depth this temperature was to be obtained in the sand of the river-bed, where the plant grew.|$|E
6000|$|... "You noticed, at least, I suppose, {{that she}} was not afraid to speak. I never {{repeated}} it, not because I was jealous, but because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to see how long your ignorance would last if left to itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand, sir, that we {{are obliged}} to be {{cautious}} here; and it seemed so strange that so young an officer should have attained the rank of colonel, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> {{to know how it}} could have occurred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means--if {{you wish}} it," [...] he {{answered}} undisturbed. [...] "At the same time, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> {{to know why}} you came here at all if you did not intend to accept it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> already," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What {{are the two}} {{or three}} things, Sir George? Why! Do you see--nearly every one has gone," [...] she added suddenly. [...] "Come along!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{unnecessary}} {{to make the}} test, sir," [...] he replied. [...] "The pearl Andrews gave to Miss Doyle is as unmistakable as your own. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to hear your opinion, Mr. Weldon." ...|$|R
60|$|But this is {{no place}} for making mention of all the {{subjects}} upon which I and my Lascar friend mostly discoursed; I will only try to give his account of the teakwood and kayar rope, concerning which things <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> and sought information.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Barbara. [...] "To keep {{behind and}} meet you after I'd sent Lister off {{would not have}} bothered me. However, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> {{although}} I think I knew the line he'd take. You see, for an unsophisticated young man, the situation was awkward." ...|$|E
60|$|These biographies sent me {{to another}} old book, Leland on Revelation, which told me much <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> {{to know about the}} mythologies and systems of {{philosophy}} of the ancients--the innumerable false cults which had flourished in a darkened world before the dawn of the true religion.|$|E
6000|$|... "This one {{is quite}} {{good enough for}} a hog," [...] was the reply; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> {{to know if you}} will keep your promise, so I'll just amuse myself until you come down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> in {{the matter}} of old religions, and seeing the symbol of Life upon yonder peak, came hither to study yours, of which indeed a {{tradition}} still remains among the learned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have given}} me a {{wonderful}} idea of your story," [...] she murmured. [...] "Nothing has charmed me so much for a long while. Now the only thing which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> about <b>is</b> the style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{occurrence}} {{of that sort}} marks a man," [...] the homely murmur went on. [...] "I admit <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to see you. General T--- {{thought it would be}} useful, too.... Don't think I am incapable of understanding your sentiments. When I was young like you I studied...." ...|$|E
60|$|Millers, who was {{the other}} nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, {{as if it were}} a young ventriloquist with {{something}} in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the time, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> to know what the book could be.|$|E
60|$|Captain Dan {{advised a}} long line out {{so that we could}} circle the fish from a {{distance}} and not scare him.

6000|$|... "To be {{sure they}} will--especially after all we did for them on the Lakes," [...] put in Sam. [...] "But let me tell you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to know how {{this thing is going}} to end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We do,' said Herbert; 'and I {{think we}} must make one; we must inquire at Genoa. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> in {{fountain}}s. Our fountain should, <b>I</b> think, <b>be</b> classical; simple, compact, with a choice inscription, the altar of a Naiad.' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{we came to}} {{know her}} my {{judgment}} was warped, so that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> to recollect what my unbiassed{sic} instincts were. It is hard, however, to eliminate the feelings which reason or prejudice afterwards raised in me.|$|R
