Now that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> under Kinkaid's command, Christie renewed his push to get Dealey awarded the Medal of Honor, this time by getting the endorsement for the decoration from MacArthur. The general agreed, and Dealey was posthumously awarded the medal.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017, Cawthon tweeted {{a picture}} at Blumhouse Productions, {{suggesting}} the film {{had a new}} production company. In May 2017, producer Jason Blum confirmed the news, claiming he was excited and working closely with Cawthon on the adaptation. In June 2017, Kenan said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> directing the film after Warner Bros. Pictures' turnaround.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, even if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E

5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse {{it would be difficult}} to return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style {{was very different from}} Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E

5|$|In August 1930, St Hill {{signed a}} {{contract}} to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in England, which meant that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> eligible to play cricket for Shannon or Trinidad. At the time, competition rules barred professional cricketers from taking part. Consequently, the first-class matches he played in Australia were {{the last of his}} career. In his eight seasons in the Bonanza Cup, St Hill took 224 wickets at an average of 9.42, and topped the bowling averages for the competition in 1924 and 1929.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{after months}} of public tensions, Bonamassa {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in 2016, with fourth album BCCIV released in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Jack Mann bought Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-branded it New Kona Lanes the {{following}} year. Mann's family owned several bowling {{centers in the}} region; he was behind the creation of Fountain Bowl in 1973 and the short-lived Regal Lanes in Orange in 1974. He also owned Tustin Lanes before selling it to his youngest son, Alex. Mann bought Kona not because he loved bowling, but because it would continue to pay dividends if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> able to work. He later sold Kona to his son Jack Jr.|$|E

While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics {{even though he had}} already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.|$|E
5|$|That same night, the criollos {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Rodriguez Pena and compiled a list of members for a governing Junta that was presented on 25 May. Meanwhile, Domingo French, Antonio Beruti, Aparicio, Donado, and other armed men occupied the Plaza and its access points. The list included a balance of representatives from different extractions of local politics. Lezica finally reported to Cisneros that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> in command, and the Primera Junta assumed power.|$|E

5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> as close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E

He died on April18, 1930, at the age of 62 in Ashland, and is interred at Brock Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
