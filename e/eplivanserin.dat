40|$|The serotonergic system appears {{crucial for}} (±) - 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) {{reinforcing}} properties. Current {{evidence indicates that}} serotonin 5 -HT 2 A receptors (5 -HT 2 ARs) modulate mesolimbic dopamine (DA) activity and several behavioural responses related to the addictive properties of psychostimulants. This study evaluated the role of 5 -HT 2 ARs in MDMA-induced reinforcement and hyperlocomotion, and the reinstatement of MDMA-seeking behaviour. Basal and MDMA-stimulated extracellular levels of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and serotonin and noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex were also assessed. Self-administration of MDMA was blunted in 5 -HT 2 AR knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates at both doses tested (0. 125 and 0. 25 mg/kg per infusion). Horizontal locomotion was increased by MDMA (10 and 20 mg/kg i. p.) to a higher extent in KO than in WT mice. DA outflow in the NAc was lower in KO compared to WT mice under basal conditions and after MDMA (20 mg/kg) challenge. In WT mice, MDMA (5 and 10 mg/kg i. p.) priming did not reinstate MDMA-seeking behaviour, while cue-induced reinstatement was prominent. This cue-induced reinstatement was blocked by administration of the selective 5 -HT 2 AR antagonist, SR 46349 B (<b>eplivanserin)</b> at a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg, but not at 0. 25 mg/kg. Our results indicate that 5 -HT 2 ARs are crucial for MDMA-induced reinforcement and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA-seeking behaviour. These effects are {{probably due to the}} modulation of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity. This work was supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III FIS grant no. PI 070709 (to P.
