Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle}} of the night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} this would be a safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E
