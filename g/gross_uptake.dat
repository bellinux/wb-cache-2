40|$|Nitrate and nitrite (NO x) and {{phosphate}} (PO 4) dynamics over Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, {{are shown}} {{to depend on}} oceanographic forcing of coupled mass transfer limited (MTL) <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> and gross release from remineralized oceanic particulate organic matter (POM). Estimates of gross release rates increased significantly with increasing POM uptake and were of the same order as <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> rates. <b>Gross</b> <b>uptake</b> rates increased significantly with increasing oceanic concentrations and wave energy dissipation, were 35 - 80 higher over the reef crest (7 - 9 mmol NO x m - 2 d - 1 and 4 - 5 mmol PO 4 m - 2 d - 1), and were significantly correlated with independent estimates of POM-mediated gross NO x uptake, supporting both MTL uptake and the strong role of oceanic POM supply. The relative supply of NO x and POM {{was linked to the}} seasonal dynamics of a regional current system. In late spring, upwelling associated with seasonally strong equator-ward winds led to increased NOx concentrations (0. 71 Â± 0. 2 Î¼mol L - 1), POM NO x and the reef was a net nutrient source (- 7060 mmol NO x m - 1 d - 1 and - 730 mmol PO 4 m - 1 d - 1). The autumn enhancement of oceanic POM supply to the reef can be attributed to a regional phytoplankton bloom associated with acceleration of the oligotrophic Leeuwin Current, which may result in a significant supply of dissolved nutrients to downstream communities.

40|$|Nutrient {{dynamics}} in rivers {{are central to}} global biogeochemistry. We measured ammonium (NH 4 +) uptake, metabolism, nitrification, and denitrification in the thalweg, the river region of greatest flow, of the Kansas River (discharge = 14, 360 L/s). We estimated gross and net uptake with a depleted 15 N-NH 4 + release, metabolism with diel O 2 measurements, and denitrification with dissolved N 2 measurements. Net ecosystem production was negative. Net NH 4 + uptake length was 2. 1 km when concentrations were elevated, and <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> length was 1. 9 km at ambient concentrations. <b>Gross</b> <b>uptake</b> rate measurements were comparable to estimates made using extrapolations from data obtained from streams (systems with 1 / 10 th or less the discharge). Calculated lengths were maximal because the isotope pulse was primarily confined to the thalweg and not the shallow side channels or backwaters. Denitrification and nitrification rates were below detection. In the Kansas River, rates of N cycling are driven by heterotrophic processes, and considerable processing of N, particularly NH 4 + uptake, occurred over a few kilometers of river length, with net uptake rates of NH 4 + increasing with greater NH 4 + concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} and sapflow {{data from}} three Mediterranean ecosystems were analysed via top-down approaches {{in conjunction with}} a mechanistic ecosystem gas-exchange model to test current assumptions about drought effects on ecosystem respiration and canopy CO(2) /H(2) O exchange. The three sites include two nearly monospecific Quercus ilex L. forests - one on karstic limestone (Puechabon), the other on fluvial sand with access to ground water (Castelporziano) - and a typical mixed macchia on limestone (Arca di Noe). Estimates of ecosystem respiration were derived from light response curves of net ecosystem CO(2) exchange. Subsequently, values of ecosystem <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> were computed from eddy covariance CO(2) fluxes and estimates of ecosystem respiration as a function of soil temperature and moisture. Bulk canopy conductance was calculated by inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation. In a top-down analysis, it was shown that all three sites exhibit similar behaviour in terms of their overall response to drought. In contrast to common assumptions, at all sites ecosystem respiration revealed a decreasing temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in response to drought. Soil temperature and soil water content explained 70 - 80 % of the seasonal variability of ecosystem respiration. During the drought, light-saturated ecosystem <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> and day-time averaged canopy conductance declined by up to 90 %. These changes were closely related to soil water content. Ecosystem water-use efficiency of <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> decreased during the drought, regardless whether evapotranspiration from eddy covariance or transpiration from sapflow had been used for the calculation. We evidence that this clearly contrasts current models of canopy function which predict increasing ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) during the drought. Four potential explanations to those results were identified (patchy stomatal closure, changes in physiological capacities of photosynthesis, decreases in mesophyll conductance for CO(2), and photoinhibition), which will be tested in a forthcoming paper. It is suggested to incorporate the new findings into current biogeochemical models after further testing as this will improve estimates of climate change effects on (semi) arid ecosystems' carbon balances...|$|R

Photosynthetic electron transfer rates, expressed as gross O 2 evolution, were determined from fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorometry and discrete laboratory measurements of the photosynthetic unit size. These gross O 2 evolution determinations were also made free from contemporaneous dark-adapted FRR measurements {{and the need for}} sample blanks. Net and <b>gross</b> CO 2 <b>uptake</b> was determined from changes in total inorganic carbon calculated from in situ pH measurements. Two phases to the bloom were observed. An initial bloom was dominated by the diatom Asterionella formosa, while a secondary phase was characterized by an increase in flagellates and cyanobacteria. For both phases, daily FRR-based gross O 2 evolution and pH-based <b>gross</b> CO 2 <b>uptake</b> were tightly coupled, suggesting that daily gross O 2 production was driving daily changes in CO 2 assimilation and thus in community metabolism. This is the first investigation to show closely related rates of gross O 2 production and CO 2 uptake measured in situ. ...|$|R

Summer CPQ (0. 79; SD 0. 02) was significantly lower than 1 due to the combined effect of the daily evolution of the community respiration and the discrepancy between the daily evolution in community oxygen respiration and community carbon respiration.

These varieties (which are not single homozygous lines) also show large variation between individuals. The <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> of Na+ is, however, poorly correlated with growth and survival because net transport interacts with vigour and degree of dwarfing and because NaCl is compartmentalized within the plant confounding any simple relationship between tissue concentration, growth reduction and toxicity symptoms. It is argued that resistance is conferred by no single factor, but {{is the sum of}} a number of contributory traits which include variation in (1) NaCl entry via membrane leakage or apoplastic pathways; (2) preferential accumulation of Na+ in the older leaves; and (3) tolerance of NaCl within the leaf tissue which may reflect differences in apoplastic salt load.

40|$|Headwater streams are {{recipients}} of water sources draining through terrestrial ecosystems. At the same time, stream biota can transform and retain nutrients dissolved in stream water. Yet studies considering simultaneously these two sources {{of variation in}} stream nutrient chemistry are rare. To fill this gap of knowledge, we analyzed stream water and riparian groundwater concentrations and fluxes as well as in-stream net uptake rates for nitrate (NO 3 −), ammonium (NH 4 +), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) along a 3. 7 km reach on an annual basis. Chloride concentrations (used as conservative tracer) indicated a strong hydrological connection at the riparian–stream interface. However, stream and riparian groundwater nutrient concentrations showed a moderate to null correlation, suggesting high in-stream biogeochemical processing. In-stream net nutrient uptake (F sw) was highly variable across contiguous segments and over time, but its temporal variation {{was not related to}} the vegetative period of the riparian forest. For NH 4 +, the occurrence of F sw > 0 μg N m − 1 s − 1 (<b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> > release) was high along the reach, while for NO 3 −, the occurrence of F sw − 1 s − 1 (<b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> < release) increased along the reach. Within segments and dates, F sw, whether negative or positive, accounted for a median of 6, 18, and 20 % of the inputs of NO 3 −, NH 4 +, and SRP, respectively. Whole-reach mass balance calculations indicated that in-stream net uptake reduced stream NH 4 + flux up to 90 %, while the stream acted mostly as a source of NO 3 − and SRP. During the dormant period, concentrations decreased along the reach for NO 3 −, but increased for NH 4 + and SRP. During the vegetative period, NH 4 + decreased, SRP increased, and NO 3 − showed a U-shaped pattern along the reach. These longitudinal trends resulted from the combination of hydrological mixing with terrestrial inputs and in-stream nutrient processing. Therefore, the assessment of these two sources of variation in stream water chemistry is crucial to understand the contribution of in-stream processes to stream nutrient dynamics at relevant ecological scales...|$|E

40|$|As forests age, their {{structure}} and productivity change, yet in some cases, annual rates of water loss remain unchanged. To identify mechanisms {{that might explain}} such observations, and to determine if widely different age classes of forests differ functionally, we examined young (Y, similar tO 2 5 years), mature (M, similar to 90 years) and old (O, similar tO 2 50 years) ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws.) stands growing in a drought-prone region of central Oregon. Although the stands differed in tree leaf area index (LAI(T)) (Y = 0. 9, M = 2. 8, O = 2. 1), cumulative tree transpiration measured by sap flow did not differ substantially {{during the growing season}} (100112 mm). Yet when water was readily available, transpiration per unit leaf area of the youngest trees was about three times that of M trees and five times that of 0 trees. These patterns resulted from a nearly sixfold difference in leaf specific conductance (K-L) between the youngest and oldest trees. At the time of maximum transpiration in the Y stand in May-June, <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> (<b>gross</b> ecosystem production, GEP) was similar for Y and O stands despite an almost twofold difference in stand leaf area index (LAI(S)). However, the higher rate of water use by Y trees was not sustainable in the drought-prone environment, and between spring and late summer, K-L of Y trees declined fivefold compared with a nearly twofold decline for M trees and a < 30 % reduction in O trees. Because the Y stand contained a significant shrub understory and more exposed soil, there was no appreciable difference in mean daily latent energy fluxes between the Y stand and the older stands as measured by the eddy-covariance technique. These patterns resulted in 60 to 85 % higher seasonal GEP and 55 to 65 % higher water-use efficiency at the M and 0 stands compared with the Y stand. [References: 29...|$|R

The forest’s monthly nitrate supply varied by a factor of 50, while measured net nitrogen acquisition varied only fivefold. Maximum net nitrogen acquisition rates for fronds in the forest interior were 0. 18 mmol N g 21 month 21 during spring upwelling in 2005 and declined fourfold during autumn until upwelling resumed the following year. Modeled gross nitrogen uptake with consideration of Michaelis–Menten kinetics for nitrate and mass transfer limitation was higher than observed net acquisition except during the warm stratified summer and autumn months, when net acquisition exceeded modeled <b>gross</b> <b>uptake.</b> This shortfall indicates that the kelp forest received over half its nitrogen from sources other than nitrate such as ammonium from epibionts.

40|$|Management {{of point}} and diffuse sources of {{nutrient}} requires quantification of permanent loss and transformations that affect periphyton biomass in streams and nutrient loads to downstream lakes and estuaries. The “nutrient addition method ” {{is commonly used}} to quantify nutrient loss in streams {{in terms of the}} uptake length Sw (Stream Solute Workshop 1990). A simplified computer model is used to conduct numerical experiments and determine whether Sw values enable managers to quantify the impact of nutrient spiralling on periphyton and/or permanent nutrient removal. Uptake lengths are estimated in two different ways. Method 1 examines the rate of change of inorganic nutrient concentration without subtracting “background ” concentration. It yields estimates of “net ” uptake (<b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> minus mineralisation) that are fairly easy to interpret and which indicate whether or not the system is in “equilibrium”. Method 2 is advocated by the Stream Solute Workshop and examines the increase in nutrient concentration above “background”. It yields Sw values that vary with distance in a manner which is hard to interpret. Neither method furnishes an estimate of permanent nutrient removal and structured growth models that incorporate intracellular storage and time lags between uptake and growth are probably required for this.

40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} {{melphalan}} {{on the growth}} of 4 different lines of human lung-tumour xenografts has been established. The oat-cell carcinoma was the most sensitive, whereas the adenocarcinoma was the most resistant. Two lines of large-cell anaplastic carcinomas were intermediate in sensitivity. The differences in sensitivity were not reflected in the <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> of drug into the tumours. There was, {{with the exception of}} the adenocarcinoma line, a marked decrease in uptake per g tumour with increasing tumour size. This was partly caused by a decrease in the vascular supply in the same tumours with increasing tumour size. Extravasation of plasma proteins increased with increasing tumour size in all tumours, but was much less pronounced in the adenocarcinoma than in the other tumour lines. The extracellular volume of the various tumour lines did not vary with tumour size. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS of recent research into the xenografting of human tumours is that it has enabled examples of chemoresistant and chemosensitive tumours to be established in the laboratory, and their sensitivity to treatment to be accurately quantified (Steel, 1978; Shorthouse et al., 1980). This then enables investigations to be made into the mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between response and drug access in the treatment of 4 different lines of lung-tumour xenografts with the alkylating agent melphalan. The lines were chosen because of their widely different sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (Shorthouse et al., 1980) ...|$|E

Midday gross photosynthesis was 0. 5 to 1. 0 micro mol m(- 2) s(- 1) by feather moss and 0. 5 to 2. 5 micro mol m(- 2) s(- 1) by sphagnum moss. Photosynthesis by sphagnum moss was reduced by approximately 70 % at 0 degrees C, and reached a maximum rate at 8 degrees C.

The higher rates of respiration at the feather moss sites probably reflected a greater belowground input of carbon from black spruce, and the lower rates of photosynthesis were probably associated with shading by the black spruce canopy.

40|$|In boreal forests, {{the main}} factors {{limiting}} biomass production are the harsh climate, which combines a short growing season and low annual levels of incoming solar energy, {{and the limited}} availability of nitrogen. These limitations will be directly affected by climate change, and may in turn substantially affect the carbon budget of the boreal forests, the production of wood and biofuel, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. This thesis addresses the {{effects of climate change}} on the rate of carbon assimilation by boreal Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.) Karst. The study focussed on examining how the mechanisms regulating uptake of CO 2 in mature, field-grown trees are affected by exposure to elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO 2] and air temperature. The experiment was conducted at the Flakaliden research site in northern Sweden. Twelve whole-tree chambers (WTCs) were used to impose combinations of [CO 2] and temperature treatments as predicted for the region in the year 2100. Shoot CO 2 gas exchange was measured continuously within the chambers, using shoot cuvettes. The effect of the climate change treatments on developing shoots was studied during their first growing season; the effect of the treatments on spring recovery and annual photosynthetic performance in 1 -year old shoots was also examined. The elevated temperature induced an earlier start and completion of the structural development of the current year’s shoots, as well as an earlier shift from negative to positive net carbon assimilation rate (NAR) by one to three weeks. The elevated CO 2 increased photosynthetic performance by 30 % in high season. Consequently, the current year’s shoots had assimilated their own mass in carbon 20 - 30 days earlier under the climate change conditions than under the current climatic conditions. For the 1 -year old shoots, an increase in the maximum photosynthetic rate of ~ 50 % was recorded, and the spring recovery of photosynthetic capacity was completed three to four weeks earlier than under the current climatic conditions. Multiple environmental variables constantly affect the NAR. A model incorporating the most important variables – light, temperature and vapour pressure deficit – was fitted to the data from the 1 -year old shoots. This linked changes in the carbon assimilation rate to each of the tested variables. An artificial neural network was used to reduce the noise present in the field data, and to benchmark the performance of the model. The climate change treatment increased the temperature optimum for gross carbon assimilation from 19. 7 to 24. 7 °C, and the model apparent quantum yield increased from 0. 042 to 0. 077 mol mol- 1. In total, the annual <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> increased by 84 %, compared to that under current conditions. The lengthening of the growing season increased annual <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> by 22 %. Finally, the influence of canopy processes on the rate of soil respiration and its carbon isotope signal (δ 13 C) were investigated.

40|$|Most nutrient-spiraling {{studies have}} focused on {{estimates}} of <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> (Ugross), which show that streams take up dissolved inorganic nutrients very efficiently. However, studies based on estimates of net uptake (Unet) emphasize that streams tend to be at biogeochemical steady state (i. e., Unet ≈ 0), at least on a time scale of hours. These findings suggest that streams can be highly reactive ecosystems but remain at short-term biogeochemical steady state if Ugross is counterbalanced by release (R), a process that remains widely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel approach to infer R by comparing Unet and Ugross estimated from ambient and plateau concentrations obtained from standard short-term nutrient additions along a reach. We used this approach to examine the temporal variation of R and its balance with Ugross in 2 streams with contrasting hydrological regime (i. e., perennial vs intermittent) during 2 years. We focused on the spiraling metrics of NH 4 + and soluble reactive P (SRP), essential sources of N and P in stream ecosystems. R differed substantially between the 2 streams. The perennial stream had a higher proportion of dates with R > 0 and a 2 × higher mean R than the intermittent stream for both nutrients. Despite these differences, the magnitude of R and Ugross tended to be similar for both nutrients within each stream, which lead to Unet ≈ 0 in most cases. A notable exception occurred for SRP in the intermittent stream, where R tended to be higher than Ugross during most of the winter period, probably because of desorption of P from stream sediments. Together, our findings shed light on the contribution of release processes to the dynamics of nutrient spiraling and support the idea that streams can be active ecosystems with high spiraling fluxes while simultaneously approaching short-term biogeochemical steady-state...|$|E

The occurrence and frequency of warm periods {{may be an important}} determinant of the magnitude of the ecosystem's carbon sink function, as they drive temperature-induced changes in respiration. Hot spells during the early portion of the growing season, when the photosynthetic apparatus of vascular plants is not fully developed, are shown to be more influential in creating positive mid-day surface-to-atmosphere net ecosystem CO 2 exchange fluxes than those occurring later in the season. In this work we also develop and present a multi-step bulk flux partition model to better account for tundra plant physiology and the specific light conditions of the arctic region. These conditions preclude the successful use of traditional partition methods that derive a respiration–temperature relationship from all nighttime data or from other bulk approaches that are insensitive to temperature or light stress. Nighttime growing season measurements are rare during the arctic summer, however, so the new method allows for temporal variation in the parameters describing both ecosystem respiration and <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> by fitting both processes at the same time. Much of the apparent temperature sensitivity of respiration seen in the traditional partition method is revealed in the new method to reflect seasonal changes in basal respiration rates. Understanding and quantifying the flux partition is an essential precursor to describing links between assimilation and respiration at different timescales, as it allows a more confident evaluation of measured net exchange over a broader range of environmental conditions. The growing season CO 2 sink estimated by this study is similar to those reported previously for this site, and is substantial enough to withstand the long, low-level respiratory CO 2 release {{during the rest of the}} year to maintain the site's CO 2 sink function on an annual basis...|$|E

During a period of 18 days between transects 5 / 6 and 11, a phytoplankton spring bloom developed in the Polar Frontal region. Upper water Cd concentrations were not depleted and ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 8 nM at about 10 m depth. These relatively high Cd concentrations are attributed to upwelling of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (0. 5 – 1. 2 nM in the core) in combination with low biological productivity (0. 2 to 0. 3 mg m− 3 chlorophyll-a, 0. 3 g C m− 2 d− 1). Total particulate Cd concentrations at 40 m depth were between 0. 02 and 0. 14 nM with the maximum in concentration in the Polar Frontal region. Most of the particulate Cd at this depth (85 – 94 %) was detected {{in the first phase}} of a sequential chemical leaching treatment which includes adsorbed Cd as well as Cd incorporated in algae. The Polar Frontal region was characterized by minima in Cd concentration and Cd/phosphate ratio of seawater at both transects; values were the lowest at transect 11 after development of the spring bloom which was dominated by diatoms. This decreasing Cd/phosphate ratio in seawater during spring bloom development was attributed to preferential Cd <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> which more than compensated the process of preferential Cd recycling.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} and {{adverse health}} effects of arsenic are widely known. It is generally accepted that sorption/desorption reactions with oxy-hydroxide minerals (iron, manganese) control the fate and transport of inorganic arsenic in surface waters through adsorption and precipitation-dissolution processes. In terrestrial environments with limited reactive iron, recent data suggest organoarsenicals are potentially important components of the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in near-surface environments. Elevated arsenic levels are common in South Texas from geogenic processes (weathering of As-containing rock units) and anthropogenic sources (a byproduct from decades of uranium mining). Sediments collected from South Texas show low reactive iron concentrations, undetectable in many areas, making oxy-hydroxide controls on arsenic unlikely. Studies have shown that eukaryotic algae isolated from arsenic-contaminated waters have increased tolerance to arsenate toxicity {{and the ability to}} uptake and biotransform arsenate. In this experiment, net uptake of arsenic over time by a freshwater cyanobacterium never previously exposed to arsenate was quantified as a function of increasing As concentrations and increasing N:P ratios. Toxic effects were not evident when comparing cyanobacterial growth, though extractions indicate accumulation of intracellular arsenic by the cyanobacterium. Increasing N:P ratios has minimal effect on net arsenate uptake over an 18 day period. However, cyanobacteria were shown to reduce arsenate at rates faster than the system can re-oxidize the arsenic suggesting <b>gross</b> arsenate <b>uptake</b> may be much higher.

Furthermore, a comparison between measurements under photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory conditions may give information about the contribution of photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration to the rate of gross CO 2 evolution at photosynthetic steady state. In tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv Moneymaker) leaves, drought stress decreases the rates of net and <b>gross</b> CO 2 <b>uptake</b> as well as CO 2 release from photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration in the light. However, the ratio of photorespiratory CO 2 evolution to gross CO 2 assimilation rises with water deficit. Also the contribution of re-assimilation of (photo) respiratory CO 2 to gross CO 2 assimilation increases under drought...|$|R
40|$|The use of δ 18 O- PO 4 {{analysis}} was assessed for the Grand River, a highly impacted river in Southern Ontario that receives inputs from 30 WWTPs. Significant nutrient inputs within the watershed {{have led to}} prolific aquatic plant growth, particularly within the central Grand River where this study is focused. Two of the largest WWTPs in the watershed fall within this region and these plants are {{in close proximity to}} each other (approximately 20 km apart). Various laboratory tests were carried out to assess the suitability of several DOM removal methods on Grand River water and WWTP effluent prior to mass spectrometric analysis with varying results. Sample analysis showed all river sites to possess δ 18 O- PO 4 values that were elevated relative to equilibrium. These sites are not equilibrium-controlled and, instead, possess δ 18 O- PO 4 signatures controlled by either source inputs, or isotopic fractionation. The second WWTP was shown to deliver PO 43 - that was elevated relative to equilibrium. WWTP effluent in this study displayed a large δ 18 O -PO 4 range, ranging from 10. 4 to 22. 9 ‰. Most of the variation in isotopic composition was found at the second plant, which had high soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and a range of 12. 5 to 22. 8 ‰ (n = 3). The first plant showed little variation with much lower SRP and a mean value of 11. 4 (SD ± 1. 0 ‰, n = 2). The elevated δ 18 O- PO 4 signatures collected from the second WWTP suggest that this plant is supplying the Grand River with isotopically distinct PO 43 -. This {{could be used as a}} way to establish the effect of the second WWTP on the downstream PO 43 - pool. Phosphate uptake and release by the epilithon and seston were measured using 32 P-PO 4 additions in recirculating beaker experiments. Two sites, one downstream of the first WWTP and one below the second WWTP, were assessed for gross and net PO 43 - uptake rates. The <b>gross</b> <b>uptake</b> rates at both sites were low (0. 04 to 0. 10 µg P cm- 2 h- 1), with long turnover times for the dissolved phosphate pool (12 to 40 h). Long uptake lengths (30 to 144 km) were measured, indicating low nutrient retention capabilities downstream of the two WWTPs. These significant P contributions appear to have large-scale effects on the river’s P-kinetics, limiting its ability to act as a net nutrient sink even in the more productive summer months. The biomass response below the WWTPs is insufficient to compensate for the elevated PO 43 - concentrations and low rates of PO 43 - uptake. Due to the limited use of δ 18 O -PO 4 analysis in river systems, no model exists for predicting the response of δ 18 O -PO 4 with distance downstream of a point source. Coupling rates of PO 43 - uptake and release with the effluent δ 18 O -PO 4 values provides such a model and generates guidance for future use of this method in lotic environments. WWTP “plume chases” were previously carried out in the Grand River, and involved measuring SRP at several sites downstream of the WWTP discharge points. SRP was used as a proxy for PO 43 - concentration in this study, and is operationally defined by what passes through a 0. 20 -µm membrane filter and is molybdate reactive. Best-fit estimates of PO 43 - uptake and release were determined using these plume chase events. The rates calculated using the 32 P-PO 4 uptake and release beaker experiments were up to 50 times lower than the best-fit parameters. This exercise illustrates the unsuitability of relaying estimates of P kinetics collected through beaker experiments to an ecosystem level. Model predictions for the river reach below the second WWTP show that effluent δ 18 O -PO 4 signatures should be observable many kilometres from the plant. Because of the unique mean isotopic composition observed for the second WWTP, sampling could occur at a variety of locations downstream to observe the effect of this plant on the river. The river reach below the first WWTP reduces the incoming P loads much quicker than the second reach, which is in part due to the much lower effluent SRP released by the first plant. It is still possible to isolate effluent derived δ 18 O-PO 4 values downstream of this plant. The return to equilibrium is projected to occur several kilometers from the first plant’s confluence, suggesting the applicability of this method in both stream reaches. It would appear δ 18 O -PO 4 could be a valuable tool for eliciting information on P cycling in effluent-impacted river ecosystems, with the Grand River possessing elevated but seemingly typical uptake lengths amongst eutrophic streams...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{contribute}} to the understanding eutrophication in large rivers with a detailed study of the Grand River, an impacted river in highly agricultural and urbanized Southern Ontario. It focuses on the role of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the distribution and abundance of benthic submersed macrophytes, which are important actors in river N and P cycles. Chapter 1 uses data from the Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network to examine seasonal, long term and spatial patterns in total P (TP), soluble reactive P (SRP), nitrate and nitrite (NO 3 - + NO 2 -) and ammonium (NH 4 +). The monitoring of many sites in the Grand River began in 1965, and I examine data from the period from 1965 to 2009. The monitoring program began prior to the Canada-USA ban on the use of phosphate in detergents, which came into effect in 1973, and also before major improvements to municipal waste water treatment. The phosphate ban is analyzed {{as an example of a}} whole-system nutrient manipulation experiment, and the seasonal and long term response of the river system, from headwaters to mouth, is examined. TP and SRP declined over the monitoring period, with the greatest response found in TP, which declined by 120 µg/l/y immediately downstream of the of the watershed’s largest treatment plant in the years 1972 - 1975. Thereafter, TP and SRP continued to decline over most of the lower river, with rates of decline in nutrient concentration accelerating with distance from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). NO 3 +NO 2 increased during the monitoring period in the upper portion of the river with the highest increase of 158 µg-N/l/y observed in the 10 year period of 1975 - 1985. It did not change in response to WWTP upgrades that occurred in the early 1970 s. WWTPs were a clear source of TP, SRP and NH 4 + to the river system, but not NO 3 +NO 2, and the continual increase in NO 3 +NO 2 was due to increases in diffuse sources. The seasonal and spatial data suggest that non-point sources of N and P dominate in the Grand River watershed. However, the largest WWTP in the region at Kitchener is an important source of nutrients, and was an especially large source of P prior to changes in detergent standards and wastewater treatment. The submersed macrophyte biomass in the Grand River was examined as a function of proximity to WWTPs in chapter 2. Spatial surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2009 on three reaches of approximately 10 km in length each, with two reaches having an upstream and downstream section, separated by a WWTP. Macrophyte patches were mapped, biomass was estimated, and plants were analyzed for N and P. Tissue N and P were compared to published thresholds for evidence of nutrient limitation. Biomass was greater downstream of the WWTPs than upstream in both reaches and both years, indicating that nutrient loading leads to increased biomass downstream, evidence that even in a heavily agricultural watershed, point sources have a demonstrable effect on macrophyte biomass. Depth was important in explaining some of the variation, while river width and orientation were not important. Even though macrophyte biomass was elevated downstream of the WWTPs, there was no strong evidence of N or P limitation upstream based on tissue concentrations and a laboratory determined critical nutrient threshold, and I hypothesize that the nutrient limitation affecting biomass occurs earlier in the growing season, before peak biomass. This suggests that the eutrophication process in rivers is distinct from that in lakes, and future work should view eutrophication in rivers in the context of seasonal succession. Drivers of seasonal and inter-annual variability in submersed macrophyte biomass were examined in chapter 3 with a multi-year, reach-scale spatial survey of three reaches near the WWTPs of Waterloo and Kitchener. Biomass differed among reaches, years and sites, and showed distinct seasonal patterns. The reach downstream of the WWTPs had the highest biomass, and peak biomass came soonest in the growing season, while the upstream reach had the smallest and latest peak biomass. Weather was significantly correlated to both the quantity and the time of the peak biomass, with higher temperatures associated with larger and earlier peak biomass and precipitation and higher flow associated with later and lower peak biomass. Therefore, the eutrophication response in rivers can depend on weather, and these drivers of variation should be accounted for when forecasting responses to future changes in nutrient loading. The effect of nitrogen discharged by WWTPs on the riverine submersed macrophyte community, and the suitability of macrophyte tissues as indicators of point source impact, were quantified in chapter 4 using δ 15 N as a tracer of WWTP effluent impact. Macrophytes and water for NO 3 - and NH 4 + concentration and isotope analysis was collected by canoe along two 10 km reaches of the river, up and downstream of two WWTPs. Macrophytes incorporated effluent nitrogen into their tissues downstream of the WWTPs, using effluent NH 4 + rather than NO 3 -. Impacts of the effluent on macrophytes can be traced as far as 10 km downstream, while daytime chemical evidence of the plume disappeared much sooner. The δ 15 N-NH 4 + value rapidly increased downstream of the WWTP, changing in one instance from + 13 ‰ to + 31 ‰ over 1 km, with macrophyte δ 15 N values changing from + 6 ‰ to + 24 ‰ over 5 km, while δ 15 N- NO 3 - values showed no such change. These data lead to the conclusion that riverine submersed macrophytes record the influence of WWTP effluent, specifically effluent NH 4 +, but that using two end-member mixing models to determine N sources would be inappropriate in such dynamic environments. Nitrogen cycle processes such as nitrification and denitrification are influenced by dissolved oxygen (DO) and rapid transformations occur in environments with strong DO gradients. Because development of dense macrophyte beds in eutrophic rivers has the potential to greatly alter daily oxygen cycling, producing strong redox potentials, macrophytes could influence microbial nitrogen cycling. In Chapter 5, nitrogen uptake by macrophytes using a 15 N-NH 4 + tracer and N 2 O production was investigated using in situ chamber incubations upstream and downstream of a WWTP. NH 4 + uptake occurred in chambers, while measurable net N 2 O production occurred in some chambers only. Neither N 2 O production nor NH 4 + uptake differed between chambers with and without PO 43 - addition, nor did they differ between light and dark treatments. NH 4 + uptake was higher at the upstream site, indicating that above the WWTP there was NH 4 + demand in the macrophyte community. NH 4 + uptake was a hyperbolic function of mean chamber NH 4 + concentration. Turnover time for the macrophyte N pool due to NH 4 + uptake was as long as 47 d, while the turnover of the dissolved NH 4 + pool was as rapid as 14 h. Because net uptake was a small fraction of <b>gross</b> <b>uptake,</b> calculated release rates were almost as high as uptake rates, again indicating rapid NH 4 + cycling. Eutrophication of rivers has elements that make it a process distinct from that in lakes. I showed that, in the Grand River, N and P were both high in concentration throughout the river, with a distinct increase downstream of the largest WWTPs in the watershed. The biomass of benthic submersed macrophytes was elevated below the WWTPs, but there was no evidence of nutrient limitation upstream during the time of peak biomass. Macrophyte biomass development followed a seasonal pattern, but was also influenced by seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns. Thus, the riverine eutrophication process has an important seasonal component, much as the plants themselves do, peaking in the summer and senescing in the fall. As part of the eutrophication response, macrophytes altered the chemical cycles of nutrients that fuel their growth. Though changes in benthic biomass themselves are part of riverine eutrophication, this thesis provides evidence that changes in macrophyte biomass produces chemical and ecological changes that are characteristic of increased trophic conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model of the}} grassland carbon cycle (CCGRASS) was developed to evaluate {{the long-term effects of}} different management strategies and various environmental conditions on carbon sequestration in a loam soil under permanent grassland in the Netherlands. The model predicted that the rate of increase in the amount of soil organic carbon will be greatest at low to moderate application rates of nitrogen (100 - 250 kg N/ha per year). This is because the annual <b>gross</b> photosynthetic <b>uptake</b> of CO 2 in permanent grassland is hardly influenced by the level of N supply. Since N shortage stimulates the growth of the unharvested plant parts (roots and stubble) the carbon supply to the soil is highest at low to moderate N application rates. The rate of increase in soil organic carbon will be greater under grazing than under mowing {{as a result of a}} greater amount of carbon added to the soil. Increase of atmospheric CO 2 concn may induce an increase in decomposition rate of soil organic matter due to simultaneously increased temperatures. At the same time, plant productivity and thus carbon supply to the soil will be stimulated due to the CO 2 -fertilization effect. Assuming a temperature increase of 3 degrees C if the present atmospheric CO 2 concn doubles, the model predicted that the combined effect of elevated CO 2 and temperature will slightly reduce the rate of increase in the amount of organic carbon in grassland soils compared to that under unchanged environmental conditions. There was 2 % less carbon sequestration by grassland at the end of a 100 year period as a result of these changes in environmental conditions. The separate effects of increased temperature or elevated CO 2 were 10 % less and 10 % more carbon storage after 100 years, resp...|$|R

In our analysis, these data streams consistently demonstrate a strong negative anomaly of the primary productivity during the summer of 2003. FLUXNET eddy-covariance data indicate that the drop in productivity was not primarily caused by high temperatures (‘heat stress’) but rather by limitation of water (drought stress) and that, contrary to the classical expectation about a heat wave, not only gross primary productivity but also ecosystem respiration declined by up to more than to 80 gCm_ 2 month_ 1. Anomalies of carbon and water fluxes were strongly correlated. While there are large between-site differences in water-use efficiency (WUE, 1 – 6 kgCkg_ 1 H 2 O) here defined as <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> divided by evapotranspiration (WUE 5 GPP/ET), the year-to-year changes in WUE were small (o 1 gkg_ 1) and quite similar for most sites (i. e. WUE decreased during the year of the heatwave). Remote sensing data from MODIS and AVHRR both indicate a strong negative anomaly of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in summer 2003, at more than five standard deviations of the previous years. The spatial differentiation of this anomaly follows climatic and land-use patterns: Largest anomalies occur in the centre of the meteorological anomaly (central Western Europe) and in areas dominated by crops or grassland. A preliminary model intercomparison along a gradient from data-oriented models to process-oriented models indicates that all approaches are similarly describing the spatial pattern of ecosystem sensitivity to the climatic 2003 event with major exceptions in the Alps and parts of Eastern Europe, but differed with respect to their interannual variability.

40|$|Stable carbon isotope {{fractionation}} (εp) {{was measured in}} four marine diatom and one dinoflagellate species of different cell sizes. Monospecific cultures were incubated under high-light and nutrient-replete conditions at 16 h : 8 h and 24 h : 0 h light/dark cycles in dilute batch cultures at six CO 2 concentrations, [CO 2,aq], ranging from ca. 1 to 38 μmol kg− 1. In all species, εp increased with increasing [CO 2,aq]. Among the diatoms, the degree of CO 2 -related variability in εp was inversely correlated with cell size. Isotopic fractionation in the dinoflagellate differed in several aspects {{from that of the}} diatoms, which may reflect both morphological and physiological differences between taxa. Daylength-related changes in instantaneous growth rate, defined as the rate of C assimilation during the photoperiod, affected εp to a similar or greater extent than differences in experimental [CO 2,aq] in three of the species tested. In contrast, the irradiance cycle had no effect on εp in 2 other species. With the exception of Phaeodactylum tricornutum, growth rate of all species declined below a critical [CO 2,aq]. At these concentrations, we observed a reversal in the CO 2 -related εp trend, which we attribute to a decline in carbon assimilation efficiency. Although uncatalyzed passive diffusion of CO 2 into the cell was sufficient to account for <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> in most treatments, our results indicate that other processes contribute to inorganic carbon acquisition in all species even at [CO 2,aq] > 10 μmol kg− 1. These processes may include active C transport and/or catalyzed conversion of HCO 3 − to CO 2 by carbonic anhydrase. A comparison of our results with data from the literature indicates significant deviations from previously reported correlations between εp and μ/[CO 2,aq], even when differences in cellular carbon content and cell geometry are accounted for...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of carbon}} fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere {{and the atmosphere}} is of scientific importance and also relevant to climate-policy making. Eddy covariance flux towers provide continuous measurements of ecosystem-level exchange of carbon dioxide spanning diurnal, synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales. However, these measurements only represent the fluxes at {{the scale of the}} tower footprint. Here we used remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to upscale gross primary productivity (GPP) data from eddy covariance flux towers to the continental scale. We first combined GPP and MODIS data for 42 AmeriFlux towers encompassing a wide range of ecosystem and climate types to develop a predictive GPP model using a regression tree approach. The predictive model was trained using observed GPP over the period 2000 – 2004, and was validated using observed GPP over the period 2005 – 2006 and leave-one-out cross-validation. Our model predicted GPP fairly well at the site level. We then used the model to estimate GPP for each 1 km × 1 km cell across the U. S. for each 8 -day interval over the period from February 2000 to December 2006 using MODIS data. Our GPP estimates provide a spatially and temporally continuous measure of gross primary production for the U. S. that is a highly constrained by eddy covariance flux data. Our study demonstrated that our empirical approach is effective for upscaling eddy flux GPP data to the continental scale and producing continuous GPP estimates across multiple biomes. With these estimates, we then examined the patterns, magnitude, and interannual variability of GPP. We estimated a <b>gross</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> between 6. 91 and 7. 33 Pg C yr− 1 for the conterminous U. S.

Global satellite-driven estimates of plant CO 2 <b>uptake</b> (<b>gross</b> primary productivity, GPP) {{have been found to}} not accurately account for Sahelian conditions, particularly the impact of canopy water stress. Here, we identify the main biophysical limitations that induce canopy water stress in Sahelian vegetation and evaluate the relationships between field data and Earth observation-derived spectral products for up-scaling GPP. We find that plant-available water and vapor pressure deficit together control the GPP of Sahelian vegetation through their impact on the greening and browning phases. Our results show that a multiple linear regression (MLR) GPP model that combines the enhanced vegetation index, land surface temperature, and the short-wave infrared reflectance (Band 7, 2105 - 2155 nm) of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite sensor was able to explain between 88 % and 96 % of the variability of eddy covariance flux tower GPP at three Sahelian sites (overall = 89 %). The MLR GPP model presented here is potentially scalable at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution.

This study aims to investigate the aluminium oxide nanoparticle induced acute toxicity on Ceriodaphnia dubia in a freshwater system.

Midday gross photosynthesis was 0. 5 to 1. 0 mmol m- 2 s- 1 by feather moss and 0. 5 to 2. 5 mmol m- 2 s- 1 by sphagnum moss. Photosynthesis by sphagnum moss was reduced by approximately 70 % at 0 °C, and reached a maximum rate at 8 °C. Nighttime CO 2 efflux, the sum of soil and moss respiration was 1 to 2. 5 mmol m- 2 s- 1 above feather moss and 0. 5 to 1. 5 mmol m- 2 s- 1 above sphagnum moss at moss temperatures of 0 to 15 °C. The higher rates of respiration at the feather moss sites probably reflected a greater below-ground input of carbon from black spruce, and the lower rates of photosynthesis were probably associated with shading by the black spruce canopy. Photosynthesis by moss accounted for 10 to 50 % of whole-forest <b>gross</b> CO 2 <b>uptake</b> measured simul-taneously by eddy covariance.

The annual rates of gross production and respiration by the forest were both around 8 t C ha− 1 yr− 1.
