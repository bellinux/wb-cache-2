In 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport; in 1744, Burton Mill was erected in Macclesfield; and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton. These three towns remained {{the centre of the}} English silk throwing industry until silk throwing was replaced by silk waste spinning. British enterprise also established silk <b>filature</b> in Cyprus in 1928. In England in the mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at Lullingstone Castle in Kent.

60|$|What {{happened}} {{with regard to}} raw silk is still more remarkable, and tends still more clearly to illustrate the effects of commercial servitude during its unchecked existence, and the consequences which may be made to arise from its sudden reformation. On laying open the trade, the article of raw silk was instantly enhanced to the Company full eighty per cent. The contract made for that commodity, wound off in the Bengal method, which used to sell for less than six rupees, or thirteen shillings, for two pounds' weight, arose to nine rupees, or near twenty shillings, and the <b>filature</b> silk was very soon after contracted for at fourteen.|$|E
60|$|During {{the time}} of their struggles for {{enlarging}} this losing trade, which they considered as a national object,--what in one point of view it was, and, {{if it had not been}} grossly mismanaged, might have been in more than one,--in this part it is impossible to refuse to the Directors a very great share of merit. No degree of thought, of trouble, or of reasonable expense was spared by them for the improvement of the commodity. They framed with diligence, and apparently on very good information, a code of manufacturing regulations for that purpose; and several persons were sent out, conversant in the Italian method of preparing and winding silk, aided by proper machines for facilitating and perfecting the work. This, under proper care, and in course of time, might have produced a real improvement to Bengal; but in the first instance it naturally drew the business from native management, and it caused a revulsion from the trade and manufactures of India which led as naturally and inevitably to an European monopoly, in some hands or other, as any of the modes of coercion which were or could be employed. The evil was present and inherent in the act. The means of letting the natives into the benefit of the improved system of produce was likely to be counteracted by the general ill conduct of the Company's concerns abroad. For a while, at least, it had an effect still worse: for the Company purchasing the raw cocoon or silk-pod at a fixed rate, the first producer, who, whilst he could wind at his own house, employed his family in this labor, and could procure a reasonable livelihood by buying up the cocoons for the Italian <b>filature,</b> now incurred the enormous and ruinous loss of fifty per cent. This appears in a letter to the Presidency, written by Mr. Boughton Rouse, now a member of your Committee. But for a long time a considerable quantity of that in the old Bengal mode of winding was bought for the Company from contractors, and it continues to be so bought to the present time: but the Directors complain, in their letter of the 12th of May, 1780, that both species, and particularly the latter, had risen so extravagantly that it was become more than forty per cent dearer than it had been fifteen years ago. In that state of price, they condemn their servants, very justly, for entering into contracts for three years,--and that for several kinds of silk, of very different goodness, upon averages unfairly formed, where the commodities averaged at an equal price differed from twenty to thirty per cent on the sale. Soon after, they formed a regular scale of fixed prices, above which they found they could not trade without loss.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the reasons for the different reactions among rural silk producers in Zhejiang and Jiangsu to agricultural modernization in the 1920 s and 1930 s:peasants in Zhejiang resisted improved silkworm eggs and continued to rear indigenous eggs, while those in Jiangsu pushed on with reforms. Why were the reactiosns in these two areas to the improved eggs different? In this paper, the causes are investigated from two perspectives:thosse who promoted the introduction of the improved silkworm eggs and those who rejected them. In Jiangsu, the processes of silk reeling and sericulture were separated. Sericulture in Jiangsu began to develop after the appearance of a modern silk industry in Shanghai. Jiangsu's peasants produced improved cocoons in order to provide the finer silk needed by modern <b>filatures.</b> On the other hand, in Zhejiang, the processes of silk reeling and sericulture were integrated and it was sericulture and siliworm egg production with were separated. Zhejiang's peasants did not produce cocoons for modern <b>filatures,</b> but silk reeling within the domestic production unit...|$|R

40|$|How do {{financial}} {{development and}} financial integration interact? We focus on Japan’s Great Recession after 1990 {{to study this}} question. Regional differences in banking integration affected how the recession spread across the country: financing frictions for credit-dependent firms were more severe in less integrated prefectures, which saw larger decreases in lending by nationwide banks and lower GDP growth. We explain these cross-prefectural differences in banking integration by reference to prefectures’ different historical pathways to financial development. After Japan’s opening to trade in the 19 th century, silk reeling emerged as the main export industry. The silk reeling industry depended heavily on credit for working capital but comprised many small firms that could not borrow directly from larger banks. Instead, silk merchants in Yokohama, the main export hub for silk, provided silk reelers with trade loans. Many regional banks in Japan were founded as local clearing houses for such loans, and regional banks continued to account for above-average shares in lending in the formerly silk-exporting prefectures long after {{the decline of the}} silk industry. Using the cross-prefectural variation in the number of silk <b>filatures</b> in 1895 as an instrument, we confirm that the post- 1990 decline was worse in prefectures where credit constraints were tightened through low levels of banking integration. Our findings suggest that different pathways to financial development can lead to long-term differences in de facto financial integration, even if there are no formal barriers to capital mobility between regions, {{as is the case in}} modern Japan...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Artisanal silk {{industry}} is a highly labour and land intensive activity ideally suited for economy like India. During medieval period, it was practiced as a dependable livelihood and Moghul Rulers were the patronizers. By 16 th Century, commercial production of silk was started in Bengal by Sultan Hussain Shah. From the mid of 17 th century, silk trade in India started flourishing since the demand for cheaper Bengal Silk began to rise in the European market. British traders realized that only low price of silk {{would not be enough}} to retain their market, and they introduced Piedmontese technology, though it was not suitable for Bengal economy at that point of time. After cessation of monopoly trade right, EEIC started selling off its <b>filatures,</b> thus spelling its gradual decline. After independence, attempts were made to transplant the temperate sericulture technology in the traditional silk producing states of India. West Bengal failed to bring the desired result both in domestic and export front, primary reason being large production of nistari multivoltine, while the export intensive bivoltine silk production is grossly ignored. During 2007 - 2012, the production of raw silk rose from 1660 MT to 1924 MT, but the employment generation showed an enormous decline from 3. 03 to 2. 71 lakhs. The primary analysis in the Malda district explains that number of man-days generated from different phases of silk-worm rearing activity influences the total income generation of the artisans. On the other hand, cost of machineries and loans taken by household farms have positive effects on income generation of the sericulture farms. The primary analysis also reveals that area of mulberry cultivation, educational background of family head and total man-days creation have an inverse impact on the level of average employment generation in rural sericulture, while rise in household size and numbers of male and female hired labour have positive impact on the level of employment generation in a sericulture family farm. Employment of women generates a superior impact on the nutritional and educational level of the children and this study shows that higher percentage of female members in the household, wage accruals to the hired female workers and family empowerment of female members raise the gender pre-dominance of the sericulture farms.

40|$|The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (CSPFTZ) {{has been}} {{established}} on September 29 th 2013 in Shanghai. Shanghai has been the center of many historical events. In the 19 th century, Shanghai was opened up {{to the outside world}} and forced to outside trade relations due to the Nanking Treaty of 1842 after the First Opium War (1839 - 1842) and was selected as a new port: the ‘Shanghai International Settlement’. The British, American and French settled in Shanghai and after 100 years Shanghai developed as the largest foreign trade port in China. Meanwhile, during the first Sino-Japanese War of 1895, China was mauled by a strong, Western influenced Japan. Attempts to reform China into a modern nation failed but after the 1911 Revolution, Shanghai emerged as a center of modern activities. The population doubled between 1895 and 1910 from 245, 675 to 501, 541 people as many Chinese were attracted by the city. During World War I (1914 - 1918) many people left while the diminished supply of Chinese export goods led to a higher demand of these export goods. Especially in the 1920 s and 1930 s, Shanghai grew as many silk <b>filatures,</b> cotton mills, and chemical works emerged. In the 1930 s, Shanghai’s Port served as the main shipping center in the Far East; the city was seen as a cosmopolitan city. However, in 1937 Japan bombed Shanghai and occupied parts of China again, which lasted until 1945. People lived under brutal circumstances under the occupation of Japan and the conditions to develop into a cosmopolitan city moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. In 1949, the CCP, led by Mao Zedong, took power and focused on rural regions resulting in neglected cities; the nation controlled Shanghai and the city was forced to dispose of its cosmopolitan life. However, when Mao Zedong died in 1976, the balance of power changed: Hua Guofeng established the ‘Open Door’ policy in 1977 before Deng Xiaoping returned to power in 1978. The new policy led to the beginning of its modernization process and several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were established mainly to attract foreign direct investment. 	Since the opening up until 1997, China attracted billions of foreign investment (US dollars) and by the mid- 1990 s, the economy moved away from a command economy to a functioning market economy. After 1978, China’s modernization process took off really quickly and created a gap between South China including its coastal regions and North-East China as the South and its coastal areas are developing much faster. Therefore, China can be divided into two different phases of modernization according to Rostow’s Five-Stages of Growth (1960). The South and its coastal regions can be assigned to the final phase of modernization while the North-East part of China can be assigned to phase three. The SEZs which have been established since 1978 are particular geographic regions in countries used to encourage export services, industry, and manufacturing. In China, initially four SEZs were established in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen and Shantou to test the new policies and new institutions for the market-oriented economy in order to improve China’s economy. The role SEZs, and especially Shenzhen, played in China’s modernization process was quite apparent as average annual growth has been 9. 4 percent since the 1980 s: the SEZs boost China’s economy and moved towards a more technology-intensive and higher-value economy. 34 years later, on 29 th September 2013, a new SEZ was established in Pudong, Shanghai: the CSPFTZ. The CSPFTZ {{has been established}} to enhance China’s economic position globally and to develop a new, replicable financial and administrative system which can be implemented in every region of the country. Nevertheless, the privileged status of ‘special’ is diminished since there are already many SEZs in China. However, as analysis shows, the zone operates differently from the majority of the SEZs which enables the CSPFTZ to offer enough advantages to attract foreign investors to be successful. The chances of success nonetheless depend on the government. The government encourages so many aspects and is experimenting with so many measures that the chance of success is questioned. But, if the government is able to achieve its aims, the CSPFTZ can be successful and could contribute to China’s South and coastal regions’ modernization process as the leading sectors shift towards more durable consumer goods and services in Rostow’s final phase. This thesis mainly compared the new Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone of September 2013 with China's previous most important Special Economic Zones...|$|R

50|$|Jardines were a major {{importer}} and {{exporter of}} {{all manner of}} goods prior to the 1937 Japanese invasion of China. Tea and silk ranked {{high on the list}} of commodities exported. As long ago as 1801, precursor firms to Jardines had secured the first licences from the East India Company to exports teas to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land and when the East India Company's trade monopoly was overturned in 1834, the firm lost no time in expanding its tea business. By the 1890s Jardines were exporting large quantities of Keemun. Soochong, Oolong, Gunpowder, and Chun Mee tea. Ocean steamers laden with these cargoes departed from Fuzhou and Taiwan, as well as from the firms godowns (warehouses) on the Shanghai Bund bound for Europe, Africa, and America. Silk played a prominent role as a commodity during Jardine's first century of operation.
