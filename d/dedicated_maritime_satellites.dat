40|$|A new {{low-profile}} {{variable pitch}} angle cylindrical helical antenna employing a copper strip as impedance transformer is proposed in this paper. Under the circumstance {{of a limited}} antenna height, the circular polarization performance of the antenna has been enhanced by changing the pitch angle and the input impedance matching has been improved by adjusting the copper strip match stub. The design method of the proposed antenna is given. The optimal antenna structure for INMARSAT application has been fabricated and measured. The measured results show that in the whole <b>maritime</b> <b>satellite</b> communication work band the VSWR is less than 1. 2, its antenna gain is higher than 9 [*]dBi, and the axial ratio is lower than 2. 5 [*]dB. The experimental results have a good agreement with the simulations. The proposed antenna is compact and easy tuning. It provides a promising antenna element for <b>maritime</b> <b>satellite</b> communication applications...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. This thesis considers the Navy's {{use of the}} Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), International <b>Maritime</b> <b>Satellite</b> (INMARSAT) network, and the International Telecommunications Satellite (INTELSAT) system with emphasis on the future utilization of C, X, and Ku-band Super High Frequency (SHF) communications in the Navy's satellite communications (SATCOM) architecture. It evaluates all three systems addressing critical issues such as anti-jamming capability, survivability, timeliness, availability, interoperability, and capacity. All three satellite systems currently {{have a place in}} the Navy's SATCOM architecture. This thesis focuses on the advantages and disadvantages that the DSCS satellite network offers the Navy and recommends using DSCS for low capacity protected circuits and high capacity unprotected service in the future. Additionally, a recommendation is made for a future high capacity DSCS follow-on satellite. This thesis also addresses the advantages and disadvantages that INMARSAT and INTELSAT offer the Navy and recommends that these systems be used as surge communication mediums in the future.

40|$|In recent years, European {{maritime}} {{countries have}} {{had to deal with}} new situations involving the traffic of illegal vessels. In order to tackle such problems, systems are required that can detect relevant anomalies such as unauthorised fishing or irregular migration and related smuggling activity. The OSIRIS project aims to contribute to a solution to these problems with the use of large scale data provided by satellite missions (Sentinel, Cosmo-SkyMed, EROS). Optical/SAR data and system Integration for Rush Identification of Ship models (OSIRIS) is a European Space Agency project launched in March 2016, with the primary purpose of developing a software platform <b>dedicated</b> to <b>maritime</b> surveillance. The platform will be in charge of: (i) collecting maritime remote sensing data provided by satellite missions such as Sentinel- 1, Sentinel- 2, Cosmo-SkyMed and EROS-B, and (ii) processing the acquired data in order to detect and classify seagoing vessels. A main goal within OSIRIS is to develop computational imaging procedures to process Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical data returned by satellite sensors. We propose a system to automatically detect and recognise all the vessels within in a given area; the <b>maritime</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery will be processed to extract visual informative features of candidate vessels and to assign an identification label to each vessel...|$|R

30|$|Ocean network {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most important research topics in the field of ocean information technology in the future. It plays an important role in vessel communication, ocean observation and military security. Currently, the main communication means of ocean vessels include HF and VHF radio communication [1 – 3], onboard laser communication [4], cellular mobile network [5], and <b>maritime</b> <b>satellite</b> communication [6]. HF and VHF radio communication are vulnerable to atmospheric interference, thus having blind coverage areas and poor confidentiality. Its communication requires a predetermined frequency which makes it impossible to provide network service in large-scale ocean area. At present, it is only suitable for the internal communication among fleet of vessels and the directional communication to the seashore base station. Laser communication has many advantages, such as high bandwidth and confidentiality, but it is not suitable for providing general oceanic network communication services due to the targeting problem. Because of high cost of setting up the ocean base station, the cellular network cannot provide the network coverage for medium or long distance of sea area and frequent network data transmission will lead to high communication cost. Currently, <b>maritime</b> <b>satellite</b> {{communication is}} a good way of ocean network communication. However, the high price of terminals and communication expenses prohibit it from large-scale application.|$|R

50|$|This new ESRO policy, {{negotiated}} in 1973, gave the organisation overall {{responsibility for the}} development of the European Ariane launcher. This task was entrusted to CNES.

This agreement made funding easier and more flexible for the contributing nations which led to a doubling of the organisation's overall budget. ESRO also participated in the International Ultraviolet Explorer mission with NASA under these policy guidelines.|$|R
