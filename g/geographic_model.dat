Since the quality of such applications is largely related to the richness and completeness of their data, it becomes imperative to develop adaptable and persistent storage systems, able {{to make use of}} several sources of information as well as enabling the fastest possible response from them. This work will create a shared and extensible <b>geographic</b> <b>model,</b> able to retrieve and store information from the major spatial sources available.

40|$|Integration of {{geographic}} information {{has increased in}} importance because of new possibilities arising from the interconnected world and the increasing availability {{of geographic}} information. Ontologies support the creation of conceptual models and help with information integration. In this paper, we propose a way to link the formal representation of semantics (i. e., ontologies) to conceptual schemas describing information stored in databases. The main result is a formal framework that explains a mapping between a spatial ontology and a geographic conceptual schema. The mapping of ontologies to conceptual schemas is made using three different levels of abstraction: formal, domain, and application levels. At the formal level, highly abstract concepts are used to express the schema and the ontologies. At the domain level, the schema is regarded as an instance of a generic data model. At the application level, {{we focus on the}} particular case of geographic applications. We also discuss the in¯uence of ontologies in both the traditional and geographic systems development methodologies, with an emphasis on the conceptual design phase.

40|$|Optical access {{networks}} provide a future proof platform {{for a wide}} range of services, and today, several operators are deploying fibre to the home (FTTH) networks. Installing an FTTH infrastructure, however, involves very high investment cost. Therefore, a good estimation of the investment cost is important for building a successful business strategy and, consequently, to speed up the FTTH penetration. In this paper, for calculating the amount of cable and fibre in the outside plant together with the associated civil works, and the number of required network elements, two different approaches are investigated: (1) geometric modelling of the fibre plant based on approximate mathematical <b>models</b> and (2) <b>geographic</b> <b>modelling</b> of the fibre plant based on map-based geospatial data. The results obtained from these two approaches can then be used as input for preliminary investment cost calculations and/or techno-economic evaluations. Compared to more complex and accurate <b>geographic</b> <b>modelling,</b> we verify that especially with uneven population density and irregular street system, simple geometric models do not provide accurate results. However, if no geospatial data is available or a fast calculation is desired for a first estimation, geometric models definitely have their relevance. Based on the case studies presented in this paper, we propose some important guidelines to improve the accuracy of the geometric models by eliminating their main distortion factors...|$|R

As the size and complexity of such documents and their schemas grow, techniques and rules for designing and creating such documents become indispensable. This paper introduces a method for mapping geographic conceptual specifications (defined in OMT-G) to GML Schema. Our method avoids semantic or structural losses and provides redundancy-free data. It also reduces the use of integrity constraints and improves the nesting of XML elements in the resulting schema. We have implemented the method in order to automate the process of obtaining the target schema from the original <b>geographic</b> <b>model.</b> Experimental results show that spatial and non-spatial queries over the GML documents created from schemas generated using our method are more efficient than on documents created with a traditional, direct mapping process. ...|$|E
