5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E
5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHead {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell cancers {{are among the}} most aggressive. Their incidence and mortality rates are relatively lower in Middle Africa than worldwide, but in Gabon, these rates tend to be 2 – 3 fold higher than in neighboring countries. The main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco consumption. However, in the last decades, there was cumulated evidence that <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> were a significant risk factor, particularly for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. In Gabon, as elsewhere in Africa, assessment of these 3 risk factors need to be improved to determine their respective {{role in the development of}} head and neck squamous cell cancers. The potential differences in alcohol/tobacco consumption habits as well as in infectious ecology between developing and developed countries can make it difficult to transpose current data on this issue. Determining the respective role of alcohol/tobacco consumption and <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> in the development of head and neck squamous cell cancers is crucial for the management of these cancers that could become a serious public health issue in Gabon. <b>Human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> are not only a risk factor but also a biomarker with promising clinical potential for the follow-up of head and neck squamous cell cancers potentially able to select an adequate treatment. Then, assessing the epidemiological impact of <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> in Gabon and in all of Africa would prove useful for the clinical follow-up of head and neck squamous cell cancers, and would also provide essential data to plan a global prevention strategy against head and neck squamous cell cancers due to <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses...</b>|$|R

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus,</b> which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} is {{the gold}} standard method for accurate microbial and viral typing. However, DNA sequencing techniques have been facing limitations in typing of <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> when the specimen harbors multiple genotypes and yields nonspecific amplification products, resulting in nonspecific and noninterpretable sequence data. To address these limitations we have developed a type-specific multiple sequencing primer DNA-sequencing method. This new strategy is suitable for sequencing and typing of samples harboring different genotypes (co-infections with multiple genotypes) and yielding nonspecific amplifications, thus {{eliminating the need for}} nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), stringent PCR conditions, and cloning. The new approach has also proved useful for amplicons containing low PCR yield or subdominant types, avoiding reperforming of amplifications. We have applied the multiple sequencing primer method for genotyping of clinically relevant <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> in a clinical test panel by using a combined pool of seven type-specific sequencing primers for HPV- 6, - 11, - 16, - 18, - 31, - 33, and - 45. Furthermore, we introduced a sequence pattern recognition approach when there was a plurality of genotypes in the sample to facilitate typing of more than one target DNA in the sample.

5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E

25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> {{infection}} is an infection by <b>human</b> <b>papillomavirus</b> (HPV). Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously. In some people, an HPV infection persists {{and results in}} warts or precancerous lesions. The precancerous lesions {{increase the risk of}} cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, or throat. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV with two types, HPV16 and HPV18, accounting for 70% of cases. Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers are also linked to HPV. HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.|$|E

40|$|Infections with high-risk <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> (hrHPV) {{contribute}} to cervical carcinoma. The cdk inhibitor and tumor sup-pressor p 16 INK 4 A is consistently upregulated in cervical carcinoma cells {{for reasons that}} are poorly understood. We report here that downregulation of p 16 INK 4 A gene expression in three different cervical carcinoma cell lines reduced expression of the E 7 oncogene, suggesting a positive feedback loop involving E 7 and p 16 INK 4 A. p 16 INK 4 A depletion induced cellular senescence in HeLa but not CaSki andMS- 751 cervical carcinoma cells. IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates that the cdk inhibitor p 16 INK 4 A, frequently used as surrogate marker for transforming infections by <b>human</b> <b>papillomaviruses</b> of the high-risk group, is required for high-level expression of the E 7 oncoproteins of HPV- 16, HPV- 18, and HPV- 45 in cervical carcinoma cells.
