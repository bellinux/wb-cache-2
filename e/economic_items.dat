While some archaeological correlates of the salt trade such as ropes, skins and plant material may not preserve, stones used to sharpen axes, and metal axes used to extract and shape salt would likely preserve. The remains of pack animals used to transport salt may also preserve. Overall, the salt trade would leave a thin footprint in the archaeological record.

40|$|The {{national}} {{picture is}} one of difference between the lives of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians across nearly all the Census dimensions. The Indigenous population is significantly younger and growing at a faster rate; the <b>economic</b> <b>items</b> reveal broad-scale division; cultural differences are apparent around language and family life and there are discernible disconnections across the spatial dimensions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous lives. But this aggregate perspective does not tell the full diversity story. An Australian Indigenous population analytical base, with its national patterns and trends, obscures the broader diversity of Indigenous lives. Standard disaggregation to state and territory level elicits the same limitations. While Indigenous lives are obviously lived within national and state and territory boundaries, it is their locations in specific places and spaces that most influence their shape, context and circumstances. Geographical place, {{at the level of}} the town, the region, the sector of the city or the community, is central to the conditions and milieus in which those lives are lived. For most Indigenous Australians, such locations are urban. While media and public understandings are firmly directed towards discrete Indigenous communities, with an emphasis on the remote, most reside outside such places. Sydney is the place with the largest Indigenous population and the primary sites of current population increase are the cities of Brisbane, Broome and Coffs Harbour, not remote communities in the Northern Territory or Western Australia. Yes, Indigenous people remain significantly more likely to live in remote areas than other Australians, but nearly a third live in metropolitan areas, nearly half reside in regional areas and only a little over one quarter live their lives in remote sites. Indigenous individuals, families and communities have been urban residents since early colonial times and overall population trends indicate an ongoing Indigenous drift to the larger urban centres.

40|$|This {{research}} was foregrounded by my 2002 exhibition Weevil Rugs of New Guinea, a fictionally based body of work, which through motif, technique, materiality and allusions {{to form and}} function, made reference and paid homage to mat makers/textile artists in Canada, Papua New Guinea and Australia. The use of insect motifs was underpinned by my familiarity with insects (through a prior natural resource management degree) and an appreciation that the insect motif could sustain a long term examination both as a design base and {{as a vehicle to}} critique arbitrary standards and preconceived notions. But what of other textile makers who use insect motifs? How do they come to the use of entomological designs? In particular, how do women of Papua New Guinea, the country in which my weevil (the genus Eupholus) was found, adopt such imagery? What does this indicate about them and their art practices? How could the practices of the Western artist and the Morobean women of Papua New Guinea be documented both visually and in a written form to illustrate the parallel practices of mat making that incorporate entomological motifs? This research addresses these questions, and seeks to expand the understanding of the paradigms of art and science, by exploring the creative processes of two similar, yet culturally radically different, sets of textile practices, both of which employ entomological imagery: my practice as a Western textile artist and the practices of Papua New Guinean (from Morobe province) makers of stitched Pandanus mats. Based on an a priori assumption that textiles are valid sites for artistic expressions that include culturally appropriate decorative motifs, often of a symbolic nature but also conceptual imagery, the research behind Distilling the Weevilness of Weevil focuses on the developments and processes common to both practices. While the research is informed by the extant literature on women’s material culture in Papua New Guinea, as well as an overview of mat and entomological culture, in fact stitched Pandanus mats of the Huon Gulf are not well represented in the museums of the world or in documentation by the first expatriates (missionaries) to live in this area. Since the missionaries‟ arrival in the 1880 s, and despite several independent museum expeditions, only a handful of mats and rain capes (approximately 25) have been collected from this area. Similarly, with the exception of brief mentions in relation to mats as <b>economic</b> <b>items</b> in the trade cycles of Tami (Huon Gulf) and Tuam Islands (Siassi), the sites of the current research, the literature and primary source information is scanty. Mat making persists in these communities. This research documents the extent of historical continuity and current practices through the interrogation of histories, ideas and imagery coupled with photo-imagery of historical mats from the region. Interestingly, only one group of Morobean mat makers used an entomological motif as part of its lexicon. Nevertheless, the majority of all designs referenced nature intimately and reflected the overarching aims of the science/art paradigm. Photographs reveal the rarely documented processes of stitched Pandanus mat making from the villages of Malesiga, Yaga Settlement and Bukaua. As part of the studio practice component of this research, formal aesthetic qualities in hooked mats, with relation to design qualities of the stitched Pandanus mats of the Huon Gulf and Siassi, were explored. Mat hooking, thought to have originated on the eastern seaboard of North America as early as the 1850 s, {{is considered to be a}} true North American art form. Because this researcher’s ancestry can be traced to Eastern Canada, similar historical parameters are maintained between the two research focus groups. A number of strategies were employed in gathering data on the creative practices and the designs of the Morobean stitched mats. Of central importance have been studies of archived and museum objects combined with field work with contemporary Morobean mat makers. These initiatives have lead to the development of the resultant body of exhibition work that not only documents research efforts in terms of formal aesthetic experiments as well as literature research, but also presents the findings of the research as a visual discourse on creative process. The potential for future research, with respect to continuing investigations into stitched Pandanus mats but also into the broader categories of female material culture in Papua New Guinea, the teaching of textiles both in the developed and developing world as well as the further development of a personal artistic practice, is canvassed in the final chapter...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} in Qiyun Mountain, Anhui Province from the commencement of November, 2012, {{to the end of}} May, 2013. Qiyun Mountain is well known for its long history of Taoism, its unique Danxian landscapes, numerous cliff inscriptions, and ancient Huizhou style of villagescapes. This thesis attempts to compare perceptions of tourism impacts from the perspectives of different stakeholders’ and their attitudes towards future tourism development and their suggestions for further sustainable tourism. While any application of Western literature on stakeholders’ perceptions of tourism impact {{in the context of a}} rural Taoism community in China may have limitations and currently many studies in the Chinese academic literature have focussed primarily on local communities and economic impacts, this study tried to obtain a grounded understanding of daily realities by adopting an ethnographic research method to collect data. This approach involved ‘Semi-structured interviews’, ‘Participant observation’, ‘Conversation’, ‘Field notes’, ‘Photography’, ‘Using secondary documentation’, and formal ‘Questionnaires’. Analysis of the interviews was based on thematic analysis methods and textual analysis software, while an analysis of survey data was undertaken using SPSS 20. 0. This thesis has six main research objectives. The first is to investigate visitors’ perceptions of tourism impacts in Mt Qiyun, and their evaluations of Qiyun tourism. The second objective is to investigate the views of residents who live in ‘below mountain’ villages, and discover their attitudes to tourism development. The third objective therefore, investigates tourism impacts from the Qiyun People’s perceptions, that is, the residents who live in the mountain village that until now has been the core of the attraction. The fourth objective is to investigate the nature and degree of tourism impacts in Mt Qiyun from local governmental officials’ perceptions. The next objective is to simply compare the different perceptions and attitudes towards tourism impacts. Finally the thesis draws on the evidence and speculates in the context of the wider literature the extent to which it is possible to generalize from the study to a wider conceptualization of tourism impacts on Chinese communities. As outlined above, four stakeholder groups were chosen to be researched, and were classified as ‘residents who live on the mountain’, ‘ residents who live below the mountain’, ‘visitors’, ‘Government officials’. Thus, a large number of samples were obtained in this thesis. The total number of semi-structured interview from 4 different stakeholders reached 124 respondents, comprising 36 respondents from residents below the mountain, 28 respondents from residents on the mountain, 40 respondents from visitors, and 20 respondents from government officials. In addition three questionnaires were sent to three groups, namely residents below the mountain (n= 768), residents on the mountain (n= 75), visitors (n= 1391). The findings firstly provide an insight into how stakeholders perceive tourism and its impacts in Mt Qiyun from environmental, social-cultural and economic perspectives. It is found that government officials are more likely to focus on the positive environmental impacts than other three stakeholders. Respondents drawn from the two resident groups both clearly realized the benefits and costs which tourism had brought to the local community. The mountain residents who frequently have contact with visitors mentioned the negative impacts created by a number of visitors’ activities. With reference to social-cultural impact, it can be seen that residents on the mountain are the most affected group when compared with the other three stakeholders. Both government and visitors have a low awareness of social-cultural impacts; and because visitors only stay a couple of hours, it is really difficult for them to deeply experience how tourism influences local life, culture, and value systems. For most government officials, they lived in Xiuning country, and just worked in Qiyun town; and most travel to the mountain only a few times per year. When assessing the residents below the mountain it was found that this group have more favourable perceptions than government and visitor groups, but lower than the residents on the mountain. Regarding economic impacts, except for residents below the mountain, stakeholders confirmed the positive role of tourism in benefiting the village and local area economically. Residents below the mountain showed their dissatisfaction over many <b>economic</b> <b>items,</b> and strongly agreed with a view that tourism development leads to an ‘unbalanced industry structure’, ‘unfairness of income distribution’, ‘higher living expenses’ and ‘increases the income gaps between rich and poor’. Secondly, all stakeholders expressed dissatisfaction for different reasons about the current state of Qiyun tourism. Yet all hope the mountain could be developed yet further rather than simply sustain the current level of tourism activities. It suggested that to sustain rural community tourism, every stakeholder needs to be considered; especially those of local residents. Residents should be encouraged to not only enjoy participation in the sharing of tourism economic benefits, but also have some opportunities to say something in the decision making process. The thesis also describes a ‘social harmony’ model in the Qiyun Mountain area with respect to social-cultural, political, economic and environmental issues...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the printing industry in Paris between 1570 and 1590. These years represent a relatively under-researched period in the history of Parisian print. This period is of importance because of an event in 1572 – the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, and an event in 1588 – the Day of the Barricades and the subsequent exit from Paris of Henry III. This thesis concerns itself with the two years prior to 1572 and two years after 1588 in order to provide context, but the two supporting frames of this investigation are those important events. This thesis attempts to assess what effect those events had upon the printing industry in the foremost print centre of both France and Western Europe. With the religious situation in Paris quietened was there any concrete change in the 1570 s and 1580 s regarding the types of books printed in Paris? Was there any attempt to exploit this religious stability by pursuing the ‘retreating’ Protestant confession, or did the majority of printers turn away from confessional arguments and polemical literature? What were the markets for Paris books: were they predominantly local or international? The method by which these questions have been addressed is with a bibliometric analysis of the output of the Paris print shops. This statistical approach allows one to address the entire corpus of a city’s output and allows both broad surveys of the data in terms of categorisation of print, but also narrower studies of individual printers and their output. As such this approach allows the printing industry of Paris to be surveyed and analysed {{in a way that would}} otherwise be impossible. This statistical approach also allows the books to be seen as an <b>economic</b> <b>item</b> of industrial production instead of purely a culture item of artistic creation. This approach enhances rather than reduces the significance of a book’s cultural importance as it allows the researcher to fully appreciate the achievement and investment of both finance and time that was necessary for the completion of a well printed book.
