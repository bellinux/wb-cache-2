5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for coverage of nonfiction {{books on the}} C-SPAN networks originated with C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb's frustration {{with the lack of}} attention that authors receive on television, which led initially {{to the creation of the}} author interview program Booknotes. As Lamb related in a 2003 interview, [...] "It used to drive me absolutely crazy when an author would appear on a talk show and come and go before I even had a chance <b>to</b> determine if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the book." ...|$|R

5000|$|His work in Russia enabled him, in 1905, to meet Leo Tolstoy, {{and they}} talked of politics, {{literature}} and morality. Reportedly Tolstoy {{asked him why he}} had learnt Russian and received the reply, [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Anna Karenina in the original." [...] Tolstoy insisted on the languages Williams spoke being enumerated. The interview was published in the Manchester Guardian on 9 February 1905, but for Williams the meeting was not a success. He was disappointed with Tolstoy’s withdrawal from the world of political reality and the consequences of contemporary events. A believer in individual liberty, Williams found himself sympathetic towards the left-wing reformers, the Cadets and Liberals.|$|R

50|$|Donald Goddard Wing {{was born}} on August 18, 1904 in Athol, Massachusetts. From a young age Wing possessed a passion for accumulating literature, which he {{maintained}} throughout his life; as a child he “collected the Smart Set and other ‘little magazines,’” in college he “added a book a day to his collection,” and once upon returning from overseas he smuggled in {{a copy of the}} banned book Ulysses. Upon graduation of college Wing stated that, “all the seniors were asked what they dreamed of doing, and <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> second-hand book catalogues.” Wing’s passion for collecting and cataloguing printed materials contributed to his desire to complete his most famous work, his Short-Title Catalogue.|$|R
50|$|I {{got into}} {{woodworking}} {{about two years}} ago, through a buddy of mine who I used to skate with every day—he turned into a woodworker. So he gave me this scrap box of wood, and, basically, <b>I</b> just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something with it…make something with it. It just definitely started consuming me like skating did. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> about it, you know? Go {{on the internet and}} watch videos about it, and just learn anything and everything I could about woodworking. The first thing I ever made was a bench, and that's, kinda, what I've been making ever since. the cool thing about working with Product (RED) is just by doing the two things that I love, I'm also able to help people.|$|R

500|$|Trish {{suffered}} from depression and {{was introduced to}} Christianity by stable owners, Keith and Sam, who invited the Primus family to join them at church on a Sunday. Initially, Primus was reluctant but Trish convinced him. Primus remarked {{that it was a}} case of [...] "well church is the last place we'd go, but why not?" [...] The church was more [...] "laid-back" [...] than the one that Primus attended as a child and he, with the rest of his family, became regular churchgoers in 2001. Trish's depression was lifted and Primus converted to Christianity later that year. [...] "In my heart I felt whole and complete, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible at every opportunity."

5000|$|In other cases, scanlation {{groups are}} formed {{to get around}} {{perceived}} or actual censorship in the official translation or {{in the decision to}} obtain the series license. [...] "Caterpillar" [...] of former Caterpillar's Nest scanlation group, in reference to erotic content that his group released, stated that [...] "I started doing scanlations because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> certain manga and I knew they didn't stand a snowflake's chance in hell of ever getting an official English translation." [...] In the yaoi fandom, commercially published explicit titles are often restricted to readers aged 18 or above, and there is a tendency for booksellers to stock BL, but also insist that more of it is shrink-wrapped and labeled for adult readers. Andrea Wood has suggested that teenage yaoi fans seek out more explicit titles using scanlations.|$|R
