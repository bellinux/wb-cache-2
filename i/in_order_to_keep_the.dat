5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> moral law. A dutiful will {{is thus a}} special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This {{is not to say}} that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera.

The attack was intended as a preventive action <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against the overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|After her {{commissioning}} on 1 May 1912, Oldenburg conducted {{sea trials}} in the Baltic. On 17 July, she {{was assigned to}} the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sisters. After individual ship training exercises, she joined I Squadron maneuvers and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> fleet closer to Germany. Oldenburg {{and the rest of the}} fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peace-time training.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> film's plot a secret.

5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors {{had no idea of}} the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E

After Florida and Georgia accepted the renovations, agreeing to play the rivalry game in Athens, Georgia during the renovations, Jacksonville investors proposed expanding the renovation plan {{in order to attract}} a National Football League team. The price tag was revised upward—to $121 million—and the city successfully attracted a team. Shortly after Jacksonville was awarded its new franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—the final plans were unveiled.

Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder {{they should have been}} protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was reinforced}} {{with the arrival}} of Emden and Nürnberg; the ships then departed the central Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August the captain of Emden, Commodore Karl von Müller, persuaded von Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding. On 14 August, the East Asia Squadron departed Pagan for Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The ships again coaled after their arrival on 20 August. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> German high command informed, von Spee detached Nürnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. Nürnberg brought back news of the Allied capture of the German colony at Samoa on 29 August.

5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved {{around a large}} mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such.

The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E
