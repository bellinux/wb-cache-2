5|$|In 2001, {{director}} Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American {{soldier in}} the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> soldier, who fights {{his way out of}} a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.|$|E

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over obstacles, and shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that can be manipulated to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The Engineers try to flee Site F, using Briggs and {{the hostages}} as human shields. Fisher, {{disguised}} as an Air Force hostage, helps <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men. Sadiq escapes on foot, and Fisher disarms and seriously wounds him. Sadiq boasts {{that he has}} already won; if he dies twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S. {{and if he is}} tried, he will leak U.S. information. Although Fisher spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq.|$|E

5|$|A Japanese radio drama {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid, {{directed}} by Shuyo Murata and written by Motosada Mori, was produced {{shortly after the}} release of the original PlayStation game. 12 episodes were aired, from 1998 to 1999 on Konami's CLUB db program. The series was later released on CD as a two volume series. Set after the events of the PlayStation game, Snake, Meryl, Campbell and Mei Ling (all portrayed by their original Japanese voice actors) pursue missions in hostile third world nations as FOXHOUND. The new characters introduced include Sgt. Allen Iishiba (voiced by Toshio Furukawa), a <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> operative who assists Snake and Meryl, Col. Mark Cortez (v.b. Osamu Saka), an old friend of Campbell who commands the fictional Esteria Army Special Forces, and Capt. Sergei Ivanovich (v.b.

5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who felt guilty over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble, rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917 Robertson was {{attached}} to the Desert Column as a staff officer. From there, he was sent to staff school in Egypt. However, on 7 March he suffered a broken leg in a riding accident and was hospitalised for two months. He returned to the staff school in May and finally graduated on 17 June. He was then posted to the newly formed Yeomanry Mounted Division as a General Staff Officer (Grade 3). In March 1918, he was posted to Headquarters <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> in Cairo. This was disbanded in April and Robertson became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG) at AIF Headquarters in Cairo. In January 1919, he became Assistant Adjutant General (AAG). He returned to Australia in July 1919. In addition to his Distinguished Service Order, he was twice mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Order of the Nile (4th Class) by the Sultan of Egypt.|$|E

In Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda, Army Times staff writer Sean Naylor describes Delta as having nearly 1,000 soldiers, of which approximately 250 to 300 are trained to conduct direct action and hostage rescue operations. The rest are highly specialized support personnel who are among the very best in their fields.|$|R

Furthermore, we introduce some Moufang-like conditions in affine buildings of rank 3, and characterize those examples arising from algebraic,classical or mixed type groups over a local field. In particular, we characterize the p-adic-like affine rank 3 buildings by a certain p-adic Moufang condition, and show that such a condition has zero probability to survive in hyperbolic rank 3 buildings. This shows that a construction of hyperbolic buildings as analogues of p-adic affine buildings is very unlikely to exist. Mathematics Subject Classifications (1991) : 51 E 24, 51 C 05.

25|$|The Battle of Haditha Dam {{occurred}} on the 24th March 2003, Rangers from 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, conducted a combat parachute drop onto H-1 Air Base, securing the site as a staging area for operations in the west. <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the Haditha Dam on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction {{of a large number}} of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion 70th Armor. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly - a desert strip established by <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, <b>Delta</b> <b>Force</b> was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.|$|E
40|$|The {{suppression}} of turbulent transport by large scale mean shear flows and uniform magnetic fields is investigated in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence {{driven by a}} small-scale forcing with finite correlation time. By numerical integration the turbulent magnetic diffusivity DT is shown to be significantly quenched, with a scaling DT∝B− 2 Ω 0 − 5 / 4, {{which is much more}} severe than {{in the case of a}} short or <b>delta</b> correlated <b>forcing</b> typified by white noise, studied in E. Kim and B. Dubrulle [Phys. Plasmas 8, 813 (2001) ]. Here B and Ω 0 are magnetic field strength and flow shear rate, respectively. The forcing with finite correlation time also leads to much stronger {{suppression of}} momentum transport through the cancellation of the Reynolds stress by the Maxwell stress with a positive small value of turbulent viscosity, νT> 0. While fluctuating kinetic and magnetic energies are unaffected by the magnetic field just as in the case of a <b>delta</b> correlated <b>forcing,</b> they are much more severely quenched by flow shear than in that of a <b>delta</b> correlated <b>forcing.</b> Underlying physical mechanisms for the reduction of turbulent transport and turbulence level by flow shear and magnetic field are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Abadan {{is thought}} to have been further {{developed}} into a major port city under the Abbasids' rule. In this time period, it was a commercial source of salt and woven mats. The siltation of the river <b>delta</b> <b>forced</b> the town further away from water; In the 14th century, however, Ibn Battutah described Abadan just as a small port in a flat salty plain. Politically, Abadan was often the subject of dispute between the nearby states; in 1847, Persia acquired it from Turkey, in which state Abadan has remained since. From the 17th century onward, the island of Abadan was part of the lands of the Arab Ka'ab (Bani Kaab) tribe. One section of this tribe, Mohaysen, had its headquarters at Mohammara(present-day Khorramshahr), until the removal of Shaikh Khaz'al Khan in 1924.|$|R
