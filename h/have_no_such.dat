5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E

25|$|EU {{member states}} {{differ in the}} degree of worker {{involvement}} in corporate management. In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the supervisory board. Other member states, such as the UK, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> requirement, and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management.|$|E

In the film, underground tunnels were depicted, but the house and the estate <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> feature. Later, the grounds served as the setting of Fleetwood Mac's Big Love video. Shots depicting the inside of the home were filmed on a sound stage.|$|E
25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} student awards available, varying in prestige, from local {{university}} awards to national awards.

This is largely because the other colleges <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> award, with the normal national prizes being named after experts in that field.|$|E

25|$|Justice Rehnquist, {{writing for}} the majority, held first {{that the fact that}} Camden adopted the discriminatory {{ordinance}} in its capacity as a municipality does not render it immune from review under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Secondly, he held that even though the ordinance discriminates against New Jerseyans who are not Camden residents just as much as it discriminates against out-of-state citizens, New Jersey citizens at least have the chance to remedy the problem through the political process (the state legislature). Out-of-state residents <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> option.|$|E
25|$|Many {{firearms}} manufacturers explicitly advise {{against the}} use of handloaded ammunition. Generally, this means that the maker's warranty is void and the manufacturer not liable for any damage to the gun or personal injury if handloaded ammunition is used which exceeded established limits for a particular arm. This arises because firearm manufacturers point out that while they have some influence and scope for redress with ammunition manufacturers, they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> influence over the actions of incompetent or overly ambitious individuals who assemble ammunition.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side of the debate, some argue that influencers <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> effect and {{therefore}} companies shouldn’t target their seeding efforts on a specific group of people. Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds examined the phenomenon through a computer network simulation under the assumption that influential people are more difficult to influence, therefore social hubs have a lower tendency to adopt new products. Their work suggests that highly connected individuals do not play a crucial role in influencing others and that a random individual is just as likely to start a trend as connected people.|$|E

25|$|On the efflux of specie, Petty {{thought it}} vain {{to try to}} control it, and dangerous, as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money. He noted in Quantulumcunque {{concerning}} money that countries plentiful in gold <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> laws restricting specie. On exports in general, he regarded prescriptions, such as recent Acts of Parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn, as 'burthensome'. Further restrictions 'would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said Trade' (p.59), albeit with a concession that he is no expert {{in the study of}} the wool trade.|$|E
25|$|Kilmacolm {{gradually}} became {{a place with}} numerous amenities, {{with the construction of}} the Victorian schoolhouses of the village, the opening of a Royal Bank of Scotland branch in 1872 and piped clean water in 1878. Indicative of the changes which the gentrification of the village brought, in the 1920s a local referendum was held in the village under the Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913, resulting in it becoming a dry parish where the sale of alcohol was illegal. The numerous public houses which had existed in the Kilmacolm declined and it was to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> establishment from this time until the 1990s. In 1921, the parish council purchased the former Buchanan Arms building at the cross, turning it into a Village Institute or community centre, which it has continued to be until the renovation of the Cargill Centre in 2009-10. In the religious sphere, the establishment of many of Kilmacolm's churches can be credited to religious disagreements, particularly the practice of patronage within the Church of Scotland - which allowed local landowners to choose a parish minister. This practice ended in 1874.|$|E

The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [...] "the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear. I would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> imputation." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tale of Peter Rabbit and {{its three}} sequels {{are the best}} known and most {{successful}} of Potter's books. The author had an affinity for rabbits; she lived with them as pets and observed them closely for years. Though she once wrote that rabbits were creatures of [...] "warm volatile temperaments" [...] and were [...] "shallow and extremely transparent", she invested her rabbits {{with a variety of}} characterizations consistent with the nature of the animal. All the rabbit tales were inspired in part by Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus stories, which Potter began illustrating as early as 1893 in an attempt to find career direction and probably because they featured a rabbit as principal player. Although she incorporated Harris's [...] "rabbit-tobacco" [...] and his [...] "lippity-clippity, clippity-lippity" [...] (as [...] "lippity-lippity") into her literary vocabulary, she was unable to bring his characters to the English country garden as Victorian gentlemen [...] they remained inexorably fixed in the Antebellum American South as slaves and slave owners. Harris's wily Br'er Rabbit is motivated by vengeance and wins by cunning, but Potter's rabbits <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> motivation and succeed due to their adventurous spirit and pure luck.|$|E
