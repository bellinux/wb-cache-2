40|$|Abstract—Monitoring {{the tool}} <b>flank</b> <b>wear</b> without {{affecting}} the throughput is considered as the prudent method in production technology. The examination {{has to be}} done without affecting the machining process. In this paper we proposed a novel work that is used to determine tool <b>flank</b> <b>wear</b> by observing the sound signals emitted during the turning process. The work-piece material we used here is steel and aluminum and the cutting insert was carbide material. Two different cutting speeds were used in this work. The feed rate and the cutting depth were constant whereas the <b>flank</b> <b>wear</b> was a variable. The emitted sound signal of a fresh tool (0 mm <b>flank</b> <b>wear)</b> a slightly worn tool (0. 2 - 0. 25 mm <b>flank</b> <b>wear)</b> and a severely worn tool (0. 4 mm and above <b>flank</b> <b>wear)</b> during turning process were recorded separately using a high sensitive microphone. Analysis using Singular Value Decomposition was done on these sound signals to extract the feature sound components. Observation of the results showed that an increase in tool <b>flank</b> <b>wear</b> correlates with an increase in the values of SVD features produced out of the sound signals for both the materials. Hence it can be concluded that wear monitoring of tool flank during turning process using SVD features with the Fuzzy C means classification on the emitted sound signal is a potential and relatively simple method...|$|E

The difficulty in machining stainless steels is manifested in high contact length and stresses, formation of serrated chips and development of chatter resulting in high tool wear rates and poor machined surface finish. The paper focuses {{on the performance of}} TiN coated-carbide inserts in machining stainless steel specimens in end milling operation performed on vertical machining centre (VMC). The performance of the tool is evaluated {{from the point of view}} of its wear intensity, mechanism of failure and generation and effect of chatter on tool wear and vice versa. The investigations were aimed at determining the effect of cutting parameters, specifically cutting speed, feed and depth of cut, on chatter amplitude, tool wear rate, mechanism of tool wear and using these data and machined surface roughness values from previous work to come up with recommended values of cutting parameters for semi-finish and finish end milling operation of stainless steel work materials. For recording vibration signals a dual channel portable signal analyzers was used and the signals were analyzed using Pulse Multi-analyzer version 4. 2 software. Tool wear was measured using an optical microscope with digital readout capabilities along 3 axes. The tool wear mechanisms were studied under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results of the investigation show that acceleration amplitudes generally increase with cutting speed and the magnitude of tool <b>flank</b> <b>wears.</b> It has been also found that an increase in feed and depth of cut leads to higher acceleration amplitudes. The most common wear mechanisms observed during machining of stainless steel are attrition, micro and macro chipping of the tool at lower cutting speeds, and diffusion and mechanical failures due to intensive chatter at higher speeds. It has been also established that stable cutting speeds with relatively low tool wear intensity and satisfactory machined surface finish can be achieved through proper selection of cutting parameters.

Titanium’s low thermal conductivity, segmentation of the chips and extreme reactivity at high temperatures cause a focused heat load on the cutting edge. These properties give titanium its characteristic of being difficult to machine, particularly when high performance machining parameters dictate elevated cutting speeds. This leaves the need to investigate cooling strategies to maintain or improve tool life. The reduction of chip/tool contact area and time leads to a decreased heat transfer and tool wear. In this work the application of external compressed air jet cooling (dry cutting), flood cooling and focused high pressure internal cooling strategies are studied.
