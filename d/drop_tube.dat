40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>tubes</b> and <b>drop</b> towers {{providing}} the capability for performing low-gravity materials experiments in an earth-based laboratory are described. Although processing times are short, the experiments can be reproduced easily and economically.

40|$|The fluid dynamic investigaton {{of simple}} free liquid drops is {{described}} based on ground-based and low-gravity experimental results. The behavior of compound drops and liquid shells {{as described in}} recent theoretical and experimental studies is discussed. Experimental investigations using both levitation devices and <b>drop</b> <b>tubes</b> are considered {{in the case of}} 1 -g laboratory investigations, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of both techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunity}} to conduct microgravity and related research still exists, {{even with the}} temporary delay in the U. S. Space Shuttle program. Several ground-based facilities are available and use of these facilities is highly recommended for the preparation of near and far term shuttle or space station experiments. <b>Drop</b> <b>tubes,</b> <b>drop</b> towers, aircraft, sounding rockets and {{a wide variety of}} other ground-based equipment can be used to simulate microgravity. This paper concentrates on the materials processing capabilities available at NASA Lewis Research Center (NASA Lewis), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Also included is information on gaining access to these facilities...|$|R
50|$|At {{the topmost}} storey {{of the tower}} lead was heated until molten and then poured into a <b>drop</b> <b>tube.</b> During the free fall the lead drops became {{seamless}} spheres.|$|E
5000|$|The {{duration}} of free-fall produced in a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> {{depends on the}} length of the tube and its degree of internal evacuation. The 105-meter <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> at Marshall Space Flight Center produces 4.6 seconds of weightlessness when it is fully evacuated. In the drop facility Fallturm Bremen at University of Bremen a catapult can be used to throw the experiment upwards to prolong the weightlessness from 4.74 to nearly 9.3 seconds. [...] Negating the physical space needed for the initial acceleration, this technique doubles the effective period of weightlessness. The NASA Glenn Research Center has a 5 second drop tower (The Zero Gravity Facility) and a 2.2 second drop tower (The 2.2 Second Drop Tower).|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{operating}} cost of a drop tower {{is due to the}} need for evacuation of the <b>drop</b> <b>tube,</b> to eliminate the effect of aerodynamic drag. Alternatively the experiment is placed inside an outer box (the drag shield) for which, due to its weight, during its fall the reduction of acceleration due to air drag is less.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} NASA-supported {{microgravity}} material-processing research on Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz is reviewed; the currently available ground and Space Shuttle laboratory facilities are characterized and illustrated with drawings; and {{an overview of}} the Microgravity Science and Applications Program (MSAP) is given. The ground systems include <b>drop</b> <b>tubes,</b> <b>drop</b> towers, aircraft, and levitators; on the Space Shuttle, facilities are provided in the Orbiter middeck, in the payload bay, and in the Spacelab module. The aims of MSAP and the mechanisms for academic or industry participation are outlined, and typical results of MSAP-organized research in electronic materials, biotechnology, metals and alloys, glasses and ceramics, combustion, fluid dynamics, and transport phenomena are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{mechanics}} of gases and liquids and solidification processes were investigated under microgravity conditions during Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz missions. Electromagnetic, acoustic, and aerodynamic levitation devices, <b>drop</b> <b>tubes,</b> aircraft parabolic flight trajectories, and vertical sounding rockets were developed for low-g simulation. The Spacelab 3 mission {{will be carried}} out in a gravity gradient flight attitude; analyses of sources of vehicle dynamic accelerations with associated g-levels and angular rates will produce results for future specific experiments...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} become possible to perform containerless, high-temperature liquid-phase processing of many nonvolatile materials without resort to orbital microgravity, thereby facilitating {{the conduct of}} materials research in conjunction with noncontact diagnostic instruments. The melt-levitation techniques are electromagnetic, aerodynamic, acoustic, aeroacoustic, and electrostatic; nonorbital microgravity conditions are obtainable aboard NASA's KC- 135 aircraft on parabolic flight paths, {{as well as in}} <b>drop</b> <b>tubes</b> and towers. Applications encompass the purification of metals and the creation of nonequilibrium and metastable structures. Process control and property measurements include optical pyrometry and emissivity, laser polarimetry, and drop calorimetry...|$|R
50|$|A {{temporary}} micro-g environment {{exists in}} a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> (in a tower or shaft), a sub-orbital spaceflight, e.g. with a sounding rocket, and in an airplane such as used by NASA's Reduced Gravity Research Program, aka the Vomit Comet, and by the Zero Gravity Corporation. A temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts, for some experiments, for filming movies, and for recreational purposes.|$|E
50|$|In {{physics and}} {{materials}} science, a drop tower or <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> is a structure {{used to produce}} a controlled period of weightlessness for an object under study. Air bags, polystyrene pellets, and magnetic or mechanical brakes are sometimes used to arrest {{the fall of the}} experimental payload. In other cases, high-speed impact with a substrate {{at the bottom of the}} tower is an intentional part of the experimental protocol.|$|E
50|$|For {{a typical}} {{materials}} science experiment, {{a sample of}} the material under study is loaded into the top of the <b>drop</b> <b>tube,</b> which is filled with inert gas or evacuated to create a low-pressure environment. Following any desired preprocessing (e.g. induction heating to melt a metal alloy), the sample is released to fall {{to the bottom of the}} tube. During its flight or upon impact the sample can be characterized with instruments such as cameras and pyrometers.|$|E
40|$|Material {{processing}} techniques {{which can}} most fully utilize the advantages provided by space {{are related to}} containerless processing. An avoidance of physical contact between the melt and {{the walls of a}} container leads to an elimination of container-induced contamination and heterogeneous nucleation. Containerless processing facilities development by NASA will provide a basis for the performance of precursor experiments and processing technologies studies prior to Space Shuttle flights. Attention is given to acoustic containerless processing, electromagnetic containerless processing, electrostatic levitation technology, <b>drop</b> <b>tubes,</b> and the use of zero-G KC- 135 aircraft flights for tests and training purposes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>tubes</b> and {{electromagnetic}} levitation {{are described as}} techniques for containerless processing. The constraints of maximum undercoolability of metals are discussed with respect to thermodynamic considerations and the onset of homogeneous nucleation. Dendrite growth occurring in undercooled melts is described {{on the basis of}} experimental investigations and modern dendrite growth theories. The importance of the knowledge of thermophysical properties in the understanding of both nucleation and crystal growth in undercooled melts is pointed out. Experimental techniques are presented which allow the measurement of the dependence of such properties on temperature in particular by using electromagnetic positioning in future space missions...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in order to evaluate the applicability of an alternative system for managing and distributing beef cattle manure during irrigation on maize when the crop is present {{in order to reduce the}} negative effects on air and water quality. For this purpose a traveller boom equipped with <b>drop</b> <b>tubes</b> was used for the distribution of wastes (liquid separated) mixed with irrigation water (fertigation) on the soil surface. First analysis on leaching water samples seem to indicate that the percolation water quality is better due to a reduction in nitrate nitrogen losses. Besides, the alternative technique reduces the emissions of ammonia in the air and consequently the diffusion of bad odours in the atmosphere...|$|R
50|$|Fallturm Bremen is a drop {{tower at}} the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity at the University of Bremen in Bremen. It was built between 1988 and 1990, and {{includes}} a 122-metre-high <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> (actual drop distance is 110 m), in which for 4.74 seconds (with release of the drop capsule), or for over 9 seconds (with {{the use of a}} catapult, installed in 2004) weightlessness can be produced. The entire tower, formed out of a reinforced concrete shank, is 146 metres high.|$|E
40|$|The {{final results}} of the <b>Drop</b> <b>Tube</b> Solidification of NiAl 3 are presented. Problems {{associated}} with the utilization of a dripper furnace in the <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> are discussed and the modification of experimental procedures required to achieve results are described. Sample microstructures of <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> samples are compared with other samples. The dendrite arm spacings of <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> samples are correlated with the rapid cooling rates...|$|E
40|$|A {{susceptibility}} apparatus {{to measure}} superconducting properties of samples {{made in the}} MSFC <b>Drop</b> <b>Tube</b> {{was used to measure}} the transition temperature (Tc) and susceptibilities of Nb and Nb Ge Alloys prepared in bulk spherical (2 - 4 mm diameter) form using a 32 m <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> in which containerless low gravity solidification could take place. Results indicate that a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> processing environment was beneficial for increasing the Tc of the superconducting phase of the material over that of arc melted material. The increase in Tc is found {{to be related to the}} amount of solidification of the total sample that took place before reaching the bottom of the <b>drop</b> <b>tube.</b> In phase and quadrature phase measurements of the specimen's susceptibility indicated that some improvement in homogeneity takes place in <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> processing. These phase measurements also indicated little or no shielding of a lower Tc phase by a higher Tc filamentary structure...|$|E

40|$|The 30 -m and 100 m-long <b>drop</b> <b>tubes</b> at the Marshall Space Flight Center {{have been}} used to obtain large {{undercooling}} in Nb-Ge alloys. Electron beam melting has been used to obtain drops approximately 2. 5 mm in diam. In the 30 -m tube, many specimens fell the length of the tube without solidifying, and were ultimately liquid-quenched in oil. The amount of undercooling prior to the quench was usually around 0. 13 T(m). In the 100 -m tube, freezing generally initiated during free fall, and the maximum undercooling was around 0. 22 T(m). Microstructures were characterized by a combination of X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis by X-rays. A variety of interesting microstructures was observed...|$|R
