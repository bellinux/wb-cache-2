25|$|The cricket season started early, on 8 April, with MCC {{playing the}} Champion County, {{or at least}} it would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the rain had not delayed the start till the next day. The other games played were all between the {{first-class}} counties and university sides. The first matches showed a bumper crop of centuries, with little joy for bowlers, but there were no surprises. The MCC ended up beating Warwickshire.|$|E

His reaction to London's successful bid was: [...] "I don't know what else we could <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>If</b> we don't have it now, I guess we will never get it. The IOC {{seems to be very}} pro-Anglo-Saxon. I feel extremely gutted." ...|$|E
500|$|When writing [...] "Vincent and the Doctor", Curtis put up {{prints of}} Van Gogh {{paintings}} {{around the house}} {{as well as a}} board with index cards outlining the plot. His children helped him come up with some ideas. Gillan commented that the story had a different style and approach and was more character-driven. Though it was a subject he knew [...] "quite a lot" [...] about, he still read a 200-page biography of Van Gogh, which was more research than he normally would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> working on other projects; he took Van Gogh very seriously. As such, he wanted to be [...] "truthful rather than cruel" [...] and refused to write any jokes about Van Gogh's ears after he famously cut one of them off. However, he did incorporate other humour as he naturally wanted to [...] "try to make things funny".|$|E
5000|$|From the PAP {{definition}} [...] "a {{person is}} morally {{responsible for what}} he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> only <b>if</b> he could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise", Frankfurt infers {{that a person is}} not morally responsible for what he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> he could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise - a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it possible for us to do otherwise.|$|R

500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt as I would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt as I would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

On casting the actors, he said, [...] "I know what actors I want for it. I'll {{be able to go to}} them easily" [...] and that [...] " [...] makes those characters beautiful and sexual.

2500|$|When {{on trial}} in Charleston, the pirate Job Bayley was asked why he had {{attacked}} several warships that were sent to capture him, he answered that [...] "We thought {{it had been a}} pirate." [...] At yet another trial in London the pirate John Bayley comically played dumb when the Judge asked what he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> the warship that apprehended him {{was nothing more than a}} merchant ship answering, [...] "I don't know what I would have done." [...] Both men knew that their fate was sealed the moment they were apprehended and both in turn hanged at the gallows.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{participants}} of the Gaza flotilla, Sinan Albayrak, told the Turkish newspaper Akşam {{in response to}} the Israeli apology, [...] "hat is the importance of the apology? 'We killed nine people and are sorry' – of course it sounds ridiculous. I say this is what the state should <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>If</b> [...] only had prevented this at the start. But we asked for it. We went there ourselves." [...] According to Hürriyet Daily News Semih Idiz, some Turkish citizens are even suggesting that those involved with the Mavi Marmara incident should also bring charges against the Turkish state for playing a prominent role in supporting the Mavi Marmara's mission and for failing to prevent the death of nine Turks on the ship.|$|E

It was just brilliant and totally deserved." [...] Tom Queally said: [...] "You never see an F1 car win on anything but tarmac but for him to win on ground like that shows how special he is.

2500|$|During Brown's tenure, the {{magazine}} was honored with 4 George Polk Awards, 5 Overseas Press Club Awards, and 10 National Magazine Awards, including a 1995 award for General Excellence, the first in {{the magazine}}'s history. Newsstand sales rose 145 percent The New Yorkers circulation increased to 807,935 for the second half of 1997, up from 658,916 during the corresponding period in 1992. Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up (which routinely lose money): [...] "It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. She did what we would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> we invented the New Yorker from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be." [...] Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: in 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{followed}} Life Studies with Imitations (1961), {{a volume}} of loose translations of poems by classical and modern European poets, including Rilke, Montale, Baudelaire, Pasternak, and Rimbaud, for which he received the 1962 Bollingen Poetry Translation Prize. However, critical response to Imitations was mixed and sometimes hostile (as {{was the case with}} Vladimir Nabokov's public response to Lowell's Mandelstam translations). In a review of Lowell's Collected Poems, the poet Michael Hofmann wrote that although he thought Life Studies was Lowell's best book, Imitations was Lowell's most [...] "pivotal book," [...] arguing that the book [...] "marks the entry into his work of what one might term ‘international style’, something coolly open to not-quite-English." [...] In the book's introduction, Lowell explained that his idiosyncratic translations should be thought of as [...] "imitations" [...] rather than strict translations since he took many liberties with the originals, trying to [...] "do what [...] authors might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> they were writing their poems now and in America." ...|$|E
5000|$|Having {{presented}} his counter {{argument against the}} principle of alternate possibilities, Frankfurt suggests that it be revised {{to take into account}} the fallacy of the notion that coercion precludes an agent from moral responsibility. It must be only because of coercion that the agent acts as he does. The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: [...] "A person is not morally responsible for what he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>if</b> he <b>did</b> it only because he could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise." ...|$|R
