30|$|Determination of units: For {{every word}} in the test sentence, we first searched for units <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> which are quinphones or units <b>of</b> <b>length</b> equal to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the word if the word is {{comprised}} of fewer than five phones. If units <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> were not found, then we searched for units <b>of</b> <b>length</b> which is one less than the maximum length, and so on. In short, we <b>joined</b> units <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> when they were available in the database or used backoff units <b>of</b> shorter <b>lengths.</b> This approach resulted in fewer joins and a more natural and faster synthesis.|$|R

50|$|Pipe clamps serve {{a similar}} purpose to bar clamps but are {{generally}} {{less expensive to}} purchase and have a versatility derived from {{the ability to use}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> pipe to suit ones needs. The same clamp heads might be switched over from a two-foot <b>length</b> <b>of</b> pipe to a twelve-foot length as the project at hand dictates.

5000|$|For a {{quadrature}} of {{a rectangle}} with the sides a and b {{it is necessary}} to construct a square with the side [...] (the geometric mean of a and b). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from <b>joining</b> line segments <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> a and b, then the height (BH in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection {{to the point where it}} crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of a and b. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical rebar connections, {{also known}} as {{mechanical}} splices, are used to <b>join</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> rebar together. Building code requirements for masonry construction now require longer lap lengths for some bar sizes. These changes mean more congestion in masonry cells and more difficult construction. To alleviate this problem, builders can either use open-cell blocks, which are more expensive, or use mechanical rebar couplers to eliminate the lap. Reinforcing bar coupling has all of the features desirable in a rebar joining system combined with unequalled simplicity of installation. Couplers are designed to splice the same diameter bars where one bar is free to move and can be rotated.|$|R
30|$|Let G=(V,E) be {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G). Its order is |V(G)|, denoted by n(G) (or n for short), and its size is |E(G)|, denoted by m(G) (or m for short). For a vertex v ∈ V(G), let N(v) be the set of all neighbors of v in G and let d(v)=|N(v)| be the degree of v. Particularly, denote by Δ(G) the maximum degree of G. A pendent vertex is a vertex with degree one. The diameter of a connected graph G, denoted by d(G), is the maximum distance among all pairs of vertices in G. Let S_n and P_n be the star and the path of order n, respectively. Let S^k_a,b be the tree of order n obtained from two stars S_a+ 1, S_b+ 1 by <b>joining</b> a path <b>of</b> <b>length</b> k between their central vertices (see Figure  2).

40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEU) {{has been}} used to measure muscle microvascular perfusion in vivo in response to exercise and insulin. In the present study we address whether CEU measurement of capillary volume is influenced by bulk flow and if measured capillary filling rate allows discrimination of different flow pattern changes within muscle. Three in vitro models were used: (i) bulk flow rate was varied within a single <b>length</b> <b>of</b> capillary tubing; (ii) at constant bulk flow, capillary volume was increased 3 -fold by <b>joining</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> capillary in series, and compared to a single length; and (iii) at constant bulk flow, capillary volume was increased by sharing flow between a number <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> identical capillaries in parallel. The contrast medium for CEU was gas-filled albumin microbubbles. Pulsing interval (time) versus acoustic–intensity curves were constructed and from these, capillary volume and capillary filling rate were calculated. CEU estimates of capillary volume were not affected by changes in bulk flow. Furthermore, as CEU estimates of capillary volume increased, measures of capillary filling rate decreased, regardless of whether capillaries were connected in series or parallel. Therefore, CEU can detect a change in filling rate of the microvascular volume under measurement, but it {{can not be used to}} discriminate between different flow patterns within muscle that might account for capillary recruitment in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) space {{experiment}} {{will demonstrate}} {{the use of}} an electrodynamic tether propulsion system to generate thrust in space by decreasing the orbital altitude of a Delta 11 Expendable Launch Vehicle second stage. ProSEDS will use the flight-proven Small Expendable Deployer System to deploy a newly designed and developed tether which will provide tether generated drag thrust of approx. 0. 4 N. The development and production of very long tethers with specific properties for performance and survivability will be required to enable future tether missions. The ProSEDS tether design and the development process may provide some lessons learned for these future missions. The ProSEDS system requirements drove the design of the tether to have three different sections of tether each serving a specialized purpose. The tether is a total of 15 kilometers long: 10 kilometers of a non-conductive Dyneema lead tether; 5 km of CCOR conductive coated wire; and 220 meters of insulated wire with a protective Kevlar overbraid. Production and <b>joining</b> <b>of</b> long tether <b>lengths</b> involved many development efforts.

40|$|Soldering {{processes}} {{are used to}} bond elongated interconnectors to metallized silicon wafers e. g. solar cells. The minimal process time {{is expected to be}} limited due to the thermoshock induction in the substrate, the required time for the energy deposition and the wetting process of the solder. The simultaneous energy deposition realized with a diode laser and a line generating optic lowers the process time for interconnectors with a <b>joining</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 140 mm below 1 s. Furthermore, the selective energy deposition on the interconnector is expected to reduce the temperature-induced stress in the substrate. We evaluate the soldering process with a high-speed camera and compare them with the characteristic temperature profile measured with a pyrometer. Different process times and the effect of short-term overheating to reach process times below 0. 5 s are investigated. The minimum process time is assessed regarding the control of the process stages and the effect on the solder quality...|$|R
