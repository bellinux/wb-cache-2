5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E
5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E

25|$|The WPA, NYA, and CCC relief {{programs}} allocated 10% {{of their}} budgets to blacks (who comprised about 10% {{of the total}} population, and 20% of the poor). They operated separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as white units. Some leading white New Dealers, especially Eleanor Roosevelt, <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> and Aubrey Williams worked to ensure blacks received at least 10% of welfare assistance payments. However, these benefits were small {{in comparison to the}} economic and political advantages that whites received. Most unions excluded blacks from joining. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the South was virtually impossible, especially since most blacks worked in hospitality and agricultural sectors.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 he {{proposed}} a Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act, which would fund the transformation of coal and its products into other useful forms of energy. To promote the viability of synthetic fuels in November 1943, Randolph and a professional pilot flew in an aircraft powered by gasoline derived from coal. The small, single-engine airplane flew from Morgantown, West Virginia to National Airport in Washington, DC. Aided by Interior Secretary <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes</b> and Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney, the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act was approved on 5 April 1944. The Act authorized $30 million for the construction and operation of demonstration plants to produce synthetic liquid fuels.|$|E

25|$|Creation of {{the park}} had {{immediate}} benefits to some Virginians. During the Great Depression, many young men received training and jobs through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The first CCC camp in Virginia {{was established in the}} George Washington National Forest near Luray, and Governor Pollard quickly filled his initial quota of 5,000 workers. About 1,000 men and boys worked on Skyline Drive, and about 100,000 worked in Virginia during the agency's existence. In Shenandoah Park, CCC crews removed many of the dead chestnut trees whose skeletons marred views in the new park, as well as constructed trails and facilities. Tourism revenues also skyrocketed. On the other hand, CCC crews were also assigned to burn and destroy some cabins in the park, to prevent residents from coming back. Also, U.S. Secretary of the Interior <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes</b> who had jurisdiction over the NPS and partial jurisdiction over the CCC, tried to use his authority to force Byrd to cooperate on other New Deal projects.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{presided over}} the {{establishment}} of several agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others in need. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), {{under the leadership of}} Harry Hopkins, was designed to distribute relief to state governments. The Public Works Administration (PWA), under the leadership of Secretary of the Interior <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> was created to oversee the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools. The most popular of all New Deal agencies– and Roosevelt's favorite– was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work on rural local projects. Roosevelt also expanded a Hoover agency, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to take land out of crops and to cut herds.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{remained}} a vigorous fundraiser {{for the community}} for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a [...] "communist plot", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes</b> also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority {{for the federal government}} until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss.|$|E

500|$|Voorhis was {{generally}} highly regarded by his colleagues {{and others in}} Washington. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois considered Voorhis [...] "a political saint", and said of Voorhis that [...] "riven by conscience, he had a compulsion to master every subject that came before the House, and having mastered it, he spoke his mind." [...] Voorhis would make five-minute speeches in the House of Representatives at any opportunity, on matters ranging from local concerns in his district to international monetary issues. The press nicknamed him [...] "Kid Atlas", seeming to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders. The press corps also voted him the most honest congressman, and the fifth most intelligent. However, Interior Secretary <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes</b> described Voorhis's 1943 resignation from HUAC as the representative being [...] "obbly as usual".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} {{constructing}} such a pipeline was first proposed in 1940 by the Secretary of the Interior, <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> {{who argued that}} [...] "the building of a crude oil pipeline from Texas to the East might not be economically sound; but that {{in the event of}} an emergency it might be absolutely necessary". A consortium led by Standard Oil put forward a bid to build one in spring 1941, but the plan failed, due to concerns over the amount of steel that would be required for such a project. In May 1941, Ickes was appointed as the Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, and in December 1942 became the administrator of the Petroleum Administration for War. New laws were passed to enable the building of pipelines necessary for the war effort, including the compulsory purchasing of land under the right of eminent domain.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes</b> hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E

500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. <b>Harold</b> <b>Ickes,</b> too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E

The ensuing struggle over ideological identity increased the ineffectiveness of the Justice Department.
