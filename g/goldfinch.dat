5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> is not {{threatened}} by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American <b>goldfinch.</b> Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American <b>goldfinch</b> {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American <b>goldfinch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{introduce}} the American <b>goldfinch</b> into Bermuda in the 19th century, and Tahiti in 1938, but the species failed to become established.|$|E
5|$|Cagebird breeders {{sometimes}} breed bird hybrids {{known as}} mules between species of finch, such as <b>goldfinch</b> × canary.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>goldfinch's</b> {{preferred}} food {{is small}} seeds {{such as those}} from thistles (the Latin name is from Carduus, a genus of thistles) and teasels, but insects are also taken when feeding young. It also regularly visits bird feeders in winter. In the winter <b>goldfinches</b> group together to form flocks of up to forty, occasionally more. <b>Goldfinches</b> are attracted to back gardens in Europe and North America by birdfeeders containing [...] (commercially described as nyjer) seed. This seed of an annual from South Asia is small, and high in oils. Special polycarbonate feeders with small oval slits at which the <b>goldfinches</b> feed are sometimes used.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Chaffinch {{declared}} {{she would}} be delighted to become a mother to the little <b>goldfinches,</b> and rear them properly. She had always had good success in bringing up her own children, she claimed, and the <b>goldfinches</b> were first cousins to the chaffinches, so she was sure to understand their ways perfectly.|$|R
5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only {{reaction}} is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which {{pose a threat}} to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American <b>goldfinch</b> was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American <b>goldfinch</b> {{uses its}} feet {{extensively}} in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American <b>goldfinch</b> feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American <b>goldfinch</b> has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American <b>goldfinch</b> chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goldfinches</b> are {{commonly}} kept and bred in captivity {{around the world}} because of their distinctive appearance and pleasant song. In Britain during the 19th century many thousands of <b>goldfinches</b> were trapped each year to be sold as cage-birds. One of the earliest campaigns of the Society for the Protection of Birds was directed against this trade..|$|R

5|$|Human {{activity}} has generally benefited the American <b>goldfinch.</b> It is {{often found in}} residential areas, attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas. Deforestation also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{immature}} American <b>goldfinch</b> has a dull brown back, and {{the underside}} is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> (Spinus tristis) {{is a small}} North American bird in the finch family. It is migratory, {{ranging from}} mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the {{breeding}} season, and from {{just south of the}} Canada–United States border to Mexico during the winter.|$|E

5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> {{begins its}} {{breeding}} season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> prefers {{open country}} where weeds thrive, such as fields, meadows, flood plains, {{as well as}} roadsides, orchards, and gardens. It may {{also be found in}} open {{deciduous}} and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth. This habitat preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, {{there has been no}} {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European <b>goldfinch,</b> house sparrow, starlings and blackbirds are common. Introduced bees and European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E

5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the American <b>goldfinch</b> {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
5|$|S. t. salicamans occurs {{west of the}} Sierra Nevada range {{during the}} summer and in south and central Baja California Peninsula to the Mojave Desert and Colorado Desert in winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than other {{subspecies}}, and in summer, the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies. This subspecies has been called the willow <b>goldfinch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> {{is found}} in {{residential}} areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E

5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American <b>goldfinch</b> displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American <b>goldfinch</b> is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>goldfinch</b> is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will {{occasionally}} eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
