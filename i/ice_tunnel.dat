25|$|In the film, Lois {{arrives in}} the Arctic to {{research}} a story about an alien occurrence in the Arctic. She follows a mysterious man into an <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> (a disguised Clark Kent tracking a buried Kryptonian scout ship). When she is attacked by a security droid protecting the ship, Lois is made aware of Clark's abilities when he saves her life. As a result of those events, Lois begins writing an expose piece for the Daily Planet on her mysterious savior. She tracks down Clark's identity to Smallville and interviews his mother. After learning the circumstances surrounding his adopted father's death and Clark's desire to remain hidden from society, Lois ceases writing the piece. When General Zod arrived on Earth, he demanded the citizens of Earth relinquish Kal-El to Zod's custody. Shortly thereafter, Lois is apprehended by the government once her association with Kal-El is known. Superman confronted the government officials to secure Lois' release at a military installation while turning himself over to them. Superman, {{in cooperation with the}} military, agrees to surrender to Zod's emissary, who also takes Lois aboard their spaceship. On the ship, Lois escapes with the help of Jor-El, she restores Earth's atmosphere on the ship, restoring Superman's powers and enables him to escape Zod's trap and eventually defeating the Kryptonian forces when they attack Earth. When Zod forces Superman to kill him, Lois consoles Superman, who is distraught after ending Zod's life. At the conclusion, Clark is introduced by Perry White to Lois as the new stringer for the Daily Planet, which will become Clark's new secret identity. Lois, surprised but willing to keep his secret, plays along and welcomes him.|$|E
6000|$|This, however, {{would not}} have been necessary, for Tom Burton turned upon him. [...] "Idiot," [...] said he, [...] "if that is your way of {{thinking}} you might as well say that if a well caves in you should never again dig for water, or that nobody should have a cellar under his house for fear that the house should fall into it. There's no more danger of the ice beneath us ever giving way again than there is that this bluff should crumble under our feet. That break in the roof of the <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> was caused by my digging away the face of the bluff very near that spot. The high temperature of the outer air weakened the ice, and it fell. But down here, under this ground and secure from the influences of the heat of the outer air, the mass of ice is more solid than rock. We will build a brick arch over the place where the accident happened, and then {{there will not be a}} safer mine on this continent than this ice-mine will be." ...|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not reply}} {{that it was not}} on the earth but under it, that I became aware of the fact, but hurried toward the Havelot house, hoping to {{overtake}} Agnes if she had gone that way. But I did not see her, and suddenly a startling idea struck me, and I turned and ran home as fast as I could go. When I reached my grounds I went directly to the mouth of the shaft. There was nobody there, for the crowd was collected into a solid mass {{on the top of the}} bluff, listening to a lecture from Tom Burton, who deemed it well to promote the growth of interest and healthy opinion in regard to his wonderful discovery and my valuable possession. I hurried down the shaft, and near the end of it, just before it joined the <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel,</b> I beheld Agnes sitting upon the wooden track. She was not unconscious, for as I approached she slightly turned her head. I sprang toward her; I kneeled beside her; I took her in my arms. [...] "Oh, Agnes, dearest Agnes," [...] I cried, [...] "what is the matter? What has happened to you? Has a piece of ice fallen upon you? Have you slipped and hurt yourself?" ...|$|E

40|$|Icing {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to document ice shapes formed on three different two-dimensional airfoils and to {{study the effects of}} the accreted ice on aerodynamic performance. The models tested were representative of airfoil designs in current use for each of the commercial transport, business jet, and general aviation categories of aircraft. The models were subjected to a range of icing conditions in an <b>icing</b> wind <b>tunnel.</b> The conditions were selected primarily from the Federal Aviation Administration's Federal Aviation Regulations 25 Appendix C atmospheric icing conditions. A few large droplet icing conditions were included. To verify the aerodynamic performance measurements, molds were made of selected ice shapes formed in the <b>icing</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Castings of the ice were made from the molds and placed on a model in a dry, low-turbulence wind tunnel where precision aerodynamic performance measurements were made.

Zenobia uses an <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> to reach the land of the Arimaspi, and she, Rafi, and the Minoton climb subterranean stairs to emerge in the warm, Mediterranean-like valley above.|$|E
50|$|Although {{initially}} successful, the ice camps {{were subject}} to gradual deformation, compression, and subsidence requiring annual repair and realignment operations. Also, by 1966 the Army had different priorities, and Tuto was closed as a permanent camp. By the mid 1970s, activities were reduced to yearly visits for updates on ice deformation. Camp Tuto became a ghost town, although the airstrip, the ice ramp, and for some years also the <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> remained usable. The ice ramp is still used for scientific access to the ice cap, including supply trains to mid-ice sites.|$|E

The ship's captain and his henchmen take the light from the lighthouse and transport it to the island where Jenna and Beetle reside, and they see them coming. Miarr then leads Lucy and Wolf Boy to an underwater machine which allows them to approach the island unseen.|$|E
5000|$|The area now {{occupied}} by the Twin Cities generally consisted of a 155 foot (47 m) thick layer of St. Peter Sandstone, under a 16 foot (5 m) thick layer of shale, under a 35 foot (11 m) thick layer of Platteville limestone. [...] These layers {{were the result of}} an Ordovician Period sea which covered east-central Minnesota 500 million years ago. [...] The hard limestone cap was formed from fossilized shell fish. About 20,000 years ago, the area was covered by the Superior Lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet, which left the St. Croix moraine on the Twin Cities as it receded. [...] Later the Grantsburg Sublobe of the Des Moines Lobe also covered the area. Under these vast layers of <b>ice,</b> <b>tunnel</b> valleys were formed, cutting through the limestone layer with tremendous force, to release ice meltwater and glacier effluence. The result was a series of troughs in the limestone, which were filled by glacial till and outwash deposit as the glaciers receded. Sometimes the sediment would be mixed with huge chunks of ice, which would leave voids in the soil, or kettles. These kettles created basins for the Twin Cities Lakes, such as Harriet and Calhoun. [...] Connecting the city lakes in several north-south arteries are gorges cut through the bedrock, but filled with sand and sediment.|$|E

40|$|Isolated, Late Miocene volcanogenic {{sequences}} {{in northern}} Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula, form an unusual, cogenetic association of volcaniclastic, sandy-gravelly lithofacies (including tillites) and volcanic (lava/hyalocalstite) lithofacies. Using simple lithofacies analysis and theoretical considerations of hydrodynamic effects of subglacial eruptions, valley-confined volcanic activity beneth thin, wet-based ice is suggested. The Alexander Island successions are complete {{enough to be}} regarded as model sequences for this uncommonly recorded type of eruptive/depositional activity. The sedimentary lithofacies represent resedimented tuffs and meltout or flow tills, which were probably deposited in subglacial ice tunnels eroded or enlarged by volcanically heated meltwater. The volcanic lithofacies formed by the interaction of hot magma with the <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> walls (generating abundant meltwater) and water-saturatedsediments, resulting in the formation of heterogeneous masses of lava and hyaloclastite. There is no obvious sequence organisation in the sedimentary sections.

40|$|A {{study was}} made at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Laboratory of the {{operation}} of an electrically heated glass panel, which simulated a segment of an airplane windshield, to determine if ice formations, which usually result {{in the loss of}} visibility, could be prevented. Tests were made in the 7 - by 3 -foot <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and in flight, under artificially created ice-forming conditions. Ice was prevented from forming on the windshield model in the tunnel by 1. 25 watts of power per square inch with the air temperature at 23 F and a velocity of 80 miles per hour. Using an improved model in flight, ice was prevented by 1. 43 watts of power per square inch of protected area and 2 watts per inch concentrated in the rim, with the air temperature at 26 F and a velocity of 120 miles per hour. The removal of a preformed ice cap was effected to a limited extent in the tunnel by the use of 1. 89 watts of power per square inch when the temperature and velocity were 25 F and 80 miles per hour, respectively. The results indicate that service tests with an improved design are justified...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the N. A. C. A. <b>ice</b> <b>tunnel</b> at air temperatures from 20 degrees to 28 degrees Fahrenheit and at a velocity of 80 miles per hour to determine whether ice formations on a model wing could be prevented by the use of the heat from the engine-exhaust gas. Various spanwise duct systems were tested in a 6 -foot-chord N. A. C. A. 23012 wing model. The formation of ice over the entire wing chord was prevented by the direct heating of the forward 10 percent of the wing by hot air, which was passed through leading-edge ducts. Under dry conditions, enough heat to maintain the temperature of the forward 10 percent of the wing at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit above that of the ambient air was required for the prevention of ice formation. The air temperature in the ducts that was necessary to produce these skin temperatures varied from 360 degrees to 834 degrees Fahrenheit; the corresponding air velocities in the duct were 152 and 45 feet per second. Ice formations at the leading edge were locally prevented by air that passed over the interior of the wing surface at a velocity of 30 feet per second and a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit...|$|E

40|$|A {{test was}} {{conducted}} at NASA <b>Icing</b> Research <b>Tunnel</b> to evaluate altitude scaling methods for thermal ice protection system. Two new scaling methods based on Weber number were compared against a method based on Reynolds number. The results generally agreed with the previous set of tests conducted in NRCC Altitude <b>Icing</b> Wind <b>Tunnel</b> where the three methods of scaling were also tested and compared along with reference (altitude) icing conditions. In those tests, the Weber number-based scaling methods yielded results much closer to those observed at the reference icing conditions than the Reynolds number-based icing conditions. The test in the NASA IRT used a much larger, asymmetric airfoil with an ice protection system that more closely resembled designs used in commercial aircraft. Following the trends observed during the AIWT tests, the Weber number based scaling methods resulted in smaller runback ice than the Reynolds number based scaling, and the ice formed farther upstream.
