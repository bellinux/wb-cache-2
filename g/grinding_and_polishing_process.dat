Direct grinding of those generates more heat in the grinder, which is not desired in the process, as it reduces the hydration of the product. Through the heating, <b>grinding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>process,</b> the husk is separated from the endosperm halves and the refined guar split is obtained. Through the further grinding process, the refined guar split is then treated and converted into powder. The split manufacturing process yields husk and germ called “guar meal”, widely sold in the international market as cattle feed. It is high in protein and contains oil and albuminoids, about 50% in germ and about 25% in husks. The quality of the food-grade guar gum powder is defined from its particle size, rate of hydration, and microbial content.|$|E

High-toughness bioceramics can only be machined by <b>grinding</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>processes.</b> The aim of this study was to develop an automated process chain for the manufacturing of an all-ceramic knee implant. Methods: A five-axis machining process was developed for all-ceramic implant components.

Contact area resulting from a variety of component surface shapes, with a variety of levels of surface conformity, greatly influenced wear rate. Conclusions: It is possible to realize an all-ceramic knee endoprosthesis device, with a precise and affordable manufacturing process. The shape accuracy of the component surfaces, as specified by the design and achieved during the manufacturing process, has a substantial influence on the wear behavior of the prosthesis.

Fused silica samples (100 mm in diameter x 10 mm thick) were manufactured using the conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>process.</b> These processed samples are etched with different removal depth.

Second, four 2 -D PCMUT elements are positioned on 2 × 2 array formation {{in order to measure}} the inter-element acoustic crosstalk. The inter-cell acoustic coupling in a 2 -D PCMUT element results in the cancellation of the average pressure at certain lower frequency than the operating frequency. The symmetric and asymmetric inter-element interactions from the 2 × 2 2 -D PCMUT arrays are also analyzed by means of exciting all the elements simultaneously and applying a bipolar voltage pulse to one element, respectively.

In this study, we have experimentally characterized the morphology, number density, and depth distribution of various surface cracks as a function of various <b>grinding</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>processes</b> (blanchard, fixed abrasive grinding, loose abrasive, pitch <b>polishing</b> <b>and</b> pad <b>polishing).</b> Also, the effects of load, abrasive particle (size, distribution, foreign particles, geometry, velocity), and lap material (pitch, pad) were examined. The resulting data were evaluated in terms of indentation fracture mechanics and tribological interactions (science of interacting surfaces) leading to several models to explain crack distribution behavior of ground surfaces and to explain the characteristics of scratches formed during polishing. This project has greatly advanced the scientific knowledge of microscopic mechanical damage occurring during <b>grinding</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>and</b> has been of general interest. This knowledge-base has also enabled the design and optimization of surface finishing processes to create optical surfaces with far superior laser damage resistance. There are five major areas of scientific progress {{as a result of this}} LDRD. They are listed in Figure 1 and described briefly in this summary below. The details of this work are summarized through a number of published manuscripts which are included this LDRD Final Report. In the first area of grinding, we developed a technique to quantitatively and statistically measure the depth distribution of surface fractures (i. e., subsurface damage) in fused silica as function of various grinding processes using mixtures of various abrasive particles size distributions. The observed crack distributions were explained using a model that extended known, single brittle indentation models to an ensemble of loaded, sliding particles. The model illustrates the importance of the particle size distribution of the abrasive and its influence on the resulting crack distribution. The results of these studies are summarized in references 1 - 7. In the second area of polishing, we conducted a series of experiments showing the influence of rogue particles (i. e., particles in the polishing slurry that are larger than base particles) on the creation of scratches on polished surfaces. Scratches can be thought of a as a specific type of sub-surface damage. The characteristics (width, length, type of fractures, concentration) were explained in terms of the rogue particle size, the rogue particle material, and the viscoelastic properties of the lap. The results of these studies are summarized in references 6 - 7. In the third area of etching, we conducted experiments aimed at understanding the effect of HF:NH{sub 4 }F acid etching on surface fractures on fused silica. Etching can be used as a method: (a) to expose sub-surface mechanical damage, (b) to study the morphology of specific mechanical damage occurring by indentation, and (c) to convert a ground surface containing a high concentration of sub-surface mechanical damage into surface roughness. Supporting models have been developed to describe in detail the effect of etching on the morphology and evolution of surface cracks. The results of these studies are summarized in references 8 - 9. In the fourth area of scratch forensics or scratch fractography, a set of new scratch forensic rule-of-thumbs were developed in order to aid the optical fabricator and process engineer to interpret the cause of scratches and digs on surfaces. The details of how these rules were developed are described in each of the references included in this summary (1 - 9). Figure 2 provides as a summary of some of the more commonly used rules-of-thumbs that have been developed in this study.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a modified hot-embossing process to fabricate micro-triangular-pyramidal array (MTPA). First, a tungsten (W) steel mold (as the first mold) is manufactured by precision machining including optical projection <b>grinding,</b> lapping, <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> <b>processes.</b> The dimension of a triangular pyramid with acute angle of 85 on the W-steel mold is about 300 lm in width and 139 lm in height. The pitch between two triangular-pyramidal tips is about 170 lm. Then, only {{the portion of}} the tip area of the triangular-pyramidal patterns is transferred on bulk metallic glass (BMG, Mg 58 Cu 31 Y 11) using this mod-ified multi-step hot-embossing method to reduce the pattern size. With a position-adjustable mechanism, size-reduced concaved-shaped MTPA can be selectively formed, used as the secondary mold. In this way, not only can the size of triangular-pyramidal patterns on W-steel mold be reduced down on BMG, but also the tool arc between each triangular-pyramid on W-steel mold caused by machine tool can be eliminated. This is {{based on the fact that}} amorphous glass alloys contain no dislocation that can be responsible for yielding in crystalline materials. Thus, BMG is expected to be strong and hard enough to be used as a mold material. Then the secondary mold is used to emboss convex-shaped MTPA on PolymethylMethacrylate (PMMA) optical film. Experiments with different embossing times and embossing pressures are conducted and discussed. Large-sized triangular-pyramidal array on the W-steel mold has been successfully and selectively miniaturized on BMG, and then transferred on PMMA. Finally, this optical film of PMMAwith MTPA is packaged on light-emitting diode (LED) to improve its lighting uniformity and luminance. In comparison with commercial 3 M optical film (3 M Vikuiti TBEF 2 -T- 65 i), the film with MTPA shows a good optical performance...|$|R
