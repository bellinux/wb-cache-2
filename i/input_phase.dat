50|$|With recent device advances, newer {{forms of}} cyclo{{converters}} are being developed, such as matrix converters.

Any <b>input</b> <b>phase</b> and output phase can be connected together at any time without connecting any two switches from the same phase at the same time; otherwise this will cause a short circuit of the input phases.

50|$|Non-Gaussian {{statistics}} arise {{due to the}} nonlinear {{mapping of}} random initial conditions into output states. For example, modulation instability amplifies input noise, which ultimately leads to soliton formation. Also, in systems displaying heavy-tailed statistical properties, random input conditions often enter through a seemingly insignificant, nontrivial, or otherwise-hidden variable. Such is generally the case for optical rogue waves; for example, they can begin from a specific out-of-band noise component, which is usually very weak and unnoticed. Yet, in the output states, these minor input variations can be magnified into large potential swings in key observables. The latter may, therefore, exhibit substantial fluctuations for no readily apparent reason. Thus, the appearance of extreme statistics is often striking {{not only because of}} their counterintuitive probability assignments, but also because they frequently signify a nontrivial or unexpected sensitivity to initial conditions. It {{is important to recognize that}} rogue waves in both optics and hydrodynamics are classical phenomena and, therefore, intrinsically deterministic. However, determinism does not necessarily indicate that it is straightforward or practical to make useful predictions. Optical rogue waves and their statistical properties can be investigated in numerical simulations with the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a classical propagation equation that is also used to model supercontinuum generation and, more generally, pulse propagation in optical fiber. In such simulations, a source of input noise is needed to produce the stochastic output variations. Frequently, <b>input</b> <b>phase</b> noise with a power amplitude of one photon per mode is employed, corresponding to shot noise. Yet, noise levels beyond the one-photon-per-mode level are generally more experimentally realistic and often needed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a matrix converter. Matrix converters belong to the category of direct frequency converters. A converter does not contain DC-link and the output voltage is provided by direct switching of voltage from the <b>input</b> <b>phases.</b> This is enabled by 9 bidirectional switches, which are provided by anti-serial connection of 18 IGBT transistors. The absence of a DC-link is great advantage of the matrix converter, but it also increases the requirements on the converter control. For this reason a new prototype of a matrix converter is being developed with sophisticated modern components (FPGA, Power PC) equipped in the control part of the converter. The converter will be used for testing new control algorithms and commutation methods. ...|$|R

Simulations using multiconductor transmission line (MTL) theory have shown that the response of the MIMO streams and their spatial correlation is essentially determined by the cable characteristics, by the topology of the underlying LV line, and by the loads connected to the same phase.|$|R
