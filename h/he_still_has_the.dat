He marries off his younger sister, Daenerys Targaryen, whom he has psychologically and physically abused for years, to {{the leader of the}} Dothraki warrior tribe, Khal Drogo, in an exchange for an army to return to Westeros and take the throne. However, Daenerys' growing love for Drogo and newfound mental strength as the Khaleesi of the tribe mean Viserys' plans go unexpectedly and powerfully awry.|$|E

The Court of Claims of 1953 granted the traditional right of the bishop to accompany the sovereign at the coronation, reflecting his seniority.|$|E
25|$|Ian puts Bobby in {{a private}} school, hoping that it will help with his anger problems. However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his {{restaurant}} to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest. Ian eventually decides not to sell, meaning Bobby must leave the school, {{even though he is}} happy there and doing well. Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy, within earshot of everyone in the pub. After Bobby is questioned about the assault, he confesses to the police that he killed Lucy. They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> murder weapon.|$|E

25|$|On stage 3 of the Tour de Suisse, Sagan {{showed that}} <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ability to climb {{with the best}} in the sport. After making the {{selection}} on the category one climb, Sagan was able to distance himself along with Rui Costa, Roman Kreuziger and Mathias Frank on the final wet and narrow descent. The four held off {{the rest of the field}} and Sagan took the stage victory. Sagan cemented his victory in the points classification by taking the eighth stage, which was flatter and more suited to the sprinters. He got the best of Daniele Bennati and Philippe Gilbert. He then went on to win the Slovak Road Race Championships for the third time, stating that he would be happy to harbor the national emblem on his jersey for the Tour de France. At the Tour, Sagan scored numerous second positions before winning stage 7 to Albi, after his team worked to shed the pure sprinters on the Category 2 Col de la Croix de Mounis. He outsprinted the select group he was part of, crossing the line before John Degenkolb. Sagan retained the green jersey to Paris and dyed his beard green to underline that victory. He then went on to win the sprints classification and numerous stages in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge (4 stage wins) and the Tour of Alberta (2 stage wins). Sagan got short of success in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec where he accelerated strongly on one of the final climbs but faded in sight of the finishing line. He compensated two days later by taking victory in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, escaping the leading group on a climb with five kilometers to go and winning solo.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} in a fictional world, {{primarily}} upon a continent called Westeros, with one storyline occurring on another continent to the east known as Essos. Like the novel, the season initially focuses on the family of nobleman Eddard Stark, who is asked to become chief advisor to his king and longtime friend, Robert Baratheon. [...] Ned must find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from their rivals the Lannisters. He uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that his predecessor died trying to expose.

[...] Vietnamese newspaper Thanh Nien Daily remarked: [...] "Red Cliff’s action is epic.

He hitches a lift with a man named Russell and his sister Fenchurch (nicknamed [...] "Fenny"). Russell explains that Fenny became delusional after worldwide mass hysteria, in which everyone hallucinated [...] "big yellow spaceships" [...] (the Vogon destructor ships that [...] "demolished" [...] the Earth). Arthur becomes curious about Fenchurch, but they reach his home before he can ask more questions. Inside his still standing home, Arthur finds a gift-wrapped bowl inscribed with the words [...] "So long and thanks", which he uses for his Babel Fish. Arthur considers that Fenchurch is somehow connected to him and to the Earth's destruction. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ability to fly whenever he lets his thoughts wander.|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, [...] "he flying {{action has}} a casual flip buoyancy, {{and the movie}} does get you rooting for Peter. The appeal of this {{particular}} Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, and he keeps getting up." [...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's light tone and performances, writing: [...] "Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date. That does come with a caveat that Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man 2 are going for different things and both are great. But, tonally, I just love this incarnation of a Peter Parker who just loves being Spider-Man." [...] The New York Timess Manohla Dargis stated, [...] "Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more of a kid than a man. Even with his budding superpowers, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager {{still trying to figure}} out this world." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a [...] "mixed" [...] review, praising the stunt work and calling Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture [...] "one of the strongest, most sympathetic villains of the entire series," [...] but criticizing the direction by Jon Watts as [...] "unevenly orchestrated".|$|E

But he has no race-horses. His friend, Dot, purchased the lot of them out and out, soon after the famous Derby; and a very good bargain, for himself, he is said to have made.

60|$|The social animals which {{stand at}} the bottom of the scale are guided almost exclusively, and those which stand higher in the scale are largely guided, in the aid which they give to the members of the same community, by special instincts; but they are {{likewise}} in part impelled by mutual love and sympathy, assisted apparently by some amount of reason. Although man, as just remarked, has no special instincts to tell him how to aid his fellow-men, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> impulse, and with his improved intellectual faculties would naturally be much guided in this respect by reason and experience. Instinctive sympathy would, also, cause him to value highly the approbation of his fellow-men; for, as Mr. Bain has clearly shewn,[120] the love of praise and the strong feeling of glory, and the still stronger horror of scorn and infamy, “are due to the workings of sympathy.” Consequently man would be greatly influenced by the wishes, approbation, and blame of his fellow-men, as expressed by their gestures and language. Thus the social instincts, which must have been acquired by man in a very rude state, and probably even by his early ape-like progenitors, still give the impulse to many of his best actions; but his actions are largely determined by the expressed wishes and judgment of his fellow-men, and unfortunately still oftener by his own strong, selfish desires. But as the feelings of love and sympathy and the power of self-command become strengthened by habit, and as the power of reasoning becomes clearer so that man can appreciate the justice of the judgments of his fellow-men, he will feel himself impelled, independently of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, to certain lines of conduct. He may then say, I am the supreme judge of my own conduct, and in the words of Kant, I will not in my own person violate the dignity of humanity.|$|E

6000|$|But in all {{the rest}} there is a {{wonderful}} invigoration and enlargement. The genius of romance has increased to an extraordinary degree in power, if not in simplicity. Its shoulders have grown broader, its voice louder and more sustained; and if it has lost {{a little on the}} sentimental side, it has gained prodigiously, not only in animal vigour, but, above all, in knowledge of human nature, and a brave and joyous candour in shewing it. The poet takes a universal, an acute, and, upon the whole, a cheerful view, like the sun itself, of all which the sun looks on; and readers are charmed to see a knowledge at once so keen and so happy. Herein lies the secret of Ariosto's greatness; which is great, not because it has the intensity of Dante, or the incessant thought and passion of Shakspeare, or the dignified imagination of Milton, to all of whom he is far inferior in sustained excellence,--but because he is like very Nature herself. Whether great, small, serious, pleasureable, or even indifferent, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> life, ease, and beauty of the operations of the daily planet. Even where he seems dull and common-place, his brightness and originality at other times make it look like a good-natured condescension to our own common habits of thought and discourse; as though he did it but on purpose to leave nothing unsaid that could bring him within the category of ourselves. His charming manner intimates that, instead of taking thought, he chooses to take pleasure with us, and compare old notes; and we are delighted that he does us so much honour, and makes, as it were, Ariostos of us all. He is Shakspearian in going all lengths with Nature as he found her, not blinking the fact of evil, yet finding a [...] "soul of goodness" [...] in it, and, at the same time, never compromising the worth of noble and generous qualities. His young and handsome Medoro is a pitiless slayer of his enemies; but they were his master's enemies, and he would have lost his life, even to preserve his dead body. His Orlando, for all his wisdom and greatness, runs mad for love of a coquette, who triumphs over warriors and kings, only to fall in love herself with an obscure lad. His kings laugh with all their hearts, like common people; his mourners weep like such unaffected children of sorrow, that they must needs [...] "swallow some of their tears."[45] His heroes, on the arrival of intelligence that excites them, leap out of bed and write letters before they dress, from natural impatience, thinking nothing of their [...] "dignity." [...] When Astolfo blows the magic horn which drives every body out of the castle of Atlantes, [...] "not a mouse" [...] stays behind;--not, as Hoole and such critics think, because the poet is here writing ludicrously, but because he uses the same image seriously, to give an idea of desolation, as Shakspeare in Hamlet does to give that of silence, when [...] "not a mouse is stirring." [...] Instead of being mere comic writing, such incidents are in the highest epic taste of the meeting of extremes,--of the impartial eye with which Nature regards high and low. So, give Ariosto his hippogriff, and other marvels with which he has enriched the stock of romance, and Nature takes as much care of the verisimilitude of their actions, as if she had made them herself. His hippogriff returns, like a common horse, to the stable to which he has been accustomed. His enchanter, who is gifted with the power of surviving decapitation and pursuing the decapitator so long as a fated hair remains on his head, turns deadly pale in the face when it is scalped, and falls lifeless from his horse. His truth, indeed, is so genuine, {{and at the same time}} his style is so unaffected, sometimes so familiar in its grace, and sets us so much at ease in his company, that the familiarity is in danger of bringing him into contempt with the inexperienced, and the truth of being considered old and obvious, because the mode of its introduction makes it seem an old acquaintance. When Voltaire was a young man, and (to Anglicise a favourite Gallic phrase) fancied he had profounded every thing deep and knowing, he thought nothing of Ariosto. Some years afterwards he took him for the first of grotesque writers, but nothing more. At last he pronounced him equally [...] "entertaining and sublime, and humbly apologised for his error." [...] Foscolo quotes this passage from the Dictionnaire Philosophique; and adds another from Sir Joshua Reynolds, in which the painter speaks of a similar inability on his own part, when young, to enjoy the perfect nature of Raphael, and the admiration and astonishment which, in his riper years, he grew to feel for it.[46] ...|$|E
