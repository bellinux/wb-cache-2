5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz. More than 660lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Second Dutch War, Charles {{dismissed}} Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} {{running for the}} United States House of Representatives from Maine’s 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P.

5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire {{as part of the}} final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam.

5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort {{resulted}} in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
