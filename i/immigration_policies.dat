In this study the <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> program or party program was {{analyzed}} through idea analysis to find out what <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> interventions they have come with, and if they want to assimilate or integrate immigrants. Materials used for the study are the <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> programs and party programs. Even scientific journals and articles have been used, in both national and international level. An analysis instrument, by Carl Dahlström (2004), has been used in this study.

5|$|The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country's <b>immigration</b> <b>policies,</b> {{allowing}} {{foreigners to}} settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas. People flocked to the area; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7,800Mexicans and 30,000English-speaking people primarily from the United States. Among the immigrants was William Barret Travis, an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer. An avid reader, Travis often devoured a novel in a single day. His taste ran primarily to romantic adventure and history, especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Benjamin Disraeli and the historical works of Herodotus.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} framework for analyzing the problems associated to unilateral <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> in receiving countries and for evaluating the grounds for reform of international institutions governing immigration. We build a model with multiple destination countries and show that <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> in one country is influenced by measures adopted abroad as migrants choose where to locate (in part) in response to differences in <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> This interdependence {{gives rise to a}} leakage effect of <b>immigration</b> <b>policy,</b> an international externality well documented in the empirical literature. In this environment, <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> becomes strategic and unilateral behavior may lead to coordination failures, where receiving countries are stuck in welfare inferior equilibria.

40|$|Are {{public attitudes}} toward <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> in the United States driven by {{economic}} or non-economic concerns?

This paper challenges the contention that economic motivations play little or {{no role in the}} formation of <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> preferences. Drawing on recent work in political economy, I argue that individual preferences over <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> reflect economic and non-economic concerns – both broadly rooted in considerations of individual self-interest. While affective orientations toward ethnic groups and prejudice clearly underlie public attitudes toward <b>immigration</b> <b>policy,</b> analysts err in discounting an economic interpretation of <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> preferences.

40|$|Immigration plays a {{key role}} in {{international}} politics and contributes socially, politically and economically to the functions of a state. Understanding and analysing the <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> of a nation is therefore very important; as it allows knowledge to be gained regarding what factors can influence a nation’s <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> to change and how these factors can be identified. This thesis focuses on five theories that are recognised internationally as attempting to identify the factors that can influence <b>immigration</b> control <b>policy</b> change and therefore explain why <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> does change over time. These five theories are then compared to ten specific <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> changes that have occurred within New Zealand since 1964 in order to discover which theory best explains and identifies the key influences. In a world that is being made smaller through globalisation, <b>immigration</b> and <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> continues to maintain an important status in international relations and politics. This thesis aims at filling the gap in immigration research within New Zealand by analysing the factors that influence <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> to change, rather than focusing on whether immigrants themselves are an economic benefit or detriment to the economy of New Zealand. Immigration is not a monolithic term, and only by analysing how <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> has been influenced in the past can future changes to the <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> of New Zealand can be made with knowledge and understanding...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims {{to reveal}} the decisive factors and presumptions of Lithuania’s and Latvia’s <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> formation. The {{theoretical}} model is constructed by using <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> theories, presumptions and strategies, possible models of incorporation, role of social actors, and influence of social (non) security. Based on this theoretical model an analysis of Lithuania’s and Latvia’s <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> was attempted. The target group {{of this article is}} not citizens of EU countries, but integration processes which are connected with, or involved in, the conception of <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> The historically created genesis of society (homogeneous and formed on ethnocentric basis) and presumptions of identity formation affect the formation of a strict <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> in Latvia and Lithuania, in order to ensure the social security of society and to maintain ethnic and cultural identity. Temporary <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> is institutionalized by realizing statutes of circular <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> In this way the probability of constant immigration is reduced by trying to protect the homogeneity and social security of society.

40|$|Influential immigrant-receiving country {{actors have}} long {{articulated}} {{the need for}} a comprehensive approach to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> However, {{even in the midst of}} <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> failure, immigrant receiving countries have tended to not implement comprehensive approaches. This thesis classifies comprehensive approaches into regional and unilateral approaches and asks: what factors explain immigrant receiving country marginalization of regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> with immigrant-sending countries? Three factors can explain immigrant-receiving country marginalization of regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> with immigrant-sending countries: political salience, interests and institutions. This thesis's explanatory model incorporates the political salience of immigration as the independent variable, interests and institutions as mediating variables, and the marginalization of regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> as the dependent variable. First, this thesis hypothesizes that during shifts from low to high political salience of immigration, immigrant-receiving countries exhibit a tendency to marginalize regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> Second, the relative marginalization of regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> across liberal democratic immigrant-receiving countries can be explained by key constraints: (1) convergence in political, economic and legal interests held by influential immigrant-receiving and immigrant-sending country actors towards regional approaches to immigration policy; (2) insulation of immigrant-receiving country immigration agencies through internal constraints, including the immigrant-receiving country regime type; and (3) insulation of immigrant receiving country immigration agencies through external constraints, including bilateral and regional institutionalization. This thesis applies the Mexico-US and Morocco-Spain dyads to the explanatory model and explores their <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> experiences utilizing a process-tracing approach that considers political discourse and policy implementation stages of the public policy cycle. Ultimately, there is a relationship between the political salience of immigration and the marginalization of regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> Interest and institution-based constraints help to explain why Spain did not marginalize regional approaches to <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> with Morocco to the same extent as the US with Mexico.
