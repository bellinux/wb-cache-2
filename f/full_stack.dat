25|$|According to an {{agreement}} between the state legislature {{and the state department}} of transportation, STAN (Statewide Transportation Acceleration Needs) funds were used to build a partial interchange at Bell Road in summer 2010, several years before previously intended. In mid-2011 the segment between Happy Valley Parkway and I-17 was completed as a four-lane highway with an interchange at Lone Mountain Parkway completed but initially closed to the public. Motorists still have to pass through signaled ramp junctions at the I-17 Black Canyon Freeway until a <b>full</b> <b>stack</b> interchange is built between that route and Loop 303.|$|E
2500|$|An {{amplifier}} stack {{consists of}} an amplifier head atop a speaker cabinet—a head {{on top of one}} cabinet is commonly called a half stack, a head atop two cabinets a <b>full</b> <b>stack.</b> The cabinet that the head sits on often has an angled top in front, while the lower cabinet of a <b>full</b> <b>stack</b> has a straight front. The first version of the Marshall stack was an amp head on an 8×12 cabinet, meaning a single speaker cabinet containing eight 12" [...] guitar speakers. After six of these cabinets were made, the cabinet arrangement was changed to an amp head on two 4×12 (four 12" [...] speakers) cabinets to make the cabinets more transportable. Some touring metal and rock bands have used a large array of guitar speaker cabinets for their impressive appearance. Some of these arrangements include only the fronts of speaker cabinets mounted on a large frame.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance {{analysis of a}} 5 kWel high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell (HT-PEFC) stack. Stack design and sizing is adapted to auxiliary power unit (APU) applications assuming the use of middle distillates. The parameter study comprises the variation of the fuel type (reformate, with pure hydrogen as a reference), the stoichiometry on the anode (1. 3 – 2. 7) and cathode (1. 25 – 4. 0) sides and the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration (0. 9 – 3. 5 %) in the reformate. At 0. 5 A cm− 2, a coolant inlet temperature of 160 °C, stoichiometric factors of 1. 3 on the anode and 2 on the cathode side and reformate operation, two interconnected <b>full</b> <b>stacks</b> produced 5 kW of electric power. The focus of the present work is {{an examination of the}} robustness of the <b>full</b> <b>stacks</b> through an analysis of the 70 single cell voltages. By comparison to other published operational parameter studies, this paper makes a significant contribution to the application of the methodology not to single cells or short stacks, but to a stack with technical relevance in the high power class...|$|R
