They may be chronic, although painless, {{and can lead to}} strangulation (loss of blood supply), obstruction (<b>kinking</b> of intestine), or both. Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness. Nausea, vomiting, or fever may occur in these cases due to bowel obstruction.

They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and <b>kinking.</b> When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.|$|E
25|$|When TBP binds to a TATA box {{within the}} DNA, it distorts the DNA by {{inserting}} amino acid side-chains between base pairs, partially unwinding the helix, and doubly <b>kinking</b> it. The distortion is accomplished through {{a great amount}} of surface contact between the protein and DNA. TBP binds with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone through positively charged lysine and arginine amino acid residues. The sharp bend in the DNA is produced through projection of four bulky phenylalanine residues into the minor groove. As the DNA bends, its contact with TBP increases, thus enhancing the DNA-protein interaction.|$|E
40|$|<b>Kinks</b> are {{functionally}} important structural features {{found in}} the alpha-helices of many proteins, particularly membrane proteins. Structurally, they are points at which a helix abruptly changes direction. Previous <b>kink</b> definition and identification methods often disagree with one another. Here I describe three novel methods to characterise <b>kinks,</b> which improve on existing approaches. First, <b>Kink</b> Finder, a computational method that consistently locates <b>kinks</b> and estimates the error in the <b>kink</b> angle. Second the B statistic, a statistically robust method for identifying <b>kinks.</b> Third, Alpha Helices Assessed by Humans, a crowdsourcing approach that provided a gold-standard data set on which to train and compare existing <b>kink</b> identification methods. In this thesis, I show that <b>kinks</b> are a feature of long -helices in both soluble and membrane proteins, rather than just transmembrane -helices. Characteristics of <b>kinks</b> in {{the two types of}} proteins are similar, with Proline being the dominant feature in both types of protein. In soluble proteins, <b>kinked</b> helices also have a clear structural preference in that they typically point into the solvent. I also explored the conservation of <b>kinks</b> in homologous proteins. I found examples of conserved and non-conserved <b>kinks</b> in both the helix pairs and the helix families. Helix pairs with non-conserved <b>kinks</b> generally have less similar sequences than helix pairs with conserved <b>kinks.</b> I identified helix families that show highly conserved <b>kinks,</b> and families that contain non-conserved <b>kinks,</b> suggesting that some <b>kinks</b> may be flexible points in protein structures.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the linear density of <b>kinks</b> on a cosmic string network is examined, and new possibilities about {{the behavior of the}} string network are considered. These include (1) allowing kinky regions to selectively chop off; (2) allowing the <b>kink</b> density to determine the lifetime of kinks; and (3) allowing the mean distance between <b>kinks</b> to determine the length of newly formed loops. Under certain of these assumptions, one obtains results also found by Hindmarsh and by Quashnock and Piran. If the average <b>kink</b> density on loops is more than 3 times the average <b>kink</b> density on long strings, then loop production prevents the buildup of <b>kinks</b> on long strings, the mean distance between <b>kinks</b> scales proportional to the horizon length, and the distance between <b>kinks</b> is about the horizon length. In contrast, if the average <b>kink</b> density on loops is less than 3 times that on long strings, then the <b>kink</b> density only scales at late time due to <b>kink</b> decay, and the distance between <b>kinks</b> is at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the horizon length...|$|R
2500|$|Edge: A {{strip of}} metal, tuned {{normally}} to just less than 90-degrees, {{that runs the}} length of {{either side of the}} board. This sharp edge is necessary to be able to produce enough friction to ride on ice, and the radius of the edge directly affects the radius of carving turns, and in turn the responsiveness of the board. <b>Kinking,</b> rusting, or general dulling of the edge will significantly hinder the ability for the edge to grip the snow, so it is important that this feature is maintained. However, many riders who spend a fair amount of their time grinding park rails, and especially handrails, will actually use a detuning stone or another method to intentionally dull their edges, either entirely or only in certain areas. [...] This helps to avoid [...] "catching" [...] on any tiny burrs or other obstructions that may exist or be formed on rails, boxes, and other types of grind. [...] Catching on a rail can, more than likely, result in a potentially serious crash, particularly should it occur on a handrail or more advanced rail set-up. [...] In addition, it's relatively common for freestyle riders to [...] "detune" [...] the edges around the board's contact points. [...] This practice can help to reduce the chances of the rider catching an edge in a choppy or rutted-out jump landing or similar situation. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that drastic edge detuning can be near-impossible to fully reverse and will significantly impede board control & the ability to hold an edge in harder-packed snow. [...] One area where this can be quite detrimental is in a half-pipe, where well-sharpened edges are often crucially important for cutting through the hard, sometimes icy, walls.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a {{first passage time}} Markov chain analysis of rare events in kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and demonstrate how this analysis {{may be used to}} enhance kMC simulations of dislocation glide. Dislocation glide is described by the <b>kink</b> mechanism, which involves double <b>kink</b> nucleation, <b>kink</b> migration and kink–kink annihilation. Double <b>kinks</b> that nucleate on straight dislocations are unstable at small <b>kink</b> separations and tend to recombine immediately following nucleation. A very small fraction (< 0. 001) of nucleating double <b>kinks</b> survive to grow to a stable <b>kink</b> separation. The present approach replaces all of the events that lead up to the formation of a stable <b>kink</b> with a simple numerical calculation of the time required for stable <b>kink</b> formation. In this paper, we treat the double <b>kink</b> nucleation process as a temporally homogeneous birth–death Markov process and present a first passage time analysis of the Markov process in order to calculate the nucleation rate of a double <b>kink</b> with a stable <b>kink</b> separation. We discuss two methods to calculate the first passage time; one computes the distribution and the average of the first passage time, while the other uses a recursive relation to calculate the average first passage time. The average first passage times calculated by both approaches are shown to be in excellent agreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations for four idealized cases of double <b>kink</b> nucleation. Finally, we apply this approach to double <b>kink</b> nucleation on a screw dislocation in molybdenum and obtain the rates for formation of stable double <b>kinks</b> as a function of applied stress and temperature. Equivalent kMC simulations are too inefficient to be performed using commonly available computational resources...|$|R
