40|$|Polymer-based nanocomposites (PNCs) display {{fascinating}} functionalities to {{be useful}} in electrical switching applications like circuit breakers, switch gears, etc. These PNCs are fabricated by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) into a polymer by in-situ polymerization. When the PNCs interrupt the high energetic fault currents generate between the two contacts in a circuit breaker, they outgas (ablation) chemical species and cooling gases, which change the thermodynamic properties of the arcing environment leading to quench the <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> quickly. Two PNCs are fabricated with different wt% of oleic acid modified CuO NPs and a polymer matrix i. e. poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA). These PNCs are tested with the <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> of a prospective current of 1. 6 kA generated in the test-setup. The <b>electrical</b> signals (<b>arc</b> current and voltage) and computed dissipated enegy i. e., ∫() () help to understand the effect of PNCs on the <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs.</b> In addition to that, the computed joule integral and mass loss of the PNCs due to outgassing is reported. The re-depositions of the chemical species are analyzed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the morphological changes {{on the surface of}} outgassed PNCs are analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results help to understand the effect of PNCs on the arc interruption process in circuit breakers. Qc 20170303 </p...|$|R

25|$|High-voltage TEMs require ultra-high vacuums on {{the range}} of 10−7 to 10−9 Pa to prevent the {{generation}} of an <b>electrical</b> <b>arc,</b> particularly at the TEM cathode. As such for higher voltage TEMs a third vacuum system may operate, with the gun isolated from the main chamber either by gate valves or a differential pumping aperture – a small hole that prevents the diffusion of gas molecules into the higher vacuum gun area faster than they can be pumped out. For these very low pressures, either an ion pump or a getter material is used.|$|E
500|$|In 1800, Sir Humphry Davy {{discovered}} the [...] "short-pulse" [...] <b>electrical</b> <b>arc</b> and presented his results in 1801. In 1802, Russian scientist Vasily Petrov created the continuous electric arc, and subsequently published [...] "News of Galvanic-Voltaic Experiments" [...] in 1803, {{in which he}} described experiments carried out in 1802. Of great importance in this work was the description of a stable arc discharge and the indication of its possible use for many applications, one being melting metals. In 1808, Davy, who was unaware of Petrov's work, re{{discovered the}} continuous electric arc. In 1881–82 inventors Nikolai Benardos (Russian) and Stanisław Olszewski (Polish) created the first electric arc welding method known as carbon arc welding using carbon electrodes. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 1800s by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin (1890). Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released a coated metal electrode in Britain, which gave a more stable arc. In 1905, Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed using a three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C. J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.|$|E

50|$|Arc welding {{is one of}} {{the many}} types of fusion welding. Arc welding joins two pieces of metal {{together}} by using an intermediate filler metal. The way this works is by completing an electrical circuit to create an <b>electrical</b> <b>arc.</b> This <b>electrical</b> <b>arc</b> is 6500oF in its center. This <b>electrical</b> <b>arc</b> is created at the tip of the filler metal. As the arc melts the metal it is moved either by a person or a machine along the gap in the metals creating a bond. This method is very common as it is typically done with a hand held machine. Arc welding machines are portable and can be brought on to job sites and in hard to reach areas. Arc welding is also the most common method of underwater welding. Electrical arcs form between points separated by a gas. In the process of underwater welding a bubble of gas is blown around the area being welded so that an <b>electrical</b> <b>arc</b> may form. Underwater welding has many applications. Ship hulls are repaired and oil rigs are maintained with underwater arc welding.|$|E

50|$|An {{arc flash}} is {{the light and}} heat {{produced}} from an electric arc supplied with sufficient electrical energy to cause substantial damage, harm, fire, or injury. <b>Electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> experience negative incremental resistance, which causes the electrical resistance to decrease as the arc temperature increases. Therefore, as the arc develops and gets hotter the resistance drops, drawing more and more current (runaway) until {{some part of the}} system melts, trips, or evaporates, providing enough distance to break the circuit and extinguish the <b>arc.</b> <b>Electrical</b> <b>arcs,</b> when well controlled and fed by limited energy, produce very bright light, and are used in arc lamps (enclosed, or with open electrodes), for welding, plasma cutting, and other industrial applications. Welding arcs can easily turn steel into a liquid with an average of only 24 DC volts. When an uncontrolled arc forms at high voltages, and especially where large supply-wires or high-amperage conductors are used, arc flashes can produce deafening noises, supersonic concussive-forces, super-heated shrapnel, temperatures far greater than the Sun's surface, and intense, high-energy radiation capable of vaporizing nearby materials.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} new {{photoelectric}} measurements that throw {{light on the}} effect of arcing in air on the electron work function (EWF) of contact pastilles made of pure silver [Ag (99. 999 %) ], silver-nickel alloy [Ag-Ni (60 / 40) ], silver-tungsten alloy [Ag-W (50 / 50) ], and silver-tungsten carbide [Ag-WC (50 / 50) ]. The influence of industrial treatment (polishing, mechanical shocks, and <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> in air) of pure metals and silver-metal alloys on their EWF is experimentally investigated. To study the effects of arcing on the EWF, the metallic samples were subjected to <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> in air, at atmospheric pressure, and room temperature, after that, they have been introduced into the vacuum chamber of an experimental ultrahigh vacuum setup for EWF measurements. Fowler's method of isothermal curves was used for the measurement of the EWF by the photoelectric effect. Contacts were mounted in a contactor working repetitively in air (laboratory atmosphere). A cycle of arcing consisted in opening contacts on charging, with production of an electric arc with adjustable duration, and closing a few seconds after arc extinction at zero voltage. When subjected to 500 arcs, the EWF for Ag contacts is $ 4. 50 ± 0. 03 $ eV at room temperature, while for virgin Ag contacts, it was 4. 30 ± 0. 03 eV. The increase in the EWF is due to the progressive inclusion of silver oxide in the Ag contact surface during arcing in air. The conditioned (500 arcs) silver [...] metal alloys studied in this paper exhibit the same electronic emission behavior, namely, arcing in air increases their EWF. We demonstrated that the electromechanical conditioning by successive <b>electrical</b> <b>arcs</b> affects the photo-EW...|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} arc has a non-linear relationship between current and voltage.
