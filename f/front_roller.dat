5000|$|Bicycle rollers are {{a type of}} bicycle trainer {{that make}} it {{possible}} to ride a bicycle indoors without moving forward. However, unlike other types of bicycle trainers, rollers do not attach to the bicycle frame, and the rider must balance him or herself on the rollers while training. Bicycle rollers normally consist of three cylinders, drums, or [...] "rollers" [...] (two for the rear wheel and one for the front), on top of which the bicycle rides. A belt connects the middle roller to the <b>front</b> <b>roller,</b> causing the front wheel of the bicycle to spin when the bicycle is pedaled. The spacing of bicycle rollers can usually be adjusted to match the bicycle's wheelbase. Generally, the <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> is adjusted to be slightly ahead of the hub of the front wheel.|$|E
50|$|The splash-lubricated {{crankshaft}} (pressure fed on some sports models) {{at first}} ran in two bearings (two ball bearings at the <b>front,</b> <b>roller</b> at the back) changing to three in 1936. An electric starter was fitted from November 1923. The early cars used magneto ignition, {{but this was}} changed to coil in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to worsted yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning worsted yarns is the worsted mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and <b>front</b> <b>rollers.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|R
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back <b>rollers</b> to faster <b>front</b> <b>rollers,</b> and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between the <b>front</b> and back <b>rollers</b> are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by {{a second set of}} boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the <b>front</b> <b>rollers,</b> draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R
50|$|Driven by a rider, {{it has a}} wide, <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> that {{absorbs the}} water, {{transfers}} it to a storage tank, and allows it to be discharged in a safe location. Some water hogs can suck off excess water {{at a rate of}} 200 gallons per minute and throw it as far as 100 feet away from the machine. It is designed so that it will not damage the turf.|$|E
50|$|Available {{accessories}} are mudguards, {{front and}} rear folding racks, bags, lighting sets and some upmarket extra components sold in Singapore and Hong Kong, like gas suspension units. Two optional rear racks are available, the SL Carrier and the Expedition Carrier. The former mounts directly to the swingarm, and allows only {{the use of a}} rack-top bag. The latter is a folding 16mm tubular rack mounted on pivots on both the main frame and the swingarm, which allows use of small panniers (e.g. Ortlieb <b>Front</b> <b>Roller)</b> when mudguards (fenders) are fitted. The mounting pivots for this rack have only been fitted to frames since 2003. Both racks are available with rollers which allows the Birdy to roll when folded.|$|E
50|$|The {{bar mine}} {{was used by}} small {{detachments}} of special forces of the British Army during the Gulf War in 1991. A number were captured from Kuwaiti Army stocks by the Iraqi Army in 1990, and subsequently used by {{them in the same}} conflict. It was reported that they disabled a number of M60 Patton tanks and other armoured vehicles belonging to the United States Marine Corps, even when these were fitted with mine-clearing ploughs. Unless the plough struck the mine squarely in the centre, the mine would often be rotated into a position in which it would pass between the tines of the plough, then blow up the track and <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> of the tank.|$|E
25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the ring spinning frame. The passage of the yarn from the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of spinning frames. When the yarn leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and roller nip, thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|R
40|$|The process {{device for}} fiber yarn comprises: besides the {{traditional}} ring spinner, a false twisting device between the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> and the feeding channel of the spinner {{to control the}} inner arrangement structure and stress distribution of one-ply yarn to let the product has controllable residual torque or no torque; a drive device coupled to drive the former device running.

50|$|Steam rollers, on {{the other}} hand, had smooth rear wheels and a <b>roller</b> at the <b>front.</b> The <b>roller</b> {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} adjacent wide cylinders supported at both ends. This replaced the separate wheels and axle of a traction engine.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conventional}} arrangement, the <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> is mounted centrally, {{forward of the}} chimney. In order to allow enough clearance from the boiler (and hence a larger front roll), the smokebox is extended forward substantially at the top to incorporate a support plate on which to mount the bearing for the roller assembly. This gives the distinctive, hooded look {{to the front of}} a steam roller. It also necessitates a different design of smokebox door - it has to hinge up or down, rather than opening sideways, due to the limited access available. Access to the boiler tubes for cleaning is limited and the brush usually has to be inserted through the small gap between the top of the roll and the fork.|$|E
5000|$|Ashes and soot {{which may}} {{be present in the}} smoke are often {{deposited}} in the smokebox. The front of the smokebox has a door which is opened to remove these deposits {{at the end of each}} locomotive's working day. The handle(s) must be tightened fully to prevent air leaks, which would reduce the draw on the fire and can also allow any unburnt char at the bottom of the smokebox to catch fire there. Some smokebox doors have a single handle in the form of a wheel; many British-built locomotives have a pair of smokebox door handles resembling the hands of a clock; other designs also exist. On many steamrollers an extension to the body of the smokebox also houses the bearing which supports the <b>front</b> <b>roller.</b> Due to limitations of space, these rollers usually have a drop-down flap instead of a circular smokebox door.|$|E
5000|$|Wyman {{used his}} 1902 California machine for his {{crossing}} of the United States. The California had a , [...] four-stroke engine attached to an ordinary diamond-frame bicycle. Wyman's machine was equipped with 28 x 1.5 in. tires, wooden rims, a leading-link front suspension fork, a Garford spring saddle, a Duck Brake Company <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> brake, and a 1902-patent Atherton rear coaster brake. A leather belt-drive with a spring-loaded idler pulley directly connected the engine output shaft to the rear wheel. Using a standard steel bicycle frame, the California weighed approximately [...] without rider, and was capable of approximately 25 mph using the 30-octane gasoline of the day, {{with a range of}} 75 to 100 mi. Throttle control was not yet perfected, and engine revolutions were mainly controlled by means of a spark timing mechanism. The wick-type carburetor was crude, consisting of a metal box with internal baffles stuffed with cotton batting. With no float chamber, the rider had to open the gasoline tap periodically to admit fuel into the carburetor.|$|E
50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. Thread guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|R
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Genetic {{programming}} {{was used}} to find out a mathematical model for drafting force from drafting process parameters on the drawing frame, which fits the experimental data as much as possible.

25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off <b>rollers</b> to the <b>front</b> <b>rollers</b> of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} area in the spinning process of staple yarns. Its geometry influences the distribution of fiber tension in the spinning triangle and the properties of spun yarns. In earlier theoretical models, the spinning tension of the yarn acting on the convergence point {{is assumed to be}} perpendicular to the nip line of <b>front</b> <b>rollers.</b> This assumption is reasonable {{in the study of the}} conventional ring spinning triangle, but may not be appropriate for modified ring spinning systems in which the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Thus in this paper a new theoretical model is proposed by considering the inclination angle of the spinning tension. Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, the theoretical model quantitatively describes the fiber tension distribution and its relationships with the spinning parameters, shape of the spinning triangle and the inclination angle of yarn spinning tension. As an application of the proposed method, spinning triangles of a modified ring spinning system were investigated under various spinning parameters. The fiber tension distributions in the spinning triangle both with and without fiber buckling were numerically simulated and the results were compared with those from our earlier model. In addition, the properties of spun yarns produced by the modified system were evaluated and analyzed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in the spinning process of yarn. Its geometry influences the fiber tension distribution and thus affects the properties of spun yarns. In conventional ring spinning, on the one hand, the spinning triangles are often asymmetric due to the frictional contacts of fibers with the bottom roller, which interferes with the twist propagation into the spinning triangle zone, and thus leads to the migration of the axis fiber at the <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> nip. On the other hand, the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Therefore, in this paper, a theoretical model of the fiber tension distributions in the general spinning triangle has been proposed by considering both the inclination angle of the spinning tension and the migration of the axis fiber at the <b>front</b> <b>roller</b> nip according {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy. Two shape parameters were introduced to describe the skew level of the geometry of the spinning triangle in the analysis. The effects of shapes of the spinning triangle on the fiber tension distributions were investigated. The results show that the fiber tension distribution at the spinning triangle tends to more non-uniformity with increasing the asymmetry of the spinning triangle. The effects of both shape par-ameters on the fiber tension distributions are similar under the assumption that the spinning triangle height H is constant. In addition, a more long-narrow shape of the spinning triangle shows more uniform fiber distributions. Keyword...|$|E
