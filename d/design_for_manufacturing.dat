5000|$|<b>Design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> {{is based}} on the premise that product and process design is an ongoing {{activity}} and not a one-time activity; therefore <b>design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. [...] <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or Six Sigma approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> also relates to system thinking as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs. ® (Munro & Associates) drives prevention of waste by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of Lean Design ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team. Initial studies of the Japanese approach to <b>design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> noted four principles; leadership of projects by a shusa (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and simultaneous development between engineering and manufacturing. Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the Toyota <b>design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology. As the practice of <b>design</b> <b>for</b> lean <b>manufacturing</b> has expanded in its depth and breadth of application, additional principles have been integrated into the method.|$|R

This non-recurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several [...] "spin-cycles" [...] to find errors in silicon, and encourages first-pass silicon success.

5000|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{is defined}} as a material joining process, whereby a product can be directly fabricated from its 3D model, usually layer upon layer. Comparing to traditional manufacturing technologies such as CNC machining or casting, AM processes have several unique capabilities. It enables the fabrication of parts with a complex shape as well as complex material distribution. These unique capabilities significantly enlarge the design freedom for designers. However, they also bring a big challenge. Traditional <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (DFM) rules or guidelines deeply rooted in designers’ mind and severely restrict designers to further improve product functional performance by taking advantages of these unique capabilities brought by AM processes. Moreover, traditional feature-based CAD tools are also difficult to deal with irregular geometry for the improvement of functional performance. To solve these issues, design methods or tools are needed to help designers to take full advantages of design freedom provide by AM processes.

5000|$|Valve {{went through}} several {{iterations}} for a controller {{that would be}} able to mimic keyboard and mouse controls, using prototypes made with 3D printing to test ergonomics. Early versions of the controller design included a trackball embedded in the controller to simulate mouse functionality, but opted eventually for trackpads to give more customization functionality to developers, such as the ability to simulate the motion of trackball by tracking a finger's motion on the trackpad. The trackpads and controller design were made to minimize the amount of contact that a player's thumbs would have on the trackpad when holding the unit. Unlike their current plans to have third-party hardware vendors manufacture Steam Machines, Valve plans to remain the sole manufacturer of the Steam Controller. Valve's Greg Coomer stated that this decision was based on achieving the best implementation of the Controller and Valve's vision for the device, noting that [...] "we didn’t think that it was really going to be possible to outsource the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and the finishing of the controller {{in a way that would}} allow third parties to take from us an idea or a reference design and bring it to market soon enough".
