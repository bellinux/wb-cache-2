5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} wave that formed Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic basin organized into Tropical Depression Twelve-E on September 15. It strengthened further into Tropical Storm Iselle the next day. The storm headed northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico, nearly strengthening into a hurricane late on September 17. While near its peak intensity, a trough abruptly recurved the system to the northeast. Wind shear also increased, and Iselle consequently fell apart on satellite imagery. It weakened to a depression on September 19. Iselle then <b>degenerated</b> into a remnant low {{the next day and}} rapidly <b>degenerated,</b> dissipating on September 20. Iselle never made landfall.|$|E

5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it <b>degenerated</b> into a tropical depression later that day.

During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph).

40|$|Abstract. An n-dimensional submanifold X of a {{projective}} space P N (C) is called tangentially <b>degenerate</b> if {{the rank of}} its Gauss mapping γ: X → G(n, N) satisfies 0 < rank γ < n. The authors systematically study the geometry of tangentially <b>degenerate</b> submanifolds of a {{projective space}} P N (C). By means of the focal images, three basic types of submanifolds are discovered: cones, tangentially <b>degenerate</b> hypersurfaces, and torsal submanifolds. Moreover, for tangentially <b>degenerate</b> submanifolds, a structural theorem is proven. By this theorem, tangentially <b>degenerate</b> submanifolds that {{do not belong to}} one the basic types are foliated into submanifolds of basic types. In the proof the authors introduce irreducible, reducible, and completely reducible tangentially <b>degenerate</b> submanifolds. It is found that cones and tangentially <b>degenerate</b> hypersurfaces are irreducible, and torsal submanifolds are completely reducible while all other tangentially <b>degenerate</b> submanifolds not belonging to basic types are reducible...|$|R

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it <b>degenerated</b> into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had developed over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to a depression again on July 2 over northeast Madhya Pradesh. It <b>degenerated</b> into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E

The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day.

All the <b>degenerate</b> problems origi-nate from the rank deficiency in the influence matrix. Both the Fredholm alternative theorem and singular value decomposition (SVD) technique are employed to study the <b>degenerate</b> problems. Updating terms and updating documents of the SVD technique are utilized. The roles of right and left unitary vectors of SVD in BEM and their relations to true, spurious and fictitious modes are examined by using the Fredholm alternative theorem. A unified method {{for dealing with the}} <b>degenerate</b> problem in BEM is proposed. Several examples are demonstrated to check the validity of the unified formulation...|$|R

5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and eventually, a hurricane.

5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had <b>degenerated</b> into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already <b>degenerated</b> into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E
