5|$|A new <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> of two-round voting {{had been}} {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b> For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} master’s thesis {{studies the}} mechanical effects of <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> on two <b>electoral</b> outcomes – proportionality and parliament fragmentation. The {{aim of the}} study is to investigate whether there is a precise universal relationship between proportionality and fragmentation across different <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> The thesis places itself into the general framework of new institutionalism, saying that institutions including <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> matter, but their precise effects depend on the context in which they operate. We propose that if context is taken into account and held under control while analysing pure mechanical effects of <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> a clear universal pattern emerges between proportionality and fragmentation. A computational experiment is carried out using constituency level data of 5 countries and 10 elections from the CLEA database. The results show a squared relationship between proportionality and parliament fragmentation, not a linear one that has been a tacit assumption in the debate between the proponents of majoritarian and proportional <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> Testing this squared relationship on broader data proves its validity, especially for PR <b>electoral</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between ethnic conflict, <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> and power sharing in ethnically divided societies.

The paper concludes that, while <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> are important, other factors like the power distribution between ethnic groups, and ensuring a non-zero-sum game may be as important...|$|R
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E
5|$|Under the Northwest Territories Act 1880 the {{district}} was mandated at its inception {{to return a}} single member to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the First Past the Post <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b> The district was named in the honour of former Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne. Lorne would tour the through the Northwest Territories just after the electoral district was created in 1881.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> elect {{a single}} winner to a unique position, such as prime minister, {{president}} or governor, while others elect multiple winners, such {{as members of}} parliament or boards of directors.

40|$|THESIS 10556 This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> on the way Members of Parliament (MPs) behave as measured {{both in terms of}} Parliamentary Party Group (PPG) unity and constituency links. The main argument is that <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> are likely to have a greater impact on MPs? behaviour in newly-democratised countries that have weak Party System Institutionalisation (PSI) than in established parhamentary democracies that have high levels of PSI. In weak PSI countries, I argue, <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> that allow intra-party competition are likely to lead to lower PPG unity and stronger constituency links, while <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> that lack intra-party competition are likely to lead to higher PPG unity and weaker constituency links...|$|R
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{was the son}} and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University {{he became one of}} the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> this gave them only 14 seats, but with the election having resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed the votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the {{reduction in the number of}} voters.|$|E
5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation {{provided for the}} tools {{that he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy of commodity prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic {{reform of the}} <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> and also some Tory ones, including protectionism. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he {{was introduced to the}} former Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of Sir Francis Sykes. She {{was having an affair with}} Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

40|$|In {{this review}} article, I {{identify}} the key {{questions raised by}} the treatment of <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> not as causal influences on party systems but as effects or byproducts of party systems. Framing these questions {{in the context of}} the classic consequences-oriented study of electoral institutions, I first review the classic approach, which treats <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> as causes, and explore the potential implications when <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> are viewed instead as outcomes of party systems. I then survey a variety of principal explanations of the origins and change of electoral laws, followed by a focus on several of the more explicitly defined models of this process. I conclude by discussing—and contesting—the notion that except for exceptional founding episodes of institutional choice, <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> eventually stabilize as equilibrium institutions...|$|R
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jean-Marie Le Pen {{announced}} in September 2008 {{that he would}} retire as FN president in 2010.

She sought to transform the FN into a mainstream party by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats up for election.|$|E

This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in the 1975 case Bolden v.

5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the death}} of the monarch {{required}} fresh elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most often, their tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{making a}} rapid recovery, the Belgian Workers' Party was still penalized by the Belgian <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> which based {{suffrage}} on wealth, stopping {{most of the}} party's support base among industrial workers from voting. In August 1885, the party began its Antwerp Programme, which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party's intention to pursue its goals through parliamentary democracy rather than revolution. The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike, involving some 250,000 workers. Fearing a revolution, the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894, but only with plural voting, which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens. Nevertheless, {{the percentage of the}} population eligible to vote rose from 3.9 to 37.3 percent, and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats. The Belgian Workers' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end the plural voting system.|$|E
