40|$|A case {{of arsenic}} {{contamination}} {{has recently been}} detected in the Lami coastal environment {{during the course of}} a heavy metal monitoring in Fiji’s coastal environment. Twenty two surficial sediment samples were sampled during the 2008 - 2009 period, extracted for arsenic and analysed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Two sites within the Lami estuary recorded the highest As levels of 334 and 282 mg kg- 1 as dry weight in sediments samples, which has greatly exceeded the local and global average background concentrations. Chemical fractionation studies using a standard sequential protocol showed that As is mostly associated with residual (strong acid extractable) phase of the sediments, however significant amounts of As were also detected in bioavailable (exchangeable, water and acid soluble), reducible and oxidisable fractions. Comparison with standard sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) indicate that As levels are likely to be highly toxic to biota, hence <b>further</b> <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies</b> are warranted to evaluate possible environmental effects on the aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{distinguish}} the impacts of two different anthropogenic conditions using the honeybee Apis mellifera as a bioindicator associatedwith a battery of biomarkers previously validated in the laboratory. Both the urban (RAV, Ravine des Cabris) and semi-natural (CIL, Cilaos) sites in La Reunion Islandwere compared in order to assess the impacts of two types of local pollution using the discriminating potential of biomarkers. Hives were placed at the CIL and RAV sites and honeybees were collected from each hive every three months over one year. Honeybee responses were evaluated with respect to several biochemical biomarkers: glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and metallothioneins (MT). The results showed a significant difference between the localities in terms of GST, AChE and ALP activities, as regarding midgut MT tissue levels. Compared to the CIL site, ALP and MT tissue levels were higher at the RAV site, although AChE activity was lower. GST displayed more contrasted effects. These results strongly suggest that the honeybees based in the more anthropized area were subjected to sublethal stress involving both oxidative stress and detoxification processes with the occurrence of neurotoxic pollutants, amongst which metals were good candidates. A classification tree enabled defining a decision procedure to distinguish the sampling locations and enabled excellent classification accuracy (89 %) for the data set. This field study constitutes a strong support in favour of the in situ assessment of environmental quality using honeybee biomarkers and validates the possibility of performing <b>further</b> <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies</b> using honeybee biomarkers.

40|$|International audienceRemote sub-Antarctic {{islands and}} their {{wildlife}} may be contaminated by mercury via atmospheric and oceanic currents. Because of mercury's high toxicity and {{its capacity to}} be biomagnified in marine food chains, top predators like seabirds may be threatened by secondary poisoning. The present study provides data regarding mercury concentrations in breast feathers sampled in 2000 and 2001 on king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) living at Crozet Islands. These contemporary concentrations were compared to those measured in feathers of king penguins sampled in the same colony between 1966 and 1974 and preserved in a museum (1970 s sample). The average concentration of the contemporary sample is 1. 98 microg g(- 1) (dry mass) and is significantly different than the concentrations reported in some other penguin species. The concentration of the contemporary sample is {{significantly lower than the}} concentration of the 1970 s sample (2. 66 microg g(- 1)). This suggests that mercury concentrations in southern hemisphere seabirds do not increase, which conflicts with the trends observed in the northern hemisphere. This difference in temporal trends between the northern and southern hemispheres usually is attributed mainly to a higher degree of pollutant emission in the northern hemisphere. Parameters that may explain the interspecies differences in mercury concentrations are discussed. These first results may constitute a basis for <b>further</b> <b>ecotoxicological</b> and/or biomonitoring <b>studies</b> of king penguins in these remote ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory {{policies}} {{in many parts}} of the world recognize either the utility of or the mandate that all available studies be considered in environmental or ecological hazard and risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals, including studies from the peer-reviewed literature. Consequently, a vast array of different studies and data types need to be considered. The first steps in the evaluation process involve determining whether the study is relevant to the ERA and sufficiently reliable. Relevance evaluation is typically performed using existing guidance but involves application of "expert judgment" by risk assessors. In the present paper, we review published guidance for relevance evaluation and, on the basis of the practical experience within the group of authors, we identify additional aspects and further develop already proposed aspects that should be considered when conducting a relevance assessment for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies.</b> From a regulatory point of view, the overarching key aspect of relevance concerns the ability to directly or indirectly use the study in ERA with the purpose of addressing specific protection goals and ultimately regulatory decision making. Because ERA schemes are based on the appropriate linking of exposure and effect estimates, important features of <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies</b> relate to exposure relevance and biological relevance. Exposure relevance addresses the representativeness of the test substance, environmental exposure media, and exposure regime. Biological relevance deals with the environmental significance of the test organism and the endpoints selected, the ecological realism of the test conditions simulated in the study, as well as a mechanistic link of treatment-related effects for endpoints to the protection goal identified in the ERA. In addition, uncertainties associated with relevance should be considered in the assessment. A systematic and transparent assessment of relevance is needed for regulatory decision making.

Using gel-free proteomic analysis, we have identified 45 proteins, of which 25 were significantly differently expressed according to sex and/or BDE- 47 exposure. These proteins were involved in several biological processes such as energy metabolism, chaperone proteins, or transcription/translation. In unexposed amphipods, 11 proteins were significantly over-expressed in females, and 6 proteins were over-expressed in males. Under BDE- 47 stress, 7 proteins were differently impacted according to sex.

South Africa {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} mining countries in the world, hosting the world's largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs). Even though mining is clearly an important activity in South Africa, contributing approximately US$ 7. 4 billion annually to the countries' gross domestic product (GDP), the costs to the environment are not insignificant. One of the most severe environmental aspects associated with mining is the storage of mineral waste on tailings storage facilities due to their impacts on air quality, ground water quality, aesthetics and land use. It is also unknown whether the environmental effects of tailings storage facilities increase or decrease over time. The aim of this study was to determine the ecotoxicity of platinum tailings storage facilities of different ages by means of soil physical and chemical analysis, earthworm <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies,</b> dehydrogenase activity and soil mesofauna studies. Samples were obtained from three platinum tailings storage facilities of different ages of which two were already rehabilitated while the third was still operational at the time this study was performed. The latter was used as a negative control for the purpose of the study. Soil samples were physically and chemically analysed. Earthworm <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted to determine changes in biomass, reproduction, mortality, neutral red retention times and tissue metal concentrations. Dehydrogenase activity was determined before the introduction of earthworms and manure, after introductions of manure and after introductions of earthworms and manure. Soil mesofauna were extracted and identified in order to determine species richness, diversity, abundance and functional grouping. Soil chemical analysis indicated that concentrations of certain heavy metals, especially chrome (Cr), present in platinum tailings materials could have a potential effect on microorganisms, microbial processes and earthworms. Earthworm ecotoxicological results indicated that earthworms that bioaccumulated higher levels of heavy metals showed poor hatchability of cocoons. Dehydrogenase activity indicated that earthworms play a significant role in increasing the number and biomass of soil microbes because significant increases in dehydrogenase activity were noticed after the addition of earthworms to platinum tailings materials. Results from the earthworm <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies,</b> dehydrogenase activity, and soil mesofauna composition indicated that environmental impacts of tailings storage facilities did not increase with age, but is more likely to be an indication of the rehabilitation measures administered to the different tailings storage facilities.

Despite the importance, not enough information is available in the literature pertaining to the determination of oxidative damage to DNA in wild species. Among the aquatic organisms, bivalve molluscs and fish species have been widely used for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>studies</b> and for the determination of DNA strand breaks using the standard comet assay. For these organisms, the widely used cell types are haemocytes for molluscs and erythrocytes for fish, although other cell types (e. g. gill cells) are also used.

We have used these cell types from fish and bivalve species and have determined the oxidative damage to DNA following exposure to a range of environmental stressors (e. g. metals, nanoparticles and hypoxia). Overall these studies suggest that while in vitro optimisation studies using hydrogen peroxide provide a concentration-dependent response, the results do not always mirror the in vitro response in in vivo situations.
