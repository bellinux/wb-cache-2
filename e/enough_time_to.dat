5|$|Although {{the band}} {{did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release. Five {{thousand}} copies was the label's average. Show No Mercy went on to sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.|$|E
5|$|Kaepernick {{took over}} on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01and made four {{completions}} {{to drive to the}} Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> run out the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E

Shot and killed during the attack, Librescu was posthumously awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, the country's highest civilian honor. Coincidentally, Librescu's act of heroism happened on the 27th of Nisan on the Jewish lunar calendar. That date is Yom HaShoah which is Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service.

5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E

5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at its own}} 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three {{straight}} running plays {{in an effort to}} run the clock down and prevent Boston College from having <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> conduct another offensive drive.

5|$|The {{coronation}} {{usually takes}} place {{several months after}} the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E

5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E

Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers.

Afterward, Lariboisière was sent to northern Italy where he commanded the advance guard division; Jean Victor Moreau's right wing, with Lariboisière's infantry and artillery, crossed the Ticino river at Pavia, marched up the left bank of the Po River and took position beneath Alessandria; there, he protected Moreau's flank from Russian skirmishers sufficiently for Moreau to establish a large train of artillery in Turin and to strengthen the French positions between the Po and the Tanaro river.|$|E
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
