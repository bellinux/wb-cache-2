5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of <b>incomplete</b> <b>data</b> it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 As {{datasets}} become {{larger and}} larger, {{there is a}} need for algorithms that can efficiently extract the relevant information for a given task and represent it in a concise manner. Supervised dimensionality reduction is one approach to doing this, as it reduces the input space of the data while retaining the characteristics of the data that are useful for classification. This dissertation motivates and analyzes a new supervised dimensionality reduction technique called local discriminative Gaussian (LDG) dimensionality reduction. Experiments show that LDG is fast and effective when compared to other state-of-the-art supervised linear dimensionality reduction methods. LDG is shown to also be effective in the small sample size problem, where few training examples are provided in relation to the input dimensionality of the data. LDG is then extended to the transfer learning problem, where the goal is to classify test examples drawn from a target domain distribution using training examples drawn from a source domain distribution that differs from the target domain. Another contribution of this dissertation is an algorithm that reliably classifies <b>incomplete</b> test <b>data.</b> <b>Incomplete</b> test <b>data</b> classification is useful if one wishes to classify a test sample before all of the test data is gathered, for example, if one wishes to make an early decision on time-series data. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can classify <b>incomplete</b> time-series <b>data</b> while maintaining accuracy that is comparable to that achieved using the complete test data. Furthermore, LDG dimensionality reduction is shown to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the <b>incomplete</b> test <b>data</b> classifier...|$|R

25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to <b>incomplete</b> <b>data</b> on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} that {{high doses of}} X-ray radiation can cause cancer, leukemia, or other genetic diseases [1 – 3]. To reduce the damage of X-ray to the human body, {{it is necessary to}} study the low-dose CT imaging problem without sacrificing the clinical diagnosis information. Low-dose medical CT imaging is to reconstruct CT image by <b>incomplete</b> projection <b>data</b> or coarse data. However, some reconstruction methods based on the Nyquist sampling theorem restrict low-dose medical CT reconstruction by <b>incomplete</b> projection <b>data.</b> Moreover, in the process of CT image formation, it is often affected by the point spread function of the system. This will result in image degradation and artifacts. In addition, when the image is reconstructed from <b>incomplete</b> projection <b>data,</b> the influence of noise will be more serious. Therefore, it is of great significance to study how to eliminate the effects of the point spread function and realize the accurate low-dose medical CT reconstruction.|$|R

Finally, probabilistic structure is learned through dependency analysis from the completed data set.
