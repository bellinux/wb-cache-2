We used a dynamic state variable model to find energy allocation strategies to length, fat, and ovaries that maximize expected egg production of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).

A theoretical reciprocal transplant explored how latitude-specific optimal strategies affected growth at other latitudes. At low ration, allocation and growth were similar among latitudes, with length selected in small individuals and reproductive tissue and fat in large counterparts. At high rations, low-latitude fish invested most energy to length and reproduction; high-latitude fish allocated to length during summer and fat during fall and developed ovaries {{earlier in the}} year.

40|$|Coral reefs {{support an}} {{abundance}} of organisms despite being surrounded by oceanic waters characterized by low nutrient levels. Over {{more than a century}} of research, scientists have debated whether life on coral reefs is self-sustaining or whether reef organisms extract nutrients from the open ocean that in turn subsidize organic production within the reef system. This dissertation focuses on one guild of coral reef consumers - fish that feed on zooplankton from the water column. Pairing two independent metrics of fish diet - gut content analysis and stable isotope analysis followed by a mass- balance mixing model - I provide direct evidence that zooplankton from the open ocean comprise a significant proportion of the diet of fish inhabiting both offshore and nearshore reefs. In a study of feeding behavior of the planktivorous fish Dascyllus flavicaudus, I document that this species feeds selectively on certain taxa within the zooplankton assemblage. Oceanic copepods (Oncaeidae and Corycaeidae) were over-represented in fish gut contents relative to their abundance in environmental zooplankton samples. Non-random feeding by D. flavicaudus resulted in a 2 to 6 -fold increase in the contribution of oceanic prey to fish diet beyond that expected under random feeding. The natural spatial variability in the zooplankton assemblage on coral reefs has the potential to affect not only fish diet but fish growth. I examined the relationship between zooplankton abundance, fish feeding and fish growth using a field experiment where juvenile <b>fish</b> were <b>transplanted</b> to reef habitats spanning a range of ambient zooplankton densities. The resulting spatial patterns in fish growth support the hypothesis that spatial variability in the abundance of zooplankton prey can significantly affect <b>fish</b> growth. <b>Fish</b> <b>transplanted</b> to locations with turbid waters exhibited low growth rates, suggesting that changes in land use practices which alter water quality may have deleterious effects on planktivorous reef fishes and that factors such as turbidity can act to de-couple fish growth from zooplankton abundance.

40|$|Ecosystems are {{intricately}} {{linked by}} {{the flow of}} organisms across their boundaries, and such connectivity can be essential to the structure and function of the linked ecosystems. For example, many coral reef fish populations are maintained by the movement of individuals from spatially segregated juvenile habitats (i. e., nurseries, such as mangroves and seagrass beds) to areas preferred by adults. It is presumed that nursery habitats provide for faster growth (higher food availability) and/or low predation risk for juveniles, but empirical data supporting this hypothesis is surprisingly lacking for coral reef fishes. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms (growth, predation risk, and reproductive investment) {{that give rise to}} the distribution patterns of a common Caribbean reef fish species, Haemulon flavolineatum (French grunt). Adults were primarily found on coral reefs, whereas juvenile fish only occurred in non-reef habitats. Contrary to our initial expectations, analysis of length-at-age revealed that growth rates were highest on coral reefs and not within nursery habitats. Survival rates in tethering trials were 0 % for small juvenile <b>fish</b> <b>transplanted</b> to coral reefs and 24 – 47 % in the nurseries. As fish grew, survival rates on coral reefs approached those in non-reef habitats (56 vs. 77 – 100 %, respectively). As such, predation seems to be the primary factor driving across-ecosystem distributions of this fish, and thus the primary reason why mangrove and seagrass habitats function as nursery habitat. Identifying the mechanisms that lead to such distributions is critical to develop appropriate conservation initiatives, identify essential fish habitat, and predict impacts associated with environmental change.

30|$|Archaeologists {{have been}} slower {{to embrace the}} idea of marine {{resource}} management on the Northwest Coast, and in particular that management systems {{played a role in}} ensuring ongoing access and availability of resources. In the case of salmon, for instance, many recognize the combined importance of mass capture and storage technologies but emphasize the role that social networks had on dampening spatial and temporal resource variability (Schalk 1977; Suttles 1987). In the case of shellfish, Croes and Hackenberger (1988, 1989) posit that overexploitation {{led to the development of}} harvest controls, but they do not recognize the possibility of enhancement strategies. The lack of recognition of the breadth of management strategies is in part due to the fact that the archaeological record, because it is largely an amalgamation of certain kinds of events, does not often provide evidence of the subtle management practices that may mimic natural processes (e.g., <b>transplanting</b> <b>fish</b> eggs) or that are conducted by individuals (Lepofsky and Kahn 2011).|$|R
40|$|The Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), Thunnus macoyii, is {{a highly}} sought after fish in the Japanese and {{international}} market and as such, it is garnering great interest in the aquaculture sector, in attempts to farm the SBT in aquaculture facilities. However, SBT reaches sexual maturity {{at the age of}} 10 - 12 years, weighing approximately 100 - 150 kg, which implies heavy husbandry and maintenance costs and labour. Further to this, SBT broodstock cannot be handled for reproductive assessment, and the spawning season in captivity is short, thus limiting work on larval rearing and juvenile stages. Therefore, in order to secure a steady supply of SBT seed, both for R&D and commercial applications, improvement in SBT reproductive performance is needed. One of the most important recent discoveries that may revolutionize SBT aquaculture has been the development of surrogate broodstock technology, pioneered by Professor Gore Yoshizaki and his research group (Yoshizaki et al., 2003). Surrogate technology is already used across the medical and agricultural disciplines, when embryos from high value cows or mares are implanted in less valuable surrogates. Fish however, encorporates a flexible and conserved gonads development mechanism, allowing successful transplantation of primordial germ and Spermatogonia A cells into larvae of a different species and even families of <b>fish.</b> The <b>transplanted</b> cells then join the native germ cells’ migration routes to the genital ridge and can differentiate into a functioning donor derived gonad. Transplanting SBT germ cells in a small and fast growing host such as Yellowtail Kingfish (YTK), Mactuna, Skipjack tuna, etc. and obtaining a surrogate which develops gonads with SBT eggs and sperm, will transform broodstock management by reducing dramatically the cost of facilities, enabling year round SBT seed production and opening the door {{for the development of a}} genetic selection program for SBT, as it effectively cuts the generation time to 2 - 3 years...|$|R

Upon <b>transplanting</b> the <b>fish</b> from fresh water into sea water fish it was Vibrio. Upon <b>transplanting</b> the <b>fish</b> from fresh water into sea water, Aeromonas of the terrestrial type was gradually replaced by Pseudomonas as the proportion of sea water in the rearing water increased.

The siganids strongly selected Sargassum sp. (Phaeophyta) and, to a lesser extent, Hypnea sp. (Rhodophyta), but strongly avoided calcified macroalgae. However, S. doliatus displayed strong selection for Hypnea sp., whereas S. canaliculatus exhibited stronger selection for Sargassum sp. In contrast, the parrotfishes exhibited similar selectivities, with all 3 species selecting heavily calcified Halimeda spp. (Chlorophyta), but strongly avoiding Galaxaura sp.

40|$|Speciation can be {{promoted}} by phenotypic plasticity if plasticity causes populations in ecologically different habitats to diverge in traits mediating reproductive isolation. Although this pathway can establish reproductive barriers immediately and without genetic divergence, it remains poorly investigated. In threespine stickleback fish, divergence in body size between populations represents a potent source of reproductive isolation because body size often influences reproductive behavior. However, the relative contribution of phenotypic plasticity and genetically based divergence to stickleback body size evolution {{has not been}} explored. We here do so by using populations residing contiguously in Lake Constance (Central Europe) and its tributaries, a system where lake fish exhibit strikingly larger size and greater age at maturity than stream fish. Laboratory experiments reveal the absence of substantial genetic divergence in intrinsic growth rates and maturation size thresholds between lake and stream <b>fish.</b> A field <b>transplant</b> experiment further demonstrates that lake fish display the life history typical of stream fish when exposed to stream habitats for one year, confirming that life history divergence in this system is mainly plastic.

Phenotypic variation among populations may indicate local shifts in this balance, or that different stable ‘solutions’ are possible, but testing these alternatives presents a major challenge. In the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a small freshwater fish with male-limited ornamental coloration, these issues can be addressed by <b>transplanting</b> <b>fish</b> among sites of varying predation pressure, thus effectively manipulating the strength and nature of natural selection. Here, we contrast the evolutionary outcome of two such introductions conducted in the Trinidadian El Cedro and Aripo Rivers. We use sophisticated colour appraisal methods that account for full spectrum colour variation and which incorporate the very latest visual sensitivity data for guppies and their predators. Our data indicate that ornamentation evolved along different trajectories: whereas Aripo males evolved more numerous and/or larger orange, black and iridescent markings, El Cedro males only evolved more extensive and brighter iridescence. Examination of the El Cedro experiment also revealed little or no ornamental evolution at the control site over 29 years, which contrasts markedly with the rapid (approx. 2 – 3 years) changes reported for introduction populations. Finally, whole colour-pattern analysis suggested that the greatest visual difference between El Cedro introduction and control fish would be perceived by the two most salient viewers: guppies and the putatively dangerous predator Crenicichla alta.

40|$|AbstractThe Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus {{has many}} of the {{favorable}} attributes that have made the zebrafish a model system in developmental biology. The existence of eyed surface (surface fish) and blind cave (cavefish) dwelling forms in Astyanax also provides an attractive system for studying the evolution of developmental mechanisms. The polarity of evolutionary changes and the environmental conditions leading to the cavefish phenotype are known with certainty, and several different cavefish populations have evolved constructive and regressive changes independently. The constructive changes include enhancement of the feeding apparatus (jaws, taste buds, and teeth) and the mechanosensory system of cranial neuromasts. The homeobox gene Prox 1, which is expressed in the expanded taste buds and cranial neuromasts, {{is one of the}} genes involved in the constructive changes in sensory organ development. The regressive changes include loss of pigmentation and eye degeneration. Although adult cavefish lack functional eyes, small eye primordia are formed during embryogenesis, which later arrest in development, degenerate, and sink into the orbit. Apoptosis and lens signaling to other eye parts, such as the cornea, iris, and retina, result in the arrest of eye development and ultimate optic degeneration. Accordingly, an eye with restored cornea, iris, and retinal photoreceptor cells is formed when a surface <b>fish</b> lens is <b>transplanted</b> into a cavefish optic cup, indicating that cavefish optic tissues have conserved the ability to respond to lens signaling. Genetic analysis indicates that multiple genes regulate eye degeneration, and molecular studies suggest that Pax 6 {{may be one of the}} genes controlling cavefish eye degeneration.

ANOVA analyses of the tagging periods identified season as the only significant predictor of home range size, with a general increase in home range from pre-winter to post-winter seasons, and no effect of fish capture or release location. Mean seasonal home range areas during both tagging periods exceed those documented for age 2 - 3 Atlantic cod in other studies, suggesting a less established residency in age 1 Greenland cod. High individuality in movement patterns and area usage indicate that factors affecting dispersal, such as temperature, predation, and age, likely differ in importance across individuals in the age class...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons are {{powerful}} tools for {{making sense of}} worlds. But comparisons do not merely identify inherent or pre-existing similarities and differences; instead, they participate in making the very worlds they aim to describe. This dissertation probes how comparative practices shape the formation of multispecies landscapes. I show that the specificities of how people make comparisons {{and what kinds of}} comparisons they make are a powerful but often overlooked part of the production of human-nonhuman arrangements, as well as knowledges about them. By focusing on salmon in Hokkaido, Japan, I demonstrate that neither the island's watershed ecologies nor its fish population structures can be understood without attention to practices of comparison-making. Since the mid- 19 th century, natural resources management in northern Japan has been profoundly shaped by how people both within and beyond Japan have compared Hokkaido's landscapes and fish to those {{in other parts of the}} world. After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japanese officials sought to "develop" Hokkaido's lands and waters and make them legibly "modern" to Euro-American audiences. They did so by importing "Western" crops and livestock, promoting large-scale commercial agriculture, and constructing salmon hatcheries. Since that time, the ways that Japanese fishermen, scientists, government officials, and indigenous peoples have compared Hokkaido's salmon and salmon-bearing watersheds to others around the globe have dramatically affected the region's approaches to fisheries management, as well as its salmon. Drawing on ethnographic, archival, and fisheries science research in Hokkaido, the U. S. Pacific Northwest, and Chile, my dissertation demonstrates how particular practices of comparison have created cross-border movements - such as transplants of salmon eggs, exchanges of currency, transfers of scientific technology, and exports of processed fish products - that have shaped the course of Hokkaido's development, the genes of its fish, and the identities of its people. Comparison, I show, is not just a "meta" act of analysis, but also an everyday practice that alters both human and nonhuman bodies and relations. When a Japanese consumer compares kinds of salmon at a supermarket and decides to purchase the fish labeled "wild," or when a Chilean biologist compares the temperature of a Patagonian river to one in Hokkaido, determining that it might be possible to <b>transplant</b> <b>fish</b> from one side of the Pacific to the other, such decisions fundamentally reconfigure human and salmon lives. By tracing such far-reaching comparisons, this dissertation attempts to open up the practices and geographies through which we know landscapes...|$|R
