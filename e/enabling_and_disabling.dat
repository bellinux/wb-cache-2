2500|$|The {{researchers}} at Carnegie Mellon University have developed various prototypes of catoms. [...] These vary from small cubes to giant helium balloons. The prototype {{that is most}} like what developers hope catoms will become is the planar catom. [...] These {{take the form of}} 44mm diameter cylinders. [...] These cylinders are equipped with 24 electromagnets arranged in a series of stacked rings along the cylinder’s circumference. [...] Movement is achieved by the catoms cooperatively <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> the magnets in order to roll along each other’s surfaces. [...] Only one magnet on each catom is energized at a time. [...] These prototypes are able to reconfigure themselves quite quickly, with the uncoupling of two units, movement to another contact point, and recoupling taking only about 100 ms. [...] Power is supplied to the catoms using pickup feet {{on the bottom of the}} cylinder. [...] Conductive strips on the table supply the necessary power.|$|E

5000|$|Such a system, with an [...] {{command to}} send {{documents}} to the queue, was first introduced in 1973 in Version 4 of Unix. By the release of System V Release 4, the suite of utilities had grown to include commands for canceling print jobs, moving jobs among queues, <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> queues, <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> a job scheduler daemon, and status reports of the print system. The [...] command handled queue documents to be printed and had over 20 different options that controlled {{the appearance of the}} document and its place in the queue, and even handled email notification of the user once the document had finished printing. The command returned a [...] "job id" [...] which could be used by the cancel or lpstat commands to remove the job from the queue or check on its progress, respectively. While the system was considered to be quite complex to set up and administer, most uses were expected to only use these three commands.|$|E
50|$|In {{implicit}} mode, {{the entire}} FTPS session is encrypted. Explicit mode differs {{in that the}} client has full control over what areas of the connection are to be encrypted. <b>Enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> of encryption for the FTPS control channel and FTPS data channel can occur at any time. The only restriction comes from the FTPS server, which {{has the ability to}} deny commands based on server encryption policy.|$|E
30|$|According to the IEEE 802.11, {{there are}} two types of {{communication}} modes in wireless networks, namely, the <b>enabled</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabled</b> RTS/CTS handshakes. Since the proposed models directly deal with the wireless CP, enabling or disabling the handshake can provide significant differences in the network performance. This motivates us to perform the experiments under two general scenarios as <b>enabled</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabled</b> handshakes. Each of these scenarios includes two more sub-scenarios to evaluate the models performance under DoS attacks and under normal conditions without any attacks.|$|R

5000|$|Compared to its predecessor, the 380EX, it {{provided}} slightly more power, an improved autofocus assist beam, tilt and swivel (the 380EX could only tilt), {{and the ability}} to serve as a slave in Canon's wireless multiple-flash system. [...] Like the 380EX, the 420EX did not provide user controls (other than <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> high-speed sync); any flash-related settings, such as exposure compensation or second-curtain synchronization, had to be set using the body.|$|E

5000|$|Package Control is a {{third-party}} package manager for Sublime Text {{which allows the}} user to find, install, upgrade and remove plug-ins, usually without restarting Sublime Text. The package manager keeps installed packages up-to-date with an auto-upgrade feature and downloads packages from GitHub, BitBucket and a custom JSON-encoded channel/repository system. It also handles updating packages cloned from GitHub and BitBucket via Git and Hg, {{as well as providing}} commands for <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> packages. The package manager also includes a command to bundle any package directory into a [...]sublime-package file.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} networking, Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is a Network Control Protocol (NCP) {{for establishing}} and configuring Internet Protocol over a Point-to-Point Protocol link. IPCP {{is responsible for}} configuring the IP addresses {{as well as for}} <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> the IP protocol modules on both ends of the point-to-point link. IPCP uses the same packet exchange mechanism as the Link Control Protocol. IPCP packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-Layer Protocol phase, and any IPCP packets received before this phase is reached should be silently discarded. IPCP has the NCP protocol code number 0x8021.|$|E

50|$|The MS-DOS version, {{developed}} by Eurocom {{and published by}} GameTek, was released in May 1995 in North America and Europe. There are secret commands to use each character's original color scheme, as well as attacks that {{were removed from the}} 3DO version due to memory constraints. The option menus have custom settings (such as <b>enabling</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabling</b> parallax scrolling) that allows the game to be played with low hardware specifications. The biggest change is the game's resolution; the game is played with a resolution of 320x200 on AT/PC-compatible machines and, since the graphic data is ported straight from the arcade version, all of the characters appear large due to the narrow screen size. Because of this, the distance between both fighters {{at the beginning of a}} match is slightly narrower than in the arcade version. There were many glitches in the initial shipments of the DOS port, such as characters landing and recovering normally after landing from a jump if they're knocked out in mid-air with a basic attack. A patch file was distributed that corrected these glitches, which were later fixed in version 1.5 of the retail release. A patch file for version 1.6 was released as well. The music has been remixed as well, although the arrangements are different from the ones used in the 3DO soundtrack.|$|E
