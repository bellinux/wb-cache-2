500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would love to hate <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems {{to take over a}} picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E

He has often stated that the lack of musical Academy training was of course a disadvantage, but this was compensated by the advantage of being an actor who composes for fellow-actors and senses their need on the stage or on the screen: [...] "After all, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> right professors and they were good in a certain art (which was my case) they could teach you the rules of arts in a way to use them in another field of your muses. Because the rules of art are universal. For me there’s no difference if I play a character, compose music or write poetry for my songs, it’s all about telling stories, communication, sharing thoughts and emotions, about the ability to stretch and push the boundaries with visions of your own world".|$|E
