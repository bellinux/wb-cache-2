Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} social monitoring and <b>feeding</b> competition on foraging success {{in relation to the}} <b>feeding</b> group size of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Social monitoring is visual scanning by group members that assists them in following their own group. Individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups may frequently use social monitoring while foraging, because they have an increased risk of losing their group. Therefore, social monitoring could be a cost for group-foraging animals. We made four predictions: (1) individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups tend to abandon food patches to follow group members; (2) social monitoring frequency is higher in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups; (3) <b>feeding</b> rate decreases with increased social monitoring frequency; and (4) <b>feeding</b> rate initially increases with <b>feeding</b> group size because decreased social monitoring outweighs increased <b>feeding</b> competition, but after the <b>feeding</b> group reaches a certain size, <b>feeding</b> rate declines with increasing <b>feeding</b> group size due to the high costs of <b>feeding</b> competition. These predictions were supported by our results. Thus, the relationship between <b>feeding</b> group size and <b>feeding</b> rate can show three patterns (positive, neutral and negative) in response to the balance between the costs of social monitoring and <b>feeding</b> competition...|$|R

A significant effect of higher <b>feeding</b> rate using lower <b>feeding</b> frequency on growth was manifested in final mean weight and SGR; increasing <b>feeding</b> rate resulted in increased growth. <b>Feeding</b> frequency significantly influenced fry survival with highest values observed when fry were fed once or three times per day.

Subjects: Television programmes and newspaper articles that made reference to infant <b>feeding</b> during March 1999. Setting: UK mass media.

40|$|Breast <b>feeding</b> {{promotion}} {{has been}} a national priority in Jamaica since the mid- 1970 s. Despite this effort, breast <b>feeding</b> rates have continued to decline there, especially in urban areas.

In the context of declining breast <b>feeding</b> in a nation committed to promoting it, the goal {{of this study was to}} explore the relationship between specific health professional practices, mothers' breast <b>feeding,</b> and mothers' knowledge of breast <b>feeding</b> in rural and urban Jamaica. To accomplish this goal, a structured interview was administered to 113 mothers of infants age 0 - 6 months at one urban (n= 62) and one rural (n= 51) hospital, regarding (1) physician and nurse practices known to affect breast <b>feeding,</b> (2) mothers' own breast <b>feeding</b> practices, and (3) mothers knowledge of breast <b>feeding</b> issues. Physician and nurse visits were also directly observed to confirm responses given to the questionnaire and to assess the resources devoted to teaching mothers about breast <b>feeding.</b> While extensive lectures, posters and pamphlets promoting breast <b>feeding</b> were provided for mothers at the urban hospital, far fewer educational resources were available for mothers at the rural hospital. Overall, however, health professional practices discouraging breast <b>feeding</b> were observed more frequently at the urban hospital than at the rural hospital, whereas practices promoting breast <b>feeding</b> were more common at the rural hospital. At the rural hospital, mothers' breast <b>feeding</b> practices more closely approximated recommendations than at the urban hospital. Moreover, there was no difference between urban and rural mothers' knowledge about breast <b>feeding,</b> despite the input of far greater educational resources to mothers at the urban hospital. This study suggests that merely educating mothers about breast <b>feeding</b> is insufficient.
