5|$|If the Bismarck {{has been}} intercepted or {{compromised}} by Royal Navy ships, {{the game will}} automatically shift to an arcade sequence which will give the player an opportunity to defend the ship against a British attack, or alternatively, if playing as the British, the sequence is utilised in order to destroy the Bismarck. The feature can be displayed at any time, though it is automatically enabled if either side comes into conflict. The interface of the feature is split into three sections; {{the upper part of}} the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity. The middle section contains buttons and icons which are used to control ship movement and to fire weapons. The lower part of the screen displays a <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> the ship from the side chosen (Bismarck or Royal Navy ships); the diagram will change colours once the ship receives damage from shelling.|$|E

2500|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the word}} to [...] "genetics" [...] has generated many parallel usages. The [...] "epigenome" [...] is a parallel to the word [...] "genome", referring to the overall epigenetic state of a cell, and epigenomics refers to more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome. The phrase [...] "genetic code" [...] has also been adaptedâ€”the [...] "epigenetic code" [...] {{has been used to}} describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the [...] "epigenetic code" [...] could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an epigenomic map, a <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the histone code or DNA methylation patterns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a two-dimensional graphical representation {{for the space}} of intervals and interval relations.

Also, a set of new graphical symbols for the interval relations is proposed.

60|$|Section 6. The coelom, or body cavity, of Amphioxus lies, of course, {{as in the}} vertebrata, {{between the}} {{intestinal}} wall and the body walls, and, {{just as in the}} vertebrata, it is largely reduced where gill slits occur. But matters are rather complicated by the presence of an atrial cavity round the pharynx, which is not certainly represented in the vertebrata, and which the student is at first apt to call the body cavity, although it is entirely distinct and different from that space. The mutual relation of the two will become apparent after a study of Figures 10, 11, 12 (Sheet 21). Figure 10 gives diagrammatically a section of a very young stage of Amphioxus; P is the pharynx portion of the alimentary canal, coe. is the coelom surrounding it at this stage here as elsewhere; mt.c. are certain lymph spaces, the metapleural canals, between which a small invagination (i.e., a pushing-in), at., of the outer epidermis occurs; n.c. is the notochord, and s.c. the spinal cord. The gill slits, by which P. communicates with the exterior, are not shown. Next Figure 11 shows the invagination (at.) pushing its way in, and cut off from the exterior by a meeting of the body wall below. Note that at. is a portion of the animal's exterior thus embraced by its body, and that its lining is therefore of the same material as the external integument. In Figure 12, at. is developing upward, so that the true body hangs into it. Now imagine the gill slits perforated, as shown by the double-headed arrow in Figure 12. Figure 3, on Sheet 20, is a less <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> a cross-section of the pharyngeal region (vide Figure 1, Sheet 19). The student should compare Figure 3, Sheet 20, and Figure 12, Sheet 21. The atrium and metapleural canals are easily recognised in both. In Figure 3 the coelom is much cut up by the gill slits, and we have remaining of it (a) the dorsal coelomic canals (d.c.c.) and (b) the branchial canals (br.c.) in the bars between the slits. The atrial cavity remains open to the exterior at one point, the atrial pore (at.p.).|$|E

40|$|The `swirling' {{seen when}} platelet-rich plasma is stirred {{is caused by}} the average {{asymmetry}} of the platelets and a technique for recording the swirling is reported. After the addition of adenosine diphosphate, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, thrombin, and collagen, platelets become rounded and more symmetrical immediately before they become sticky. Monoiodo-acetate and adenosine prevent both the change in shape and sticking whereas E. D. T. A. and p-tosyl arginine methylester prevent sticking but the shape still changes. Adrenaline produces sticking but no change in shape. The effects of temperature and E. D. T. A. are also reported.

The domain of systems analysis and design was used to generate examples and test the theory. A cognitive model of diagram integration was proposed, and an experimental study was conducted to explore the effects of representational features of diagrams on the cognitive process of diagram integration. Results of the experiment show that the representational features of the diagrams acted as the criteria for selecting among various methods for analyzing and designing the integrated diagram. In addition, the difference in the selected methods resulted in different task performances in terms of ana [...] ...|$|R
