50|$|<b>Enprostil</b> is a {{synthetic}} prostaglandin designed to resemble dinoprostone. <b>Enprostil</b> {{was found to}} be a highly potent inhibitor of gastric HCl secretion. It is an analog of prostaglandin E2 but unlike this prostaglandin, which binds to and activates all four cellular receptors viz., EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors, <b>enprostil</b> is a more selective receptor agonist in that it binds to and activates primarily the EP3 receptor. Consequently, <b>enprostil</b> is expected to have a narrower range of actions that may avoid some of the unwanted side-effects and toxicities of prostaglandin E2. A prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in Japan found combining <b>enprostil</b> with cimetidine was more effective than cimetidine alone in treating gastric ulcer.|$|E

50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., cloprostenol, flupostenol, latanoprost, and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as <b>enprostil,</b> sulprostone, U46619, carbacyclin, and iloprost are considerably weaker FP agonists. Fluprostenol is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; latanoprost is a suitable substitute.|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo {{controlled}} {{study of}} Latin square design was conducted to determine the gastrin-lowering effects of a synthetic orally administered prostaglandin, <b>enprostil,</b> in fasted and fed patients with hypergastrinemia due to pernicious anemia. The study subjects were one male and six female patients {{between the ages of}} 39 and 76 years with known pernicious anemia and elevated serum gastrin concentrations. In random order patients received twice daily <b>enprostil</b> 350 [*]μg bid, <b>enprostil</b> 700 [*]μg bid and placebo for one week, with a one week washout between treatment phases. Measurements of serum gastrin were performed in the fasting and postprandial states prior to dosing, {{at the end of each}} treatment phase, and at the end of each washout phase. <b>Enprostil</b> 350 [*]μg bid lowered elevated fasting gastrin concentrations, and both doses of <b>enprostil</b> lowered the food-stimulated increases in serum gastrin. When changes in food-stimulated gastrin concentrations were adjusted for pre-meal gasrrin concentrations, there was a consistent dose response between placebo, 350 and 700 [*]μg <b>enprostil</b> bid. All patients experienced adverse events while on <b>enprostil,</b> particularly on the higher dose; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain we re reported most frequently. Thus, <b>enprostil</b> reduced basal and food-stimulated gastrin release in seven patients with pernicious anemia. The mechanism of this effect remains to be established, but it is clearly independent of an effect on acid secretion...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{treatment}} with omeprazole induces hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells, {{closely related to}} hypergastrinemia. We studied whether proglumide, an antagonist of gastrin/CCK receptor, and <b>enprostil,</b> a synthetic prostaglandin E 2 derivative, might inhibit this hyperplasia. Six groups of 8 rats were treated for 10 weeks: a) untreated controls; b) omeprazole 10 mumol/kg; c) proglumide 500 mg/kg; d) <b>enprostil</b> 30 micrograms/kg; e) association of omeprazole and proglumide; f) association of omeprazole and <b>enprostil.</b> Serum gastrin levels were measured at different times during treatment. After sacrifice, fundic argyrophil cells were assessed by Grimelius' staining. Serum gastrin levels and argyrophil cell density were not modified in proglumide- and enprostil-treated groups, as compared with controls. Omeprazole increased significantly these two parameters. When given with omeprazole, proglumide decreased significantly serum gastrin levels and argyrophil cell density, as compared to omeprazole alone, while <b>enprostil</b> did not modify significantly these two parameters. These results indicate that proglumide, but not <b>enprostil,</b> can counteract the omeprazole-induced argyrophil cell hyperplasia in rats. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enprostil,</b> an orally active {{prostaglandin}} E 2 analog, {{is undergoing}} clinical trials {{in the treatment}} of peptic ulcer disease. Because results of animal studies suggested that prostaglandins might affect both hepatic drug metabolizing ability and hepatic blood flow, the effects of <b>enprostil</b> on drug elimination were studied and compared with those of the standard antiulcer drug cimetidine in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of nine normal subjects. Cimetidine reduced the oral clearance of propranolol by 50 %, consistent with the inhibition of drug metabolism reported in previous studies. On the other hand, <b>enprostil</b> had no effect on propranolol elimination. Neither drug altered liver blood flow as assessed either by the clearance of indocyanine green or by the technique of dual route of administration of propranolol.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty two {{patients}} with duodenal ulcer who {{after a short}} term study had relief of pain and healed ulcers proved endoscopically were allocated at random to double blind maintenance treatment with <b>enprostil</b> (a synthetic dehydroprostaglandin E 2) 35 micrograms or ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime for up to 12 months. Patients were monitored every third month and examined by endoscopy at three, six, and 12 months, or more often if warranted. The cumulative relapse rates in the <b>enprostil</b> group at three, six, and 12 months were 37 % (25 / 67), 56 % (37 / 66), and 62 % (41 / 66), respectively. The corresponding rates in the ranitidine group were 8 % (6 / 71), 19 % (13 / 69), and 29 % (20 / 69). These differences were highly significant and further enhanced by life table analysis adjusting for withdrawals and by an "intention to treat" analysis in which absence of proof of non-recurrence was counted as failure, more patients in the <b>enprostil</b> group having been withdrawn because of adverse events or recorded as non-compliant with the protocol. <b>Enprostil</b> 35 micrograms at bedtime cannot be recommended for preventing relapse of duodenal ulcer.

Patients completed the study if ulcer healing and pain relief had occurred at two or four weeks. A total of 163 patients completed the trial.

40|$|Evidence in vivo {{indicates}} that endogenous and exogenous prostaglandins can alter gastrin secretion. We have used primary cultures containing canine antral G-cells {{to study the}} cellular actions of prostaglandins on gastrin secretion, comparing the effects of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and its synthetic analogue <b>enprostil.</b> <b>Enprostil</b> (10 (- 10) - 10 (- 6) M) inhibited gastrin secretion in response to bombesin, carbachol, and forskolin, the latter a receptor-independent activator of adenylate cyclase. This inhibition by <b>enprostil</b> was reversed by treatment with pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml, 8 h). However, <b>enprostil</b> did not inhibit the postreceptor stimuli 8 -bromoadenosine 3 &# 39;, 5 &# 39;-cyclic monophosphate (10 (- 3) M), calcium ionophore A- 23187 (10 (- 7) M), or 4 beta-phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (10 (- 8) M). In contrast, whereas PGE 2 inhibited forskolin-stimulated gastrin release, PGE 2 did not inhibit the response to carbachol or bombesin in control cultures. However, in pertussis toxin-treated cultures, PGE 2 inhibition was reversed and, in contrast, the responses to bombesin, carbachol, and possibly forskolin were augmented. Indomethacin at a dose of 10 (- 5) M did not alter basal or bombesin-stimulated gastrin secretion. However, the somatostatin antibody CURE-S 6 enhanced the response to forskolin and enhanced inhibition by PGE 2, suggesting that endogenous somatostatin produced an inhibitory tone in these cultures and excluding the possibility that PGE 2 acted via release of endogenous somatostatin. Our data suggest that in cultured antral cells gastrin release is regulated by inhibitory and stimulatory prostaglandin mechanisms. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a clinical trial}} to compare the efficacy and safety profile of two prostaglandin analogues, <b>enprostil</b> (35 μg twice daily) and misoprostol (200 μg four times daily) {{in the treatment of}} acute duodenal ulcers in 214 patients. The two agents healed approximately 80 % and in excess of 90 % of duodenal ulcers after 4 and 6 weeks' therapy, respectively. There was a significantly lower ulcer healing rate in both treatment groups in smokers compared with nonsmokers (P< 0. 05). However, daytime and nighttime ulcer pain relief was achieved in fewer than 50 % of patients by either agent. Diarrhea, which occurred in more than 40 % of patients, was the predominant side effect, and occurred mainly during the first 2 weeks of therapy with either agent. Nevertheless, this side effect was mild and self-limiting in the majority of patients. Both agents were found to be safe and well tolerated by the majority of patients. We conclude that these prostaglandin analogues are safe and effective duodenal ulcer healing agents. Furthermore, there was very little difference between <b>enprostil</b> and misoprostol. The limiting factors, however, for their routine use as ulcer healing agents are their low efficacy with regard to ulcer pain relief and the high incidence of diarrhea. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{therapeutic}} {{approaches to}} acid peptic disorders {{have dealt with}} neutralizing or inhibiting aggressive factors and/or bolstering defensive factors. Gastric and duodenal mucosal biopsies were examined from 90 patients with various acid peptic disorders, as follows: reflux esophagitis (n= 24), gastric ulcer (n= 13), duodenal ulcer (n= 47) and nonulcer dyspepsia (n= 6). Seven patients with minimal dyspeptic symptoms and an endoscopically and histologically normal stomach and duodenum served as controls. Immunoperoxidase staining for gastrin-producing G cells, somatostatin-producing D cells and serotonin-producing EC cells was carried out on fundic, antral and duodenal biopsies, and quantitated using a Zeiss MOP videoplan. No significant effects secondary to treatment with antacid, ranitidine or cimetidine were observed on endocrine cell densities and ratios. Biopsies obtained on different occasions over time indicated that in patients on <b>enprostil</b> (a synthetic E 2 prostaglandin), there was a trend towards increasing cell counts, suggesting that the serum gastrin-lowering effect of this drug may result from inhibition of gastrin release. Thus, H 2 -receptor antagonists and antacids do not alter gastric or duodenal mucosal G, D or EC cells in patients with acid peptic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{facilitate}} {{the diagnosis of}} hypercholesterolemia, we {{wanted to create a}} simple and rapid method for diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia in a homogenous population. The PCR method for the FH-Helsinki mutation detected 25 FH-Helsinki positive patients, two of whom had no clinical signs of FH, but had a positive family history for the disease. The method is exceptionally useful in Northern Finland, where 62 % of the FH patients carry the FH-Helsinki mutation. The role of polymorphisms and mutations of the apo B particle as etiologic factors of hypercholesterolemia was studied in a population of moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals. The catabolism of the patients' own LDL was compared to that of a healthy and normocholesterolemic donor, and no major differences were observed. However, the presence of the XbaI cutting site was associated with elevated cholesterol values and a slightly lowered LDL catabolic rate. Patients homozygous for the EcoRI cutting site also had a slow LDL catabolic rate and slightly elevated cholesterol values. The MspI and Ins/del polymorphisms of the apo B particle were not associated with variations in LDL catabolism. The e 4 allele of apolipoprotein E was slightly more frequent in our hypercholesterolemic population than in the average population. The lipid values did not differ significantly between the apo E phenotypes in moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals, nor could we detect any differences in the catabolic rates of their LDL according to the apo E phenotype (individuals with the phenotype apo E 2 / 2 were excluded from the study). In our population of CAD patients, the frequency of the e 4 allele was lower than in CAD populations from Southern Finland (0. 23 vs. 0. 32), suggesting that apo E 4 is not so strongly associated with coronary disease in Northern Finland as in other populations. The E 4 phenotype was associated with slightly smaller LDL cholesterol reductions by colestipol and lovastatin treatment compared with patients with the phenotype 2 / 3. The lipid risk factors of male and female CAD patients were studied in a group of patients admitted to one ward of the Oulu University Hospital. We found the males to have the typical high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol lipid pattern, but women with two- or three-vessel CAD had high LDL and low HDL cholesterol associated with high VLDL lipids, and hypertension, diabetes or smoking. Pharmacological treatment of hypercholesterolemia was studied by comparing lovastatin to colestipol, and in a separate study where a new drug, <b>enprostil</b> was used. <b>Enprostil,</b> whose main effect is on the gastrointestinal tract, would be a useful alternative for long-term treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, however, gastrointestinal side-effects limit its long-term use. Colestipol reduced plasma LDL cholesterol and elevated plasma HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, but it, too, caused gastrointestinal side-effects. Lovastatin proved to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering drug with the least side-effects, and statins have now been established as the most widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin (PG) E 2 (PGE 2) is {{a potent}} prostanoid derived from arachidonic which can {{interact}} with EP 1, EP 2, EP 3 and EP 4 prostanoid receptor subtypes. Recombinant human EP 4 receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK- 293) cells were evaluated for their binding characteristics using [3 H]-PGE 2 and a broad panel of natural and synthetic prostanoids in order to define their pharmacological properties. [3 H]-PGE 2 binding was optimal in 2 -[N-Morpholino]ethanesulphonic acid (MES) buffer (pH[*] 6. 0) yielding 98 ± 0. 7 % specific binding. The receptor displayed high affinity (Kd= 0. 72 ± 0. 12 [*]nM; n= 3) for [3 H]-PGE 2 and interacted with a saturable number of binding sites (Bmax= 6. 21 ± 0. 84 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1 protein). In competition studies, PGE 2 (Ki= 0. 75 ± 0. 03 [*]nM; n= 12) and PGE 1 (Ki= 1. 45 ± 0. 24 [*]nM; n= 3) displayed high affinities, as did two derivatives of PGE 1, namely 11 -deoxy-PGE 1 (Ki= 1. 36 ± 0. 34 [*]nM) and 13, 14 -dihydro-PGE 1 (Ki= 3. 07 ± 0. 29 [*]nM). Interestingly, synthetic DP receptor-specific agonists such as BW 245 C (Ki= 64. 7 ± 1. 0 [*]nM; n= 3) and ZK 118182 (Ki= 425 ± 42 [*]nM; n= 4), and the purported EP 3 receptor-specific ligand <b>enprostil</b> (Ki= 43. 1 ± 4. 4 [*]nM), also displayed high affinity for the EP 4 receptor. Two known EP 4 receptor antagonists were weak inhibitors of [3 H]-PGE 2 binding akin to their known functional potencies, thus: AH 23848 (Ki= 2690 ± 232 [*]nM); AH 22921 (Ki= 31, 800 ± 4090 [*]nM).

40|$|FVMany {{different}} dosage schedules of antisecretory {{drugs for}} the treatment of duodenal ulcer are recommended. The relationship between degree of acid suppression and therapeutic efficacy has not been precisely defined for these drugs. We have examined the association between suppression of intragastric acidity and duodenal ulcer healing rates for a number of therapeutic regimens. For the H 2 receptor antagonists alone, the most significant correlation with healing rates was with suppression of intragastric acidity at night (r = 0. 926; p = 0. 0001). When other classes of drug: high dose antacid, omeprazole and a synthetic prostaglandin (<b>enprostil)</b> were included in the analysis, the closest correlation was with suppression of total 24 hour intragastric acidity (r = 0. 911; p less than F 0. 0001). Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relative contributions to healing of suppression of acidity during the day and night. Suppression of nocturnal acidity was found to be the single most important factor in explaining healing rates. No further benefit was obtained with daytime suppression for H 2 receptor antagonists; suppression of acidity at night accounted for 86. 1 % of the observed variation in healing rates among different regimens of H 2 receptor antagonists. When all classes of drugs were analysed, inclusion of daytime suppression produced a significant improvement in correlation over nocturnal suppression alone. Drug regimens providing potent suppression of nocturnal acidity produce the highest healing rates in controlled clinical trials. The healing rate for any dose regimen of an antisecretory drug can be predicted from a knowledge of its effect on intragastric acidity. For the H 2 receptor antagonists, suppression of nocturnal acidity is the most relevant in this context. Moderate suppression of acidity achieves ulcer healing rates at four to eight weeks which are comparable with those seen with potent suppression at two to four weeks. Increasing degrees of suppression merely accelerate healing...|$|E
