5000|$|The {{application}} of the spray drying encapsulation technique is to prepare [...] "dehydrated" [...] powders of substances which {{do not have any}} water to dehydrate. For example, instant drink mixes are spray dries of the various chemicals which make up the beverage. The technique was once used to remove water from food products; for instance, in the preparation of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk.</b> Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because spray drying causes thermal degradation, milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim milk powders are still widely produced using spray drying technology around the world, typically at high solids concentration for maximum drying efficiency. Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.|$|E
50|$|In February 1944 Anellis {{joined the}} newly created U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps Food and Container Institute in Chicago, and worked on {{problems}} of the microbiological safety of foods being shipped overseas to U.S. servicemen. <b>Dehydrated</b> <b>milk</b> and dehydrated eggs were products developed at this time for which Anellis tested the microbiological safety. Anellis's research focused on strains of bacteria which were especially heat-resistant, including salmonella and clostridium botulinum. This led to the consideration {{of the use of}} gamma radiation as a food preservative, and Anellis began research on the radiation resistance of bacteria in canned foods. In 1963 the Food and Container Institute was closed and its operations were moved to the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Laboratories in Natick, Massachusetts. Anellis continued his research on the radiation resistance of bacteria at the Natick Labs until his retirement in 1977. While working at the Natick Labs he also participated in the program to develop foods and food preservations for NASA. Anellis was an advocate of irradiation of foods as a food preservative and preventative against microbiological contamination, and testified before the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the safety of human consumption of foods irradiated at low dosage.|$|E
40|$|Instant {{properties}} of agglomerated powders {{are linked to}} the size and structure of agglomerates. In this study, agglomerates structure was investigated through the measurement of their porosity. An image analysis method for 3 D re-construction of particle shape from silhouette was developed to measure the envelope volume of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk</b> agglomerates (1 - 2 mm). With known true density of the powder, the intra-particular porosity of agglomerates could be estimated. It was found that intra-particular porosity increases with agglomerates diameter indicating a fractal structure with a fractal dimension of 2. 64. This allowed understanding the different behavior of large agglomerates settling and dissolving rapidly in water whilst small ones settle and dissolve slowly and must be avoided in a good instant powder...|$|E

40|$|Khoa, a {{partially}} <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk</b> product indigenous to India, was prepared from buffalo milk by boiling it vigorously {{in an open}} pan and reducing its volume to approximately 25 % within 30 min. The hot semi-solid product (Khoa pat) was held at 20 •c for 3 h (fresh, cooled Khoa) or 48 h (swred Khoa); the products were either worked with a pestle in a mortar for 5 min or were left without working. Structural features of Khoa were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Freshly prepared coo led Khoa had a granular structure consisting of protein granules several hundred micrometers in diameter. The granules consisted of intact and partly fused casein micelles and nonmicellar protein. The fresh product was only slightly sandy in the mouth. Large aggregates of lactose crystals developed in the intergranular spaces in unworked Khoa during swrage and sandiness in the stored product was markedly increased. Working reduced {{the dimensions of the}} protein granules and the intergranular void spaces and produced large amounts of fat globule membrane fragments. Individual lactose crystals in worked Khoa stored at 20 °C for 48 h were more uniformly distributed than in unworked Khoa. Storage did not increase sandiness in the worked product; sensory analysis rated this product to be markedly smoother than unworked stored Khoa. Instrumental measurements showed that working significantly decreased hardness and springiness and increased adhesiveness and, to a smaller extent, cohesiveness...|$|E

Foram confeccionadas 12 rações purificadas, peletizadas, contendo esses alimentos, sendo uma referência (purificada), a qual serviu de base para o estudo, sendo estas marcadas com 0, 10 % de óxido de crômio-III. Os peixes (240 juvenis de tilápia do Nilo com aproximadamente 100, 00 g) foram alojados em tanques-rede para o {{manejo de}} alimentação e coleta de fezes. Os tanques-rede, contendo esses peixes, foram mantidos durante o dia em aquários de alimentação (250 L), um para cada tratamento, onde receberam refeições à vontade das 8 às 17 h 30 min horas. Posteriormente, foram transferidos para aquários de coleta de fezes (300 L), também individuais aos tratamentos, onde permaneceram até a manhã do dia subseqüente. O coeficiente de digestibilidade aparente dos alimentos foi calculado com base no teor de óxido de crômio dos nutrientes nas rações e nas fezes. Pode-se concluir que: dentre os alimentos energéticos, a raspa de mandioca e a silagem de milho úmido destacam- se por apresentarem os melhores CDA para a MS e a PB, além de maiores valores de ED; embora a aveia tenha apresentado bom CDA para a MS e PB, não se revelou boa fonte energética para a tilápia do Nilo; a algaroba proporciona excelente valor de energia digestível; e; dentre os alimentos protéicos: o soro de leite, a levedura de álcool e o farelo de coco destacam- se por apresentarem os melhores CDA para a MS e a PB, além dos maiores valores de ED e que a leucena e a soja integral apresentam os piores CDA para a MS e PB e os menores valores de ED. This research aimed {{to determine the}} apparent digestibility of six energetic ingredients: ensiled high-moisture corn, raw oats, urucum, manioc flakes, algoroba and alfafa hay and, five proteic ones: soybean, coconut meal, leucena, alcohol yeast and <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk.</b> 12 purified diets were formulated including these ingredients and one as a reference. All diets were supplemented with 0. 01 % of chromic oxide as marker. 240 Nile tilapia juveniles, with 100. 00 ± 10. 0 g average weight were stocked in cages (10 fish/cage) for feeding and feces collection. During the feeding time (0800 AM - 0530 PM) these tanks were kept in 250 L aquaria, one for each treatment, and fish were fed ad libitum. After that they were transferred to 300 L aquaria adapted for feces collection, where they stayed until next morning. The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) was determined based on chromic oxide concentration on diet and feces. It was concluded that, among the energetic ingredients, the manioc flakes and ensiled high-moisture corn showed the highest ADC for dry matter and crude protein and the best value for digestible energy; although the raw oats had showed good ADC for dry matter and crude protein. it did not {{prove to be a}} good energetic source for Nile tilapia; algaroba showed to be a good source of digestible energy; and, among proteic ingredients, the <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk,</b> alcohol yeast and coconut meal showed the best ADC for dry matter and crude protein and also the highest values for digestible energy; leucena and soybean showed the worst ADC for dry matter and crude protein and the lowest values for digestible energy...|$|E

Nutrient composition of khoa {{is important because it}} goes into the preparation of several indigenous sweet-meats. In the present study the nutrient composition of market khoa samples were analysed. These were compared with the nutrient composition of laboratory khoa samples prepared from pure cow milk or buffalo milk. MATERIALS AND METHODS Market samples-A total of 6 market samples of khcsa were purchased (1 sample from the local area i. e. Vallabh Vidyanagar, 2 samples from the neighbouring Anancl city, 1 sample from Barocla city and 2 samples from Ahmedabad city). These were analysed for the nutrient content. Laboratory samples-Laboratory samples of khoa were prepared from pure cow milk as well as from pure buffalo milk. Preparation of khoa in the laboratory essentially included boiling of SOOgms of whole milk in a stainless steel vessel on a gas stove with constant stirring (approx. 45 minutes) until a solid mass was formed. The samples were cooled and used freshly for analysis. Nutrient composition-The 6 market samples and 2 laboratory samples (one-from cow milk and the other from buffalo milk) of khoa were analysed for their proximate composition, mineral and vitamin content. Moisture was analysed by the standard AQAC (1984) 1 method while total solids was calculated as 100 minus moisture content. Carbohydrate estimation was carried out by the anthrone method (Plummer 1990) 2, fat content was determined by the standard AOAC (1984) method while protein estimation was carried out by the micro Kjeldahl method (Oser 1976) 3 Ash content was determined by the standard AOAC method (1984) 1.

40|$|AbstractCryopreservation of rat sperm is very {{challenging}} {{due to its}} sensitivity to various stress factors. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the optimal cooling rate and extender for epididymal sperm of outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) and inbred Fischer 344 (F 344) rat strains. The epididymal sperm from 10 to 12 weeks old sexually mature SD and F 344 strains were suspended in five different freezing extenders, namely HEPES buffered Tyrode’s lactate (TL-HEPES), modified Kreb’s Ringer bicarbonate (mKRB), 3 % <b>dehydrated</b> skim <b>milk</b> (SM), Salamon’s Tris-citrate (TRIS), and tes/tris (TES). All extenders contained 20 % egg yolk, 0. 75 % Equex Paste and 0. 1 M raffinose or 0. 1 M sucrose. The sperm samples in each extender were cooled to 4 °C and held for 45 min for equilibration before freezing. The equilibrated sperm samples in each extender were placed onto a shallow quartz dish inserted into Linkam Cryostage (BCS 196). The samples were then cooled to a final temperature of − 150 °C by using various cooling rates (10, 40, 70, and 100 °C/min). For thawing, the quartz dish containing the sperm samples were rapidly removed from the Linkam cryo-stage and placed on a 37 °C slide warmer and held for 1 min before motility analysis. Sperm membrane and acrosomal integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed by SYBR- 14 /Propidium iodide, Alexa Fluor- 488 -PNA conjugate and JC- 1, respectively. The total motility, acrosomal integrity, membrane integrity and MMP values were compared among cooling rates and extenders. Both cooling rate and type of extender had significant effect on cryosurvival (P< 0. 05). Sperm motility increased as cooling rate was increased for both strains (P< 0. 05). Highest cryosurvival was achieved when 100 °C/min cooling rate was used in combination with TES extender containing 20 % egg yolk, 0. 75 % Equex paste and either 0. 1 M sucrose or raffinose (P< 0. 05). This study showed that TES extender containing 0. 1 M raffinose or sucrose with 70 °C/min and 100 °C/min cooling rate improved post-thaw motility of rat sperm...|$|R
40|$|Milk is an {{essential}} source of macronutrients and among lipophilic vitamins is significant source of retinol. The contribution of milk to the reference daily intake for retinol varies from 11 % to 16 %, worldwide. The most consumed dairy products are fresh, <b>dehydrated</b> and condensed <b>milk</b> in which the amonuts of retinol are not modified to those of in whole milk. Retinol is essential to ensure a good functionality {{of the immune system}} and plays a critical role in vision, reproduction, cell differentiation as well as growth and development and is found only in animal tissues. The aim of our study was to evaluate the interspecies differences in the retinol concentration of whole raw bovine, caprine and ovine milk and to observe seasonal variation of retinol in bulk tank milk samples. Samples of raw milk were colleceted on different farms in the Czech Republic between 2013 and 2014. Retinol was measured by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (325 nm) in isocratic mode after alkaline saponification with methanolic potassium hydroxide solution and liquid-liquid extraction into non polar organic solvent of whole raw milk. To avoid vitamin losses or degradation during the procedure, antioxidants were added to the sample extraction media. Our results indicate significant interspecies differences between bovine and ovine milk and caprine and ovine milk. Concentration of retinol is very similar in bovine and caprine milk 0. 96 ± 0. 11 mg/L, 0. 94 ± 0. 25 mg/L, respectively. The mean concentration in sheep´s milk is 1. 75 ± 0. 24 mg/L. The seasonal variation of retinol in raw bovine milk was detected as high significant, with the highest concentration during winter. These results contribute to the nutrition evaluation of milk in the Czech Republic and indicate, that the sheep´s milk is the best source of retinol among the milks of ruminants kept in the Czech Republic, however it is not used in its fluid form for human consumption. <!

40|$|Traditionally, Malaysian women (Malay, Indian and Chinese) breastfed {{their infants}} {{as a matter}} of course and for an {{extended}} period of time; only elite Chinese women might have resorted to a wet-nurse. But the introduction of condensed and <b>dehydrated</b> <b>milk</b> in colonial Malaya from the late nineteenth century, and the later marketing also of commercially manufactured baby foods, let to some variation in traditional practice. Structural changes, industrialisation and urbanisation affected social as well as economic life, and again these broad changes had an impact on infant feeding. Today, few women remain unfamiliar with the wide range of infant food products sold in the most isolated provision shops. This paper focuses on key sociological factors that might predict the frequency and duration of breastfeeding and weaning patterns. The data analysed below, collected during semi-structured interviews with 278 women presenting at Maternal and Child Health Clinics in Peninsular Malaysia, are in part confusing. They suggest that the women most likely to bottle feed only or to breast feed for a short period, and to use commercial baby foods, are young, with one child only, who reside in urban or peri-urban areas and have a reasonable household income. Higher educated women, and women whose husbands are in non-traditional occupations, are also less likely to breastfeed or to do so for an extended period. But the profile of infant feeding practices is by no means clear. One of the shortcomings of the study relates to the method of collection of data, and highlights the need for detailed ethnographic studies to better explore the variability and complexity of the patterns of infant feeding. ...|$|E
