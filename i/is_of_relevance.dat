2500|$|Chapter 7 {{begins the}} {{examination}} of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by {{the angle of the}} horizon which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny [...] and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections. [...] Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars and constellations involved. [...] The resulting prediction <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.|$|E

We study the quantum coherent dynamics for a tilted, periodic potential, which results in genuine quantum oscillations of the inflaton field, analogous to Bloch oscillations in condensed matter and atomic systems.
