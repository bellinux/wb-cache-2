To Swift, the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism. She deemed [...] "Love Story" [...] {{one of her most}} romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song. In retrospect, Swift said the song is [...] "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding [...] "I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [...] maybe your friends wouldn't accept." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{team also}} worked on The Hunter, a free-to-play hunting video game. The {{game is a}} {{commercial}} success for Avalanche, with Sundberg claiming that the title [...] "contribute quite a lot to [...] financial success". Avalanche considered The Hunter to be an experiment <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether the free-to-play business model suited the company or not. Renegade Ops is another original title from Avalanche. It is a top down shooter which had drawn inspirations from 1986's Jackal, 1992's [...] and 1993's Cannon Fodder. The team aimed to [...] "recreate classics" [...] with Renegade Ops, similar to 2010's Shadow Complex. The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Avalanche Studios' first mobile game, titled Rumble City, is a strategy board game which takes inspiration from the American bike culture during the 1960s. It was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android devices. Avalanche Studios was set to be collaborating with Square Enix {{on the development of}} the airship segment of Final Fantasy XV. However, it was later revealed that the company only provided information to them, instead of working directly with them.|$|E

Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

[...] She claimed she went through [...] "unhealthy" [...] things to book jobs, such as crash and starvation diets, saying those behaviors are common practice among models. She said, [...] "For little girls looking in, it's really not good <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those things." [...] Bisutti decided to quit modeling, a decision her husband supported.

2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who conducted an investigation into how regulators had failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Madoff said {{he could have been}} caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like [...] "Lt. Colombo" [...] and never asked the right questions: I was astonished. They never even looked at my stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been easy <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's the first thing you do.

2500|$|After {{deciding}} {{on the story}} and the main character, he would balance the characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented; when making character personalities, he used the Enneagram of Personality as reference, which classifies people into nine groups; the decision to do this came from {{the importance of the}} number [...] "9" [...] in the storyline of 999. An important thing to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem like bad people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it more difficult <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is. He aimed to not give the player characters strong personalities, {{in order to make it}} easier for players to empathize with them. He chose to have the games be played from a first person perspective as he felt it makes for [...] "a stronger impact" [...] and is more interesting than a third person perspective; it was also used to limit the information that is available to the player in a realistic way, as the player only knows what they experience or are told. Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to want to keep the story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
