25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no other <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> {{is available in}} the dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} some forage feeds of ruminants {{in terms}} of their carbohydrate (CHO) and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Materials and Methods: Eleven ruminant feeds (six <b>green</b> <b>fodders</b> - maize, oat, sorghum, bajra, cowpea, berseem and five range herbages - para grass, guinea grass, hedge lucerne, setaria grass and hybrid napier) were selected for this study. Each feed was chemically analyzed for proximate principles (dry matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, organic matter and ash), fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose), primary CHO fractions (CHO, non-structural CHO, structural CHO and starch) and primary protein fractions (neutral detergent insoluble CP, acid detergent insoluble CP, non-protein nitrogen and soluble protein). The results were fitted to the equations of CNCPS to arrive at various CHO (CA - fast degrading, CB 1 - intermediate degrading, CB 2 - slow degrading and CC - nondegrading or unavailable) and protein (PA - instantaneously degrading, PB 1 - fast degrading, PB 2 - intermediate degrading, PB 3 - slow degrading and PC - non-degrading or unavailable) fractions of test feeds. Results: Among <b>green</b> <b>fodders,</b> cowpea and berseem had higher CA content while except hedge lucerne all range herbages had lower CA values. CB 1 content of all feeds was low but similar. All feeds except cowpea, berseem, and hedge lucerne contained higher CB 2 values. Oat among <b>green</b> <b>fodders</b> and hybrid napier among range herbages had lower CC fraction. Feeds such as bajra, cowpea, berseem and the setaria grass contained lower PA fraction. All <b>green</b> <b>fodders</b> had higher PB 1 content except maize and cowpea while all range herbages had lower PB 1 values except hedge lucerne. Para grass and hybrid napier contained exceptionally low PB 2 fraction among all feeds. Low PC contents were reported in oat and berseem fodders. Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was concluded that feeds with similar CP and CHO content varied significantly with respect to their CHO and protein fractions. Due to lower CC fraction, oat and hybrid napier were superior feeds {{in terms of}} CHO supply to ruminants. Similarly, among all feeds oat and berseem had a lower PC fraction, thus were considered good sources of protein for ruminants...|$|R

It is not my trade, all this mincing and pretending. I have learned the manners of a gentleman, but never those of a courtier. I was right glad then to get into the fresh air again, and I ran away up to my quarters like a schoolboy who has just escaped from the seminary master.|$|E

Within there were two beds, two stools, two washstands--nothing more. It was enough for my wants, for when had I had as much during those twelve years spent in camps? But how was I to get out? Night after night I thought of my five hundred hussars, and had dreadful nightmares, in which I fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing, or that my horses were all bloated with <b>green</b> <b>fodder,</b> or that they were foundered from bogland, or that six squadrons were clubbed {{in the presence of}} the Emperor.

Also there were other fields of <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> whereon were tethered beasts by the hundred, and beyond these, upon the drier soil, grazed flocks of sheep. The town Goshen, if so it could be called, was but a poor place, numbers of mud huts, no more, in the centre of which stood a building, also of mud, with two brick pillars in front of it, that we were told was the temple of this people, into the inner parts of which none might enter save their High-priest. I laughed at the sight of it, but the Prince reproved me, saying that I should not judge the spirit by the body, or of the god by his house.|$|E
50|$|Water buffaloes {{are well}} adapted to a {{hot and humid}} climate. Water {{availability}} is of high importance in hot climates since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to reduce the heat load and thermal stress. Swamp buffaloes prefer to wallow in a mudhole that they make with the horns. Their objective is to acquire a thick coating of mud. They thrive on many aquatic plants and in time of flood will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. They eat reeds, the giant reed, bulrush, sedges, the common water hyacinth, and rushes. <b>Green</b> <b>fodders</b> are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening.

They lay across the whole Peninsula, and our army was so far from home that we did not dare to risk a reverse, and we had already learned at Busaco that it was no child's play to fight against these people.

60|$|Next Sunday a {{distinguished}} doctor came, and, {{when he had}} been fed, some one conceived the notion of interesting him, too, in Flotsam. A learned, kindly, influential man--well-fed--something might come of it, even that 'réforme,' that sending home, which all agreed was what poor Roche needed, to restore his brain. He was brought in, therefore, amongst the chattering party, and stood, dark, shy, his head down, like the man in Millet's 'Angelus,' his hands folded on his cap, in front of his unspeakably buttoned blue baggy trousers, as though in attitude of prayer to the doctor, who, uniformed and grey-bearded, like an old somnolent goat, beamed on him through spectacles with a sort of shrewd benevolence. The catechism began. So he had something to ask, had he? A swift, shy lift of the eyes: 'Yes.' 'What then?' 'To go home.' 'To go home? What for? To get married?' A swift, shy smile. 'Fair or dark?' No answer, only a shift of hands on his cap. 'What! Was there no one--no ladies at home?' 'Ce n'est pas ça qui manque!' At the laughter greeting that dim flicker of wit the uplifted face was cast down again. That lonely, lost figure must suddenly have struck the doctor, for his catechism became a long, embarrassed scrutiny; and with an: 'Eh bien! mon vieux, nous verrons!' ended. Nothing came of it, of course. 'Cas de réforme?' Oh, certainly, if it had depended on the learned, kindly doctor. But the system--and all its doors to be unlocked! Why, by the time the last door was prepared to open, the first would be closed again! So the 'Powers' gave Roche more string--so good, you know, to see him interested in something!... It does take an eye to tell salvation from damnation! For he began to go down now of an afternoon into the little old town--not smelless, but most quaint--all yellowish-grey, with rosy-tiled roofs. Once it had been Roman, once a walled city of the Middle Ages; never would it be modern. The dogs ran muzzled; from a first-floor a goat, munching <b>green</b> <b>fodder,</b> hung his devilish black beard above your head; and through the main street the peasant farmers, above military age, looking old as sun-dried roots, in their dark pélerines, drove their wives and produce in little slow carts. Parched oleanders in pots one would pass, and old balconies with wilting flowers hanging down over the stone, and perhaps an umbrella with a little silver handle, set out to dry. Roche would go in by the back way, where the old town gossips sat on a bench in the winter sunshine, facing the lonely cross shining gold on the high hill-top opposite, placed there in days when there was some meaning in such things; past the little 'Place' with the old fountain and the brown plane-trees in front of the Mairie; past the church, so ancient that it had fortunately been forgotten, and remained unfinished and beautiful. Did Roche, Breton that he was--half the love-ladies in Paris, they say--falsely, no doubt--are Bretonnes--ever enter the church in passing? Some rascal had tried to burn down its beautiful old door from the inside, and the flames had left on all that high western wall smears like the fingermarks of hell, or the background of a Velasquez Crucifixion. Did he ever enter and stand, knotting his knot which never got knotted, in the dark loveliness of that grave building, where in the deep silence a dusty-gold little angel blows on his horn {{from the top of the}} canopied pulpit, and a dim carved Christ of touching beauty looks down on His fellow-men from above some dry chrysanthemums; and a tall candle burned quiet and lonely here and there, and the flags of France hung above the altar, that men might know how God--though resting--was with them and their country? Perhaps! But, more likely, he passed it, with its great bell riding high and open among scrolls of ironwork, and--Breton that he was--entered the nearest cabaret, kept by the woman who would tell you that her soldier husband had passed 'within two fingers' of death. One cannot spend one's earnings in a church, nor appease there the inextinguishable longings of a sailor.|$|E

La mejor dosis correspondió a 6, 4 kg m- 2, presentando el máximo valor de plantas normales. El tercer ensayo evaluó cuatro tiempos de cosecha (7, 10, 13 y 16 DDS), midiendo los parámetros de altura de planta, conversión (materia seca de forraje por materia seca de semillas) y análisis químico del {{material}} cosechado. El día 10 fue el mejor tiempo de cosecha, caracterizado por presentar 36, 86 % materia seca, 14, 79 % proteína bruta, 18, 77 % fibra cruda y una mejor condición sanitaria de forraje. A partir de los resultados obtenidos se pudieron establecer los parámetros productivos y nutritivos básicos para el cultivo de avena como FVH en condiciones de desierto. Productive {{and nutrition}} parameters of oats grown as <b>green</b> hydroponic <b>fodder</b> were assessed by three assays under desert {{conditions in the}} "Pampa del Tamarugal" area of northern Chile. The first assay assessed four seed soaking times (0, 12, 24 and 48 hours). The variables measured were percentage and mean rate of germination. The best treatment was 12 hours of seed soaking. The second assay assessed different seed doses (1. 6, 3. 2, 4. 8, and 6. 4 kg m- 2). The variable measured was the percentage of normal plants 10 days after sowing. The best seed dose was 6. 4 kg m- 2, which had the greatest value of normal plants. The third assay tested four harvest times (7, 10, 13 and 16 days after sowing); the traits measured were plant height, conversion (dry matter of forage per dry matter of seeds) and chemical analysis of harvested material. The tenth day was the best harvest time, which contained 36. 86 % dry matter, 14. 79 % crude protein, 18. 77 % fiber and better sanitary conditions of forage. The results obtained in this study allowed {{the establishment of the}} basic parameters of production and nutrition quality for oats grown as <b>green</b> hydroponic <b>fodder</b> under desert conditions...|$|R
