5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
25|$|Polarization is {{important}} in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in satellite television in order to double the channel capacity over a fixed frequency band. The same <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> {{can be used for}} two signals broadcast in opposite polarizations. By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.|$|E

25|$|DAB is {{not more}} {{bandwidth}} efficient than analogue measured in programmes per MHz of a specific transmitter (the so-called link spectral efficiency), but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which {{makes it possible to}} reduce the reuse distance, i.e. use the same radio <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> more densely. The system spectral efficiency (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2002-2003 season, the TNT channel did {{not have}} any special policy; it was aimed at a wide range of viewers, {{broadcasting}} documentaries, cartoons, television series, etc. There were perspectives for the TNT to get re-profiled into a sports channel, with such a kind of concept the channel claimed to go on air within the broadcast of the 6th <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> in Moscow, but lost to the competition. In the fall of 2002, this idea was partially realized - a TNT-Sports program, created with the participation of “NTV Plus Sport”, was added to the broadcasting grid. At first, it was broadcast in the daytime, but in 2003, due to low ratings, its broadcast was shifted to the night block, and later on stopped.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same <b>frequency</b> <b>channel.</b> If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

All GLONASS satellites {{transmit the}} same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits {{on a different}} frequency using a 15-channel frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 MHz, known as the L1 band. The center frequency is 1602MHz + n × 0.5625MHz, where n is a satellite's <b>frequency</b> <b>channel</b> number (n=−7,−6,−5,...0,...,6, previously n=0,...,13). Signals are transmitted in a 38° cone, using right-hand circular polarization, at an EIRP between 25 and 27 dBW (316 to 500 watts). [...] Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support antipodal (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an earth-based user at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{investigations have}} demonstrated that the stability of mode-locked solution of multiple <b>frequency</b> <b>channels</b> depends {{on the degree of}} inhomogeneity in gain saturation. In this paper, these results are generalized to determine conditions on each of the system parameters necessary for both the stability and existence of mode-locked pulse solutions for an arbitrary number of <b>frequency</b> <b>channels.</b> In particular, we find that the parameters governing saturable intensity discrimination and gain inhomogeneity in the laser cavity also determine the position of bifurcations of solution types. These bifurcations are completely characterized in terms of these parameters. In addition to influencing the stability of mode-locked solutions, we determine a balance between cubic gain and quintic loss, which is necessary for existence of solutions as well. Furthermore, we determine the critical degree of inhomogeneous gain broadening required to support pulses in multiple <b>frequency</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
