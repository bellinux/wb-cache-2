25|$|In Canada, {{breaking}} and entering is prohibited by section 348 of the Criminal Code and is a hybrid offence.

25|$|Section 24B defined seditious {{words as}} words {{expressive}} of a seditious intention, and Section 24D(1) specified that ny person who, {{with the intention}} of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance, writes, prints, utters or publishes any seditious words shall be guilty of an <b>indictable</b> <b>offence</b> punishable by mprisonment for 3 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{return of}} a wife after 18years results in Michael Henchard's {{downfall}} in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). [...] A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas. [...] He becomes a successful businessman and rises {{to the position of}} mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. [...] The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le Marché de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: [...] "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [...] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog." [...] Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that [...] "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [...] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation." [...] Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: [...] "It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate." [...] Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that [...] "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an <b>indictable</b> <b>offence...</b> And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".|$|E

2500|$|Rawle, {{long before}} the concept of {{incorporation}} was formally recognized by the courts, or Congress drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, contended that citizens could appeal to the Second Amendment should either the state or federal government attempt to disarm them. He did warn, however, that [...] "this right [...] ought not...be abused to the disturbance of the public peace" [...] and, paraphrasing Coke, observed: [...] "An assemblage of persons with arms, for unlawful purpose, is an <b>indictable</b> <b>offence,</b> and even the carrying of arms abroad by a single individual, attended with circumstances giving just reason to fear that he purposes to make an unlawful use of them, would be sufficient cause to require him to give surety of the peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} Cruise of the Alert – [...] Four Years in Patagonian, Polynesian, and Mascarene Waters (1878–82), Dr R. W. Coppinger speaks {{of his visit}} to Levuka and meeting Celua. The author {{describes}} him as [...] "a fine-looking man, twenty-three years old ... He surprised us all by speaking exceedingly good English, and possessing an intimate knowledge {{of the ways and}} manners of civilized life ... There was no topic of general interest on which he did not possess a fair amount of knowledge. He wore his hair in the fashion of the country, i.e., in a mop frizzled out to an immense size, and in other respects he was got up as a native chief of distinction. He spoke favourably of British rule, although, as we were otherwise informed, he himself had recently acquired a practical experience of the unpleasant consequences attending the commission of an <b>indictable</b> <b>offence,</b> in having to undergo a sentence of three months' hard labour." [...] This book talks about Celua spending three years at University after returning to Sydney with his father in 1874 but no other reference to his tertiary education can be found.|$|E

60|$|However, {{the effect}} was, that Harold summoned a special {{meeting of the}} shareholders, the same being nearly {{identical}} with the Directors of the Hydriot Company, and these contrived to get George Yolland, Esquire, appointed chemist and manager of the works, with a salary of 70 pounds per annum, to be increased by a percentage on the sales! Crabbe objected vehemently, but was in the minority. The greater number were thoroughly believers in the discovery made on that unlucky night, or else were led away by that force of Harold's, which was almost as irresistible by mind, as by matter.

Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set all Somersetshire singing; nor has the malady confined itself to one county. Pratt too (who once was wiser) has caught the contagion of patronage, and decoyed a poor fellow named Blackett into poetry; but he died during the operation, leaving one child and two volumes of [...] "Remains" [...] utterly destitute. The girl, if she don't take a poetical twist, and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho, may do well; but the [...] "tragedies" [...] are as ricketty {{as if they had been}} the offspring of an Earl or a Seatonian prize poet. The patrons of this poor lad are certainly answerable for his end; and it ought to be an <b>indictable</b> <b>offence.</b> But this is the least they have done: for, by a refinement of barbarity, they have made the (late) man posthumously ridiculous, by printing what he would have had sense enough never to print himself. Certes these rakers of [...] "Remains" [...] come under the statute against [...] "resurrection men." [...] What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in Surgeons' or in Stationers' Hall? Is it so bad to unearth his bones as his blunders?

[...] "We know what we are, but we know not what we may be;" [...] and it is to be hoped we never shall know, if a man who has passed through life with a sort of éclat is to find himself a mountebank on the other side of Styx, and made, like poor Joe Blackett, the laughing-stock of purgatory. The plea of publication is to provide for the child; now, might not some of this 'Sutor ultra Crepidaitis' friends and seducers have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography? And then his inscription split into so many modicums!--"To the Duchess of Somuch, the Right Hon. So-and-So, and Mrs. and Miss Somebody, these volumes are," [...] etc. etc.--why, this is doling out the [...] "soft milk of dedication" [...] in gills,--there is but a quart, and he divides it among a dozen. Why, Pratt, hadst thou not a puff left? Dost thou think six families of distinction can share this in quiet? There is a child, a book, and a dedication: send the girl to her grace, the volumes to the grocer, and the dedication to the devil.|$|E
