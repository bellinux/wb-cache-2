30|$|These {{reports and}} {{associated}} concerns regarding the ubiquitous presences of EDCs {{in the environment}} have sparked both scientific and political debates regarding the need for strategies to assess and regulate chemicals with <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> (ED) <b>properties</b> to protect human and environmental health. To address these needs, a number of countries, multinational governments such as the European Union and inter-government organizations (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD) have initiated or amended programs to integrate EDCs into current strategies to assess chemical safety. These programs include the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA), the Strategic Programs on Endocrine Disruptors (SPEED) of the Japan Environment Agency, and the Joint Working Group on Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment (EDTA) sponsored by the OECD.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe European {{regulation}} on {{plant protection}} products (1107 / 2009) (EC, 2009 a), the revisions to the biocides Directive (COM[2009] 267) (EC, 2009 b), and the regulation concerning chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907 / 2006 ‘REACH’) (EC. 2006) only support the marketing and use of chemical products {{on the basis that}} they do not induce endocrine disruption in humans or wildlife species. In the absence of agreed guidance on how to identify and evaluate endocrine activity and disruption within these pieces of legislation a European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) task force was formed to provide scientific criteria that may be used within the context of these three legislative documents. The resulting ECETOC technical report (ECETOC, 2009 a) and the associated workshop (ECETOC, 2009 b) presented a science-based concept on how to identify <b>endocrine</b> activity and <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> of chemicals for both human health and the environment. The synthesis of the technical report and the workshop report was published by the ECETOC task force (Bars et al., 2011 a,b). Specific scientific criteria for the determination of <b>endocrine</b> activity and <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> that integrate information from both regulatory (eco) toxicity studies and mechanistic/screening studies were proposed. These criteria combined the nature of the adverse effects detected in studies which give concern for endocrine toxicity with an understanding of the mode of action of toxicity so that adverse effects can be explained scientifically. A key element in the data evaluation is the consideration of all available information in a weight-of-evidence approach. However, to be able to discriminate chemicals with endocrine properties of low concern from those of higher concern (for regulatory purposes), the task force recognised that the concept needed further refinement. Following a discussion of the key factors at a second workshop of invited regulatory, academic and industry scientists (ECETOC, 2011), the task force developed further guidance, which is presented in this paper. For human health assessments these factors include the relevance to humans of the endocrine mechanism of toxicity, the specificity of the endocrine effects with respect to other potential toxic effects, the potency of the chemical to induce endocrine toxicity and consideration of exposure levels. For ecotoxicological assessments the key considerations include specificity and potency, but also extend to the consideration of population relevance and negligible exposure. It is intended that these complement and reinforce the approach originally described and previously published in this journal (Bars et al., 2011 a,b) ...|$|R

3000|$|Long-term {{strategies}} of the EU are on the development and adaptation of legislative instruments and policy action that enable hazard identification, risk assessment and risk management of EDCs. Specifically, current initiatives such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Environment and Health Strategy (SCALE) shall serve as legislative frameworks {{in support of the}} regulation of EDCs. Relevant recent developments were the adoption of regulation 1907 / 2006 (REACH), formally adopted on 18 December 2006, the proposal for a directive setting environmental quality standards for priority substances under the water framework directive (2006) or the new pesticide regulation 1107 / 2009 EEC [14, 15] (to be applied in the European Union from 14 June 2011). Specifically, REACH requires an authorization (and/or replacement by suitable alternative substances or technologies) for substances with <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties,</b> for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern as CMR-substances (carcinogens, mutagens, toxic for reproduction - the two highest categories each), PBT-substances (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) and vPvB substances (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). For pesticides with similar properties as these so-called REACH-SVCHs (substances of very high concern according to REACH article 57) no authorization shall be granted according to the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009. Regarding wildlife, the new [...] "endocrine cut-off criterion" [...] states: [...] "An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, {{on the basis of the}} assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines, it is not considered to have <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> that may cause adverse effects on non-target organisms unless the exposure of non-target organisms to that active substance in a plant protection product under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible" [...] (EC 1107 / 2009, Annex II, 3.8. 2). Thus, a paradigm shift in regulatory decision making was introduced for pesticides with endocrine properties: Instead of the established risk-based approach, a hazard-based approach is now required (i.e. only the proven presence or assumed absence of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> shall be decisive for a [non]authorization). However, specific scientific criteria to support regulatory decision making on substances with <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> both under REACH and the new pesticide regulation are lacking today and thus have to be developed and agreed upon (at least in the EU) within the near future.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent EU {{legislation}} has introduced <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> as a hazard-based “cut-off” criterion for {{the approval of}} active substances as pesticides and biocides. Currently, no specific science-based approach {{for the assessment of}} substances with <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> has been agreed upon, although this new legislation provides interim criteria based on classification and labelling. Different proposals for decision making on potential <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> in human health risk assessment have been developed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and other regulatory bodies. All these frameworks, although differing with regard to hazard characterisation, include a toxicological assessment of adversity of the effects, the evaluation of underlying modes/mechanisms of action in animals and considerations concerning the relevance of effects to humans. Three options for regulatory decision making were tested upon 39 pesticides for their applicability and to analyze their potential impact on the regulatory status of active substances that are currently approved for use in Europe: Option 1, based purely on hazard identification (adversity, mode of action, and the plausibility that both are related); Option 2, based on hazard identification and additional elements of hazard characterisation (severity and potency); Option 3, based on the interim criteria laid down in the recent EU pesticides legislation. Additionally, the data analysed in this study were used to address the questions, which parts of the endocrine system were affected, which studies were the most sensitive and whether no observed adverse effect levels were observed for substance with ED properties. The results of this exercise represent preliminary categorisations and must not be used as a basis for definitive regulatory decisions. They demonstrate that a combination of criteria for hazard identification with additional criteria of hazard characterisation allows prioritising and differentiating between substances with regard to their regulatory concern. It is proposed to integrate these elements into a decision matrix to be used within a weight of evidence approach for the toxicological categorisation of relevant endocrine disruptors and to consider all parts of the endocrine system for regulatory decision making on endocrine disruption...|$|E

40|$|This {{concept paper}} for a {{guidance}} document provides a first draft {{based on the}} outcome of a BfR workshop* on how evaluation of endocrine effects of active substances, safeners or synergists to be used in plant protection products might be conducted. Its development has become necessary in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market of the European Community. Even though the criteria developed and the data set used as a basis for toxicological analysis of such substances are considered to be specific for plant protection products, it is recognized that a guidance document once developed might also have implications for other classes of substances such as biocides or chemicals under REACh. It is recommended that the proposed measures should be tested upon a certain number of plant protection products to examine their applicability and to facilitate improvement of the framework. Concerning specific scientific criteria for the assessment of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties,</b> a tiered approach for decision making is proposed reflecting single steps of the regulatory decision process on substances with <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> for their use in plant protection products. In a first step all available data are evaluated in an endpoint-based manner. In a second step mechanisms of toxicity are analysed if present. Human relevance of these mechanisms of toxicity is examined in a third step. The fourth step consists of a decision. In this context two options are proposed which may be regarded as alternatives, representing to some extent complementary procedures: An exposure-based approach and a classification-based manner. *[URL]...|$|E

40|$|The eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) is {{strongly}} affected by xenobiotics (e. g <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> chemicals), {{one of which}} is suspected to be nonylphenol (NP). The project investigates the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> chemical, NP, its effect on the eelpout, and how it degraded from nonylphenolethoxylates (NPE) into NP during water treatment. Scientifical literature is used to describe how NP finds its way to the aquatic environment, which kind of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> effect it has and how the eelpouts life and hormone cycle works. Previous studies are used to describe NP’s <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> effects on the eelpout and other fish species. This study concludes that NP is discharged into the aquatic environment from the water treatment plant. During the water treatment NPE decomposes into NP. The non-branched chains of NP de-compose completely during aerobe process, while the branched chained NP’s are discharged to the aquatic environment and is afterwards consumed by the prey of eelpouts. Experiments show that NP in high concentrations has an effect on adult male eelpouts. This is shown by change in shape and size of the testicles. The em-bryos of the eelpout are expected to be more sensitive to <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupted</b> chem-icals, than grown eelpouts. This is seen by deformities in the eyes, head and spine. The embryos are affected even at concentrations which has no effect on the adult eelpouts.

40|$|As {{regulatory}} programs evaluate substances {{for their}} <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties,</b> careful study design and data interpretation {{is needed to}} distinguish between responses that are truly endocrine-specific {{and those that are}} not. This is particularly important in regulatory environments where criteria are under development to identify <b>endocrine</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>properties</b> to enable hazard-based regulation. Irrespective of these processes, most jurisdictions use the WHO/IPCS definition of an endocrine disruptor (ED), requiring that a substance is demonstrated to cause a change in endocrine function that consequently leads to an adverse effect in an intact organism. Such a definition is broad, and at its most cautious, might capture many general mechanisms that would not specifically denote an ED. In addition, endocrine responses may be adaptive in nature, designed to maintain homeostasis rather than induce an irreversible adverse effect. The likelihood of indirect effects is increased in (eco) toxicological studies requiring the use of maximum tolerated concentrations or doses, which must produce some adverse effect. The misidentification of indirect effects as truly endocrine mediated has serious consequences for prompting animal- and resource-intensive testing and regulatory consequences. To minimize the risk of misidentification, an objective and transparent weight of evidence (WoE) procedure based on biological plausibility, essentiality, and empirical evidence of key events in an adverse outcome pathway is recommended to describe the modes of action that may be involved in toxic responses in non-target organisms. Confounding factors such as systemic toxicity, general stress, and infection can add complexity to such an evaluation and should be considered in the WoE. A recommended set of questions are proffered to help guide researchers and regulators in discerning endocrine and non-endocrine responses. While many examples provided in this paper are based on ecotoxicology, the majority of the concepts and processes are applicable to both environmental and human health assessments...|$|E
