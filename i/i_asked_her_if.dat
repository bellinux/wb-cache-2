2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she would executive-produce. I was hoping she would say yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or if maybe she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got your feet on the ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1942 {{she was a}} star in the Chicago area, {{performing}} at the Rhumboogie Club. The band leader and arranger Marl Young who worked at the club recognised her talent and signed her under contract to the then famous Club DeLisa. [...] A year later, the future owner of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, heard her sing in Washington DC and wrote in his memoirs:"1943, I was about 19 years old; I went to a nightclub in the northeast black district of Washington DC and heard a singer named Little Miss Cornshucks and thought: 'Oh God!' She was better than anything I had heard so far. She came across like a country girl, provided with a headscarf and a basket in her hand and so on; but she could sing the blues better than anyone I've heard to date. That night <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> I could record a record with her. We then played Kansas City and a few other blues numbers and the song So Long. She had such a wonderful sound and I remember how I always thought, 'Oh my God, and I have no record company; I can make the drive just for myself.'" [...] "So Long" [...] became her signature tune and a regional hit in 1943 for the short-lived Sunbeam label.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{he was in his}} room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E

5000|$|Judith Alexander, {{herself an}} amazing personality, {{took me to}} meet Nellie Mae in May, 1980. Nellie Mae was {{welcoming}} and kind person. I saw this scrap of wood that she had paintedto look like a fish. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can buy it. She said {{that she wanted to}} get her nephew a shirt and tie for his birthday. I offered her $30.00 and she accepted.(Sandy Seawright, former contributor Atlanta Art Papers, personal memory, January 24, 2017) ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You didn't. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her.</b> <b>If</b> you'd {{known her}} you wouldn't have asked her.|$|E
60|$|We {{turned over}} some more photographs, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{she had always}} lived at Grimwinter.|$|E
60|$|As {{she was in}} such a {{communicative}} humour, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she {{had dreamed}} at all that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, as {{we pushed}} off I felt somehow {{responsible}} like, and although I'd told the boys before that one reef would be enough, I made 'em put in another before I hoisted the sail. There warn't many boats out, {{for there was}} more sea on than most visitors care to face; but once fairly outside we went along through it splendid. When we got {{within a mile of}} Fley, <b>I</b> <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> we should turn, or go on for a bit farther.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{confidence}} {{which my}} daughter has placed in me goes no further than this. She maintains an obstinate silence, when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she can explain {{the disappearance of the}} Diamond. She refuses, with tears, when I appeal to her to speak out for my sake. 'The day will come when you will know why I am careless about being suspected, and why I am silent even to you. I have done much to make my mother pity me--nothing to make my mother blush for me.' Those are my daughter's own words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam, her fortune {{has been}} the only thing I have had to regret about <b>her.</b> But <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she will not think the {{sacrifice}} greater than I am worthy of." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, after apologising {{for putting}} so many {{questions}} to her, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she could tell me her name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Lynde {{was awful}} mad {{the other day}} because <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she was alive in Noah's time. I dident mean to hurt her feelings. I just wanted to know. Was she, Anne? ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{she liked}} to hear stories; this also puzzled her, and after some cross-questioning I {{discovered}} {{that she had never}} heard a story, and did not know what it meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s coming off, then," [...] said Mr. Tillotson, {{brightening}} visibly. [...] "If {{you will}} wait a minute—if {{the girl is}} in <b>I</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she will go and get us something to drink." ...|$|R
60|$|To this Mrs. Ambient {{had made}} answer {{that it would}} be very awkward when he was about fifteen; and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>if</b> it was his opinion in general, then, that young people should not read novels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing at all," [...] he answered, [...] "except {{to sit in}} {{a corner}} of the room, as far from me as possible, and answer the {{questions}} which <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her,</b> <b>if</b> she be able. You will do that?" [...] turning suddenly towards her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, sir," [...] said Lister, quietly. [...] "I met Miss Hyslop soon {{before your}} boat arrived. Perhaps I ought {{to tell you}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she would marry me if we floated the wreck." ...|$|E
6000|$|And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She {{looked very}} tired and ill, I thought. The {{heaviness}} and languor of her manner were very marked. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: ...|$|E
6000|$|I visited {{my former}} Love [...] As she lay by her husband's side; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> life pleased her, now She was {{rid of a}} poet wrung in brow, [...] And crazed with the ills he eyed; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought her}} rather forward, and didn't {{listen to her}} singing. She only sang at you and Mr. Pendennis, it seemed to me. But <b>I</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> you wish, Harry," [...] and so Miss Amory's name was written on the card with her mother's.|$|R
60|$|By {{now we were}} drawing near to Mameena, and <b>I</b> greeted <b>her,</b> <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> {{she wanted}} anything.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a report}} that Sir Peregrine Oakshott is dead in Muscovy. Nothing has been heard of that unfortunate young man at Oakwood. If he be gone in quest of his uncle, I wonder {{what will become of}} him? However, nurse will have it that this being the third seventh year of his life, the fairies have carried off their changeling--you {{remember}} how she told us the story of his being changed as an infant, when we were children at Winchester; she believes it as much as ever, and never let little Philip out of her sight before he was baptized. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her,</b> <b>if</b> the changeling be gone, where is the true Peregrine? but she only wags her head in answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, {{pretty soon}} they {{contrived}} to fasten up the curtain, {{and then they}} could see out a little over our shoulders. The girl sat directly behind me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she could see, {{and she said she}} could, very well.|$|E
60|$|However, a Wooster's word is his bond. Woosters may quail, {{but they}} do not edge out. Only the keenest ear could have {{detected}} the tremor in the voice as <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she would care to come out for half an hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never spoke}} but once, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{she felt a}} little more easy, {{and she told me}} to hold my stupid tongue. Oh, Miss B., I never thought to have seen this day!" [...] And the water-works again began to play.|$|E
6000|$|... "A small one, but {{she really}} earned her living by teaching. She gave lessons {{to the ladies}} in English, French, and music, and had classes for young boys and girls. <b>I</b> once <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she {{did not intend to}} go back and settle in England, and she said 'Possibly, some day.' ...|$|R
60|$|After that <b>I</b> fell to <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{she was not}} lonely up {{here among}} all these savage people and without any companions of her own age.|$|R
6000|$|... 7. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her,</b> yesterday, <b>if</b> she {{believed}} That I had resolution.

6000|$|One day being discoursing {{with her}} upon the {{extremities}} they suffered, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she could describe {{by what she}} felt {{what it was to}} starve, and how it appeared?

60|$|As I {{jumped from}} my machine and {{approached}} her {{she turned her}} head and looked at me. She was a pale girl, and her face was troubled. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she had hurt herself, she spoke to me without the slightest embarrassment or hesitation.|$|E
60|$|On the {{outskirts}} of the crowd I met Susan, who was almost overpowered with joy at seeing me safe again. I shook her by the hand, but, without replying to her warm-hearted protestations of thankfulness and delight, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she had seen Miss Havelot.|$|E
6000|$|... "As if {{it mattered}} what SHE thought or said or did! It's her {{place to be}} useful <b>if</b> we want <b>her,</b> and we needn't worry about spoiling a girl like that.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{advocates a}} {{philosophical}} and methodological {{approach to the}} medical conversation between doctor and patient. It engages the issue of subjectivity in medicine, focusing on the dialogue between patient and physician regarding health choices and subjective experience. A performatory approach to training physicians to communicate with their patients (rather than a cognitive approach to doctor-patient communication) is described. A working-class female patient tearfully and angrily lashes out at me and all physicians, saying, “I have had all these tests and they can’t help me. They can’t {{tell me what it}} is!” What is the “it”? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> “I choke when I eat, and it hurts here. ” Is that the “it ” you are concerned about? <b>I</b> <b>ask.</b> ‘‘They told me I had these enlarged glands in my neck and then say everything is all right. ” Is the “it ” the confusion? <b>I</b> <b>ask.</b> “I hurt right here, ” she says. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she was angry because she had all the tests and we still were not able to tell her what it was...|$|R
