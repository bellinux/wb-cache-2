40|$|Previous {{research}} on migration has {{focused more on}} the effect of wage differences between the destination and the origin on migration and less on how non-pecuniary attachments workers have to their current location may affect their migration decisions. In this paper, we examine how the presence of a strong social network and desirable location amenities in the current location may deter <b>individual</b> <b>migration</b> across U. S. metropolitan areas. Our empirical results show that, controlling for wage and housing cost differences between metropolitan areas, workers with strong attachments to their current location are significantly less likely to move. Interestingly, the effects of a strong social network and desirable location amenities on <b>individual</b> <b>migration</b> decisions are more important than the effect of wage or housing cost differentials between the destination and the origin. ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} migration intentions in Hubei province in central China. The analysis suggests that temporary migrants {{are more likely to}} migrate than are comparable permanent migrants or nonmigrants. The results also indicate that males are more likely to migrate as individuals than are females. Although age has a great deterrent impact on family migration, being married shows a much greater negative effect on planning an <b>individual</b> <b>migration.</b> Also, family network proves to be more important for determining <b>individual</b> <b>migration</b> than family migration. The results lend support to the notion that temporary migrants in cities do consider themselves as temporary residents and are therefore more likely to migrate again in the near future. They also confirm the argument that different factors play significant roles in individual versus family migration, and highlight the importance in distinguishing the two in empirical studies in developing countries. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a formal}} spatial {{model of a}} hunter-gatherer economy. By assuming that resource locations around a hunter gatherer camp can become congested I obtain {{the size of the}} area harvested as a function of population, resource density, gathering efficiency and time costs of commuting to locations. The model is then extended to include Malthusian and resource dynamics. The resulting dynamic properties are quite rich, with the possibility of stable steady states, as well as stable and unstable cycles. One result is that technological progress can actually cause such economies to collapse due to overharvesting of resources. Next, the model is extended to include the possibility of both group and <b>individual</b> <b>migration.</b> The former removes the possibility of collapse and exploding oscillations but introduces a new source of fluctuations in resources and population. <b>Individual</b> <b>migration</b> on the other hand, {{as long as there is}} no limit on new camp sites which can be settled by daughter colonies, will completely preclude the existence of oscillations...|$|E

In order to preserve these highly mobile species a detailed understanding of their use of feeding and resting sites along the flyway is required. In this study we used light-level geolocators and new analytical tools to reveal individual breeding locations and migration routes of 13 Sanderlings (Calidris alba) that spend their non-breeding season in South Australia. We then used these <b>individual</b> <b>migration</b> routes to identify the timing and location of important stopping areas and compared this with assessments based on resightings of leg-flagged birds and count data. During both northward and southward migration, Sanderlings were found to make extensive use of five main areas of the Chinese coastline, the Yellow Sea and th e northern end of the Sakhalin Peninsula. Insights gained from the <b>individual</b> <b>migration</b> routes highlight inherent biases in using only count and resighting data to identify important feeding and resting sites along the Flyway.

This dataset is unique in that it contains detailed information both on the complete length of migration for each return migrant and the incomplete length of migration for on-going migrants.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from June 16, 2011 - June 16, 2013 This dissertation explores two economic phenomena involving forest-dependent areas: wage distribution and <b>migration</b> pattern of <b>individuals.</b> Are forest-dependent rural areas less desirable for workers {{from the standpoint of}} labor market returns? Are different skills (e. g. education, experience) rewarded differently in these areas? If there are interregional wage differences, would that influence a working-age <b>individual's</b> <b>migration</b> decision and residential location choice? These questions are examined here with data from Public Use Microdata Survey (PUMS) of the United States 2000 decennial census. I focus my inquiry on the socio-economic characteristics of forest and non forest-dependent areas, the interregional difference in labor market outcomes, and the influence of wage differential and other factors on the migration decisions and residential location choice of working-age individuals. Reduced form log wage equations are estimated for individuals, which incorporate explanatory variables related to both skill factors (such as years of schooling and potential experience) and to non-skill factors (such as minority status) potentially influencing wage. Variations in the interregional wage distribution resulting from differences in skill mix of workers are removed by using a standardized skill distribution. The results indicate that average wages and variation in wage distribution are lower in the forest-dependent areas than other areas. For migration analysis, a Partially Degenerate Nested Logit (PDNL) model is used to model migration decisions and location choice of individuals in the Northwest between 1995 and 2000. Migration decision is modelled as a two stage process: first an individual decides whether to move or stay in his/her original location. Conditional on <b>migration,</b> the <b>individual</b> next chooses his/her destination location from a set of alternative areas. Empirical results indicate that educational attainment and labor market outcomes influence <b>individual's</b> <b>migration</b> decision.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process by}} which {{prostate}} cancer cells non-randomly disseminate to the bone to form lethal metastases remains unknown. Metastasis is the ultimate consequence of the long-range dispersal of a cancer cell from the primary tumor to a distant secondary site. In order to metastasize, the actively emigrating cell must move. Movement ecology describes an <b>individual's</b> <b>migration</b> between habitats without the requirement of conscious decision-making. Specifically, this paradigm describes four interacting components that influence the dynamic process of metastasis: (1) the microenvironmental pressures exerted on the cancer cell, (2) how the individual cell reacts to these external pressures, (3) the phenotypic switch of a cell to gain the physical traits required for movement, and (4) {{the ability of the}} cancer cell to navigate to a specific site. A deeper understanding of each of these components will lead to the development of novel therapeutics targeted to interrupt previously unidentified steps of metastasis...|$|R
