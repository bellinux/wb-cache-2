5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as Archdeacon of Ely, with the {{appointment}} occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade. Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he {{did not return to}} his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.|$|E

Indira {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister by Reddy for what would become her last term in office in January 1980. Between 1980 and 1982 President Reddy led seven state visits abroad, visiting the USSR, Bulgaria, Kenya, Zambia, the UK, Ireland, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ireland and Yugoslavia. At home, as President, he signed an ordinance that gave the new government wide powers to imprison people for up to a year without trial under preventive detention and ordered the imposition of President's rule in nine opposition-ruled states on the advice of the government.|$|E

5|$|Edward <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Scotland {{once again}} in 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him the {{commander}} of the rearguard at the siege of Caerlaverock. In the spring of 1301, the King declared Edward the Prince of Wales, granting him the earldom of Chester and lands across North Wales; he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify the region, and that it would give his son some financial independence. Edward received homage from his Welsh subjects and then joined his father for the 1301 Scottish campaign; he took an army of around 300 soldiers north with him and captured Turnberry Castle. Prince Edward also took part in the 1303 campaign during which he besieged Brechin Castle, deploying his own siege engine in the operation. In the spring of 1304, Edward conducted negotiations with the rebel Scottish leaders on the King's behalf and, when these failed, he joined his father for the siege of Stirling Castle.|$|E

As there was a legend of a White Lady foretelling {{the deaths of the}} Hohenzollern, Frederick took his wife's outburst seriously and ordered that precautions be taken for his residence city. Among other measures, he ordered the construction of a pest house outside the city walls, the Berlin Charité.|$|E

25|$|When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> IP in 1962 as {{president}} and editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E

These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

He was most famous for his aggressive foreign policy in Europe, Mexico, and worldwide. He helped in the unification of Italy by fighting the Austrian Empire and joined the Crimean War {{on the side of the}} United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. His empire collapsed after being defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. France gave up monarchs and became the democratic but anti-clerical French Third Republic, which lasted until 1940.|$|E

At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari were restored. In 1823, Victor Emmanuel I issued the editto delle chiudende (Enclosures Act), a legislative act that abolished all community latifundias, introducing the private property and provoking heavy protests from Sardinians. In 1847, under King Charles Albert, with the so-called Perfect fusion were abolished all the administrative differences between Sardinia and the Italian mainland: this manoveur has been made it out to be the only one possible in order to grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the Kingdom, that would become a unitary state and the basic legislation of the future united Italy as well.|$|E
25|$|After the {{normalization}} of relations with the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia, Mieszko <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> his plans of conquest of the more western part of Pomerania. On 21 September 967 the Polish-Bohemian troops prevailed in the decisive battle against the Wolinians led by Wichmann the Younger, which gave Mieszko the control over {{the mouth of the}} Odra River. The German margraves had not opposed Mieszko's activities in Pomerania, perhaps even supported them; the death of the rebellious Wichmann, who succumbed to his wounds soon after the battle, may have been in line with their interests. A telling incident took place after the battle, a testimony to Mieszko's high standing among the Empire's dignitaries, just one year after his baptism: Widukind of Corvey reported that the dying Wichmann asked Mieszko to hand over Wichmann's weapons to Emperor Otto I, to whom Wichmann was related. For Mieszko the victory had to be a satisfying experience, especially in light of his past defeats inflicted by Wichmann.|$|E

500|$|Dodner {{said that}} during {{development}} of the game, she travelled to New Zealand once a month with builds of the game for the filmmakers to play, and on which to give their feedback, and that in total, EA had acquired {{a quarter of a}} million different assets from the production. Schofield further pointed out [...] "we even hired the same stunt doubles from the movie to help us render the most realistic movements in the game." [...] Dobner also said [...] "we want the game to not just look like the films but to be exactly like the films." [...] She commented that no details in the game were made up; [...] "when we were reproducing Minas Tirith [...] we felt the team would benefit from being able to see and feel a piece of the actual movie set. Unfortunately, the set had already been dismantled. So, while in New Zealand, I searched the various warehouses to find remnants of the dismantled set. After much work, <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco proudly bearing four bricks from the Minas Tirith set." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} dogfight over England on 24 August 1940, Marseille was {{involved}} in a four-minute battle with a skilled opponent. He defeated his opponent by pulling up into a tight chandelle, to gain an altitude advantage before diving and firing. The British fighter was struck in the engine, pitching over and diving into the English Channel; this was Marseille's first victory. Marseille was then engaged from above by more Allied fighters. By pushing his aircraft into a steep dive then pulling up metres above the water, Marseille escaped from the machine gun fire of his opponents: [...] "skipping away over the waves, I made a clean break. No one followed me and <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Leeuwarden [...]" [...] The act was not praised by his unit. Marseille was reprimanded when it emerged he had abandoned his wingman, and staffel to engage the opponent alone. In so doing, Marseille had violated a basic rule of air combat. Marseille did not take any pleasure in this victory and found it difficult to accept the realities of aerial combat.|$|E

500|$|On 8 May 1660, the heralds at {{the command}} of the Convention Parliament proclaimed Charles II, King at Westminster Hall Gate. It was said that William Ryley, who was {{originally}} appointed Lancaster Herald by Charles I but then sided with Cromwell, did not even have a tabard with the Royal Arms, as his own had been [...] "plundered in the wars". He had to borrow a decorative one from the tomb of James I in Westminster Abbey instead; the garment was duly returned the next day. The Restoration of Charles II annulled all the Acts of the Parliament and all {{the actions of the}} Lord Protector, without penalising any of their supporters (except for the regicides). Accordingly, all the grant of arms of the Commonwealth College was declared null and void. Furthermore, all heralds appointed during the Interregnum lost their offices, while those appointed originally by Charles <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> their places. The exception was Edward Bysshe, who was removed as Garter, but was instead appointed Clarenceux in 1661, much to the chagrin of Garter Edward Walker.|$|E
500|$|The {{weakening}} of royal authority under Stephen V of Hungary allowed the House of Šubić {{to regain their}} former role in Dalmatia. In 1274, Stjepko Šubić of Bribir died, and Paul I Šubić of Bribir succeeded him as the family elder. Soon, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, recognizing {{the balance of power}} in Dalmatia, named Paul I as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. Ladislaus IV died in 1290 leaving no sons, and a civil war between rival candidates, pro-Hungarian Andrew III of Hungary, and pro-Croatian Charles Martel of Anjou, started. Charles Martel's father Charles II of Naples, awarded all Croatia from Gvozd Mountain (...) to the river Neretva mouth hereditary to Paul I Šubić of Bribir. Thus, Charles converted Paul's personal position as Ban into a hereditary one for the Šubić family. All the other nobles in this region, were to be vassals of Paul Šubić. In response, Andrew III in 1293 issued a similar charter for Paul Šubić. During this struggle over the throne, George I Šubić of Bribir, Ban Paul's brother went to Italy, visiting the pope and the Naples court. In August 1300, George <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Split, bringing Charles Robert with him. Paul Šubić accompanied Charles Robert (later known as Charles I of Hungary) to Zagreb, where he was recognized as king; then they proceeded to Esztergom, where, in 1301, the Archbishop of Esztergom crowned him as King of Hungary and Croatia.|$|E
