[...] In the second verse, she sings: [...] "You'll never need two, because I will be your number one / Them other chicks are superficial / But I know you know I'm the one / That's why I'm all into you / ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though he loved it, he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got a little crazy using Olivia’s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... {{you have to give}} Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, fascinating, and dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> it does." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing Dot, Brown has said, [...] "I love playing her– she's {{a strong}} character. Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has that awful worried {{expression on her face}} the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state– <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is".|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys {{said that}} he {{considered}} the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be The KLF. Neil Tennant added that [...] "They have an incredibly recognisable sound. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they said EMF nicked the F from KLF. They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters." ...|$|R

500|$|Cake {{incorporates}} {{a wide range}} of genres into its music, including country music, Mariachi, new wave, college rock, jazz, funk, Iranian folk music, Brazilian music and hip hop. McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Zé, the Golden Gate Quartet and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for three things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines, McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics, and his [...] "droll, deadpan...monotone" [...] vocals. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; [...] "A lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> it's a contrapuntal thing, where the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time".|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

60|$|Tell Margaret that if {{you ever}} come to live in California, that you can promise her a home for a hundred years, and a bully one--but she wouldn't like the country. Some people are {{malicious}} enough {{to think that if}} the devil were set at liberty and told to confine himself to Nevada Territory, that he would come here--and look sadly around, awhile, and then get homesick and go back to hell again. But I hardly believe it, you know. I am saying, mind you, that Margaret wouldn't like the country, perhaps--nor the devil either, for that matter, or any other man but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> it rains here, it never lets up till it has done all the raining it has got to do--and after that, there's a dry spell, you bet.

Studio owner Russell Webster: [...] "Andrew Eldritch spent a whole month on his own at the studio. We {{had a lot of fun}} together and I loved his dynamic music so much that I thought I should do something similar myself."

60|$|My head {{is singing}} with Otto; {{for the first}} two weeks I wrote and revised and only {{finished}} IV chapters: last week, I have just drafted straight ahead, and I have just finished Chapter XI. It will want a heap of oversight and much will not stand, but the pace is good; about 28 Cornhill pp. drafted in seven days, and almost all of it dialogue--indeed I may say all, for I have dismissed the rest very summarily in the draft: one can always tickle at that. At the same rate, the draft should be finished in ten days more; and then I shall have the pleasure of beginning again at the beginning. Ah damned job! I have no idea whether or not Otto will be good. It is all pitched pretty high and stilted; almost like the Arabs, at that; but of course there is love-making in Otto, and indeed a good deal of it. I sometimes feel very weary; but the thing travels--and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> I am at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we're {{not on the}} {{round-up}} all the time," [...] he said, relaxing a little. [...] "It's pretty quiet part of the time; that is, {{quiet for}} our country. But then, you're always on a horse and you're out in the air on the plains with the mountains in sight. There's {{a lot of hard}} work about it, too, and it's lonesome sometimes when your're ridin' the lines, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> it gets a little too tame for me I hit the trail for the mountains with an Indian. The Ogallalahs are my friends, and I'm going to spend the winter with them and then go into the West Elk country. I'm due to kill a grizzly this year and some mountain sheep." [...] He was started now, and Mary had only to listen. [...] "Before I stop, I'm going to know all there is to know of the Rocky Mountains. With ol' Kintuck and my Winchester I'm goin' to hit the sunset trail and hit it hard. There's nothing to keep me now," [...] he said with a sudden glance at her. [...] "It don't matter where I turn up or pitch camp. I reckon I'd better not try to be a cattle king." [...] He smiled bitterly and pitilessly at the poor figure he cut. [...] "I reckon I'm a kind of a mounted hobo from this on." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Backwoods" [...] was co-written by Moore himself, {{along with}} the {{producer}} of the song and album, Jeremy Stover, and Jamie Paulin. Moore told The Boot that the song was written in about 20 minutes. Moore says, [...] "One of us just started rambling, {{and the other one}} started playing the groove of it. Some songs you write and know it's a really good song, then some of them you get into the studio and it comes to life then. This was one of those songs. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote <b>it,</b> but <b>when</b> we got done doing it in the studio, we both went, 'Man, this has got to go on the album!'" ...|$|R
