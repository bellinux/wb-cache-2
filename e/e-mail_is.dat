25|$|One of {{the most}} popular Internet-related {{technologies}} to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style. <b>E-mail</b> <b>is</b> rapidly replacing traditional letter-writing because of its convenience, speed and spontaneity. It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, <b>e-mail</b> <b>is</b> no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.|$|E

25|$|<b>E-mail</b> <b>was</b> first invented for CTSS {{and similar}} time sharing {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s. At first, <b>e-mail</b> <b>was</b> {{possible}} only between different accounts on the same computer (typically a mainframe). ARPANET allowed different computers {{to be connected to}} allow <b>e-mails</b> to <b>be</b> relayed from computer to computer, with the first ARPANET e-mail being sent in 1971. Multics also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s.

2500|$|Some of {{the players}} {{suggested}} the <b>e-mail</b> <b>was</b> intended as humorous irony. Administrators asserted the <b>e-mail</b> <b>was</b> an imitation of Patrick Bateman, the protagonist in the Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, which was read and lectured upon {{in more than one}} Duke class, as shown by the e-mail responses from other players. One response read, [...] "I'll bring the Phil Collins," [...] another reference to the American Psycho book and film. Police released the McFadyen e-mail but refused to release the following e-mail exchanges, leaving the impression that the McFadyen <b>e-mail</b> <b>was</b> actually intended as a serious threat. McFadyen thereafter received a thousand death threats in one week.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2017, United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor {{dismissed}} the defamation claims against Techdirt, {{but declined to}} strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP law. In his ruling, Saylor wrote that definitions of [...] "email" [...] vary widely. Therefore, [...] "whether plaintiff's claim to have invented <b>e-mail</b> <b>is</b> 'fake' depends upon the operative definition of 'e-mail.' Because the definition {{does not have a}} single, objectively correct answer, the claim is incapable of being proved true or false." [...] Harder said they would appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic mail, often {{shortened}} to <b>e-mail,</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} of creating, transmitting, or storing primarily text-based human communications with digital communications systems.

2500|$|While e-mail {{has been}} blamed for students’ {{increased}} usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that <b>e-mail</b> <b>is</b> [...] "not a threat, for language education" [...] because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness {{can act as a}} domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, Farhad Manjoo {{wrote on}} The New York Times blog about Gmail's [...] "on behalf of" [...] tag. Manjoo explained: [...] "The {{problems}} is, {{when you try}} to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, [...] "From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com." [...] Manjoo further wrote that [...] "Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the <b>e-mail</b> <b>is</b> honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software". The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the [...] "On behalf of" [...] tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers.|$|E

Upon learning of the acquisition of the e-mails by Loving Care, Stengart's attorney, Donald Jacobs filed a motion in Bergen County court for all <b>e-mails</b> to <b>be</b> returned and that copies be destroyed. Mr. Jacobs' motion was denied, and the trial court held that Loving Care's use of the <b>e-mails</b> would <b>be</b> permitted in court.

2500|$|Membership to the Church is {{gained by}} paying $225 and filling out a {{registration}} statement, and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees. The church emphasizes {{that one does}} not have to join the organization to consider oneself a Satanist, and that one only needs to recognize himself in The Satanic Bible and live according to the tenets outlined therein. The Church claims they do not solicit memberships nor proselytize. As the Church does not publicly release membership information, it is not known how many members belong to the Church. However, according to an interview with the Church of Satan, [...] "interest in the Church of Satan and Satanism is growing all the time if our mailboxes, answering and fax machines, and <b>e-mail</b> <b>is</b> any indication."
