5000|$|In French, [...] {{refers to}} the use of English words {{sometimes}} regarded as unwelcome imports or as bad slang. An example would be [...] (also [...] ). Though [...] is often used informally in many French dialects, Canadians would use [...] ('the end of the week') instead, although [...] in France {{refers to the}} end of the work week, i.e. Thursday and Friday. [...] also refers to nouns created from Anglo-Saxon roots or from recent English loanwords (themselves not always Anglo-Saxon in origin), often by adding -ing at the end of a popular word - e.g., [...] ('a car park or parking lot' is more properly [...] in Canadian French, although [...] means 'the action of parking or the state of being parked' in European French); un camping ('a campsite'); and [...] ('shampoo', but pronounced , not [...] ), a term that has become standardized and has appeared on many French <b>hair-care</b> <b>product</b> labels since at least the 1990s. A few words that have entered use in French are derived from English roots but are not found at all in English, such as [...] ('a makeover'), and [...] ('a rugby player'). Others are based on mistaken ideas about English words, e.g.: un [...] meaning 'a jog or a run' rather than 'a pediment'; [...] meaning 'a tram', not 'a tram-track'; and , which is widely used by French speakers to mean 'a prostitute' rather than 'a female dog' or its more frequent English slang meaning of 'a disagreeable woman'. Still others are based on misapprehensions of English punctuation, e.g. [...] (with the apostrophe in both singular and plural) meaning 'a lapel pin'; or word order, e.g. [...] meaning 'a walkie-talkie' (hand-held, two-way radio). For those who do not speak English, such words may be believed to exist as such in English.

40|$|Zinc pyrithione (ZPT) is an {{antibacterial}} and antifungal reagent that {{is often}} utilized for the antidandruff activity in hair-care shampoos with a composition level up to 1 % in the formulation. It has some adverse effects to human and animal if consumed orally. A disposable type of cobalt phthalocyanide modified screen-printed carbon electrode (CoPc/SPE) in couple with flow injection analysis (FIA) was developed for easy and selective analysis of ZPT in commercial <b>hair-care</b> <b>products.</b> Under the optimized FIA conditions, the CoPc/SPE yielded a linear calibration plot {{in the window of}} 6 - 576 muM with sensitivity and detection limit of 1. 65 nA muM(- 1) and 0. 9 muM (i. e. 1. 42 pg in 5 mul sample loop), respectively, in 0. 1 M KOH solution at an applied potential of 0. 3 V versus Ag/AgCl.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} in which the relationships between ethnic entrepreneurs and the communities in which they work can be understood.

Several propositions to be tested in future research are developed.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the fine}} cuticular structure of human hair has traditionally been investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Although these techniques are very useful, they require specimens to be coated with metallic films or to be suitably stained. In addition, high vacuum conditions are required that may damage or alter the appearance of delicate cuticular structures. Atomic force microscopy isa relatively new scanning probe technique, capable of imaging surfaces at high resolution under ambient conditions. In this communication, the potential applications of atomic force microscopy for structural investigations of human hair surfaces are discussed. Fine surface structures, such as the exocuticle, the endocuticle, and the marginal band (A- or oMayer), could be easily identified. The technique has also been demonstrated to image hair surfaces in liquid environments, opening the way to in situ studies {{of the effects of}} <b>hair-care</b> <b>products</b> and treatments...|$|R
