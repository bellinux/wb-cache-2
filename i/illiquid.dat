5|$|On 7 March 1995, the {{majority}} of the holding company was sold from Griffiths to Seattle-based John McCaw, Jr. On 12 November 1996, McCaw bought the rest of company. He stated that he was committed to retaining the team in Vancouver. Griffiths was forced to sell the Canucks and Grizzlies following the cost overruns that occurred on GM Place, and the expansion fees to start the Grizzlies had made his company <b>illiquid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own <b>illiquid</b> investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them <b>illiquid</b> in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Private equity is {{also often}} grouped into a broader {{category}} called private capital, generally {{used to describe}} capital supporting any long-term, <b>illiquid</b> investment strategy.|$|E
25|$|Investors seeking {{access to}} private equity have been {{restricted}} to investments with structural impediments such as long lock-up periods, lack of transparency, unlimited leverage, concentrated holdings of <b>illiquid</b> securities and high investment minimums.|$|E
25|$|The studies {{confirm what}} the {{marketplace}} knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy <b>illiquid</b> investments {{only when there}} is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the rate of return to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.|$|E
25|$|Tuten {{tells the}} story of Tallien's {{courtship}} and marriage to Therese, a condemned member of the French aristocracy. When eyebrows are raised by Tallien's show of clemency, Tuten describes in minute organizational detail the sometimes-banal and sometimes-bloody bureaucratic struggle that ensues. The narrative is intercut with the author's account of his own father's life, demonstrating an <b>illiquid</b> literary mechanism similar to that used in The Adventures of Mao.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, in {{a shallow}} and <b>illiquid</b> market, or in a market in which large {{quantities}} of the deliverable asset have been deliberately withheld from market participants (an illegal action known as cornering the market), the market clearing price for the futures may still represent the balance between supply and demand but the relationship between this price and the expected future price of the asset can break down.|$|E
25|$|A free worker cannot {{sell his}} human capital in one go; {{it is far}} from being a liquid asset, even more <b>illiquid</b> than shares and land. He does not sell his skills, but {{contracts}} to utilize those skills, {{in the same way that}} an industrialist sells his produce, not his machinery. The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.|$|E
25|$|Sharia forbids {{both the}} trading of {{short-term}} debt instruments except at face value, and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets (both {{being seen as}} transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty (Gharar)). As a consequence, prior {{to the development of}} the sukuk market, the balance sheets of Islamic financial institutions tended to be highly <b>illiquid</b> and lacking in short and medium term investment opportunities for their current assets.|$|E
25|$|In addition, at the {{recommendations}} of international financial institutions such as International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – aid granters to Mongolia, and discount interest rate loan giver Asian Development Bank, Elbegdorj {{made a decision to}} sell state owned Reconstruction Bank which became <b>illiquid</b> and was experiencing tremendous loss, the biggest financial burden to the economy since its establishment in 1997. Golomt Bank {{was the only one that}} offered to buy Reconstruction Bank.|$|E
25|$|The foreign {{borrowings}} of Irish banks {{rose from}} €15 billion to €110 billion in 2004-08. Much {{of this was}} borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects {{that would not be}} sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result was a classic asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the bank guarantee the banks were said to be <b>illiquid</b> (but not insolvent) by €4 billion; {{this turned out to be}} an enormous underestimate.|$|E
25|$|However, an October 15, 2008, {{article in}} the Washington Post {{analyzing}} {{the origins of the}} economic crisis claims that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives, and actively sought to undermine the office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when the Commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. Meanwhile, Greenspan recommended improving mark-to-market regulations to avoid having derivatives or other complex assets marked to a distressed or <b>illiquid</b> market during times of material adverse conditions seen during the late 2000s credit crisis.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} asset-backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these <b>illiquid</b> assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.|$|E
25|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the European Union. Since the airline's conception, Braathens SAFE had been a staunch opponent to the concession system and an avid proponent of free competition in the airline industry. With a deregulation around the corner, the airline change stands and warned against the consequences of a free market. In contrast, SAS embraced the new system. Braathens SAFE's main concern was that their high debt incurred after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them <b>illiquid</b> in a price war.|$|E
25|$|For most exchanges, forward {{contracts}} were standard at the time. However, most forward contracts {{were not}} honored {{by both the}} buyer and the seller. For instance, if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn, {{and at the time}} of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original contract price, either the buyer or the seller would back out. Additionally, the forward contracts market was very <b>illiquid</b> and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{monetary}} theory distinguishes {{among different}} ways to measure the money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system {{that focuses on the}} liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively <b>illiquid</b> instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.|$|E
25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is <b>illiquid.</b> Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E
25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, private equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in <b>illiquid</b> assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control. Finally, private equity firms only take long positions, for short selling is not possible in this asset class.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, UBS {{announced}} that it had placed CHF 6billion of new capital, through mandatory convertible notes, with Swiss Confederation. The SNB (Swiss National Bank) and UBS made an agreement to transfer approximately US$60billion of currently <b>illiquid</b> securities and various assets from UBS to a separate fund entity.|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, the HS1 {{concession}} {{was awarded}} for a duration of thirty years to an investment consortium bringing together two Canadian public pension funds: [...] Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (through its subsidiary Borealis Infrastructure [...] ) and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan [...] At the time, UK pension investors had generally limited interest for such long-term, <b>illiquid,</b> ‘infrastructure assets’ [...] In 2017, {{the sale of}} HS1 was announced to funds advised and managed by InfraRed Capital Partners Ltd and Equitix Investment Management Ltd.; participants include [...] HICL Infrastructure and South Korea’s National Pension Service.|$|E

2500|$|A {{side pocket}} is a {{mechanism}} whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively <b>illiquid</b> or difficult to value reliably. When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated {{separately from the}} value of the fund’s main portfolio. Because side pockets are used to hold <b>illiquid</b> investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio. Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors. Funds typically carry side pocket assets [...] "at cost" [...] for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values. This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{investments}} are <b>illiquid</b> and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists {{are expected to}} carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, {{in order to increase}} the likelihood of reaching an IPO stage when valuations are favourable. [...] Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development: ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1889 {{inspections}} of the Banca Romana {{by a government}} commission revealed serious irregularities in its administration and accounts and that 91 percent of {{the assets of the}} bank were <b>illiquid.</b> Moreover, the bank's directors had committed a criminal offence by permitting an additional number of banknotes with duplicate numbering to be printed. The Banca Romana had loaned large sums to property developers but was left with huge liabilities when the real estate bubble collapsed in 1887. One of the government reports concluded: ...|$|E
2500|$|Side pockets {{were widely}} used by hedge funds during the 2008 {{financial}} crisis amidst {{a flood of}} withdrawal requests. Side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away <b>illiquid</b> securities until market liquidity improved, a move that could reduce losses. However, as the practice restricts investors' ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged {{that it has been}} abused or applied unfairly. [...] The SEC also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them.|$|E
2500|$|Sellers {{of private}} equity {{investments}} sell {{not only the}} investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds. By its nature, the private equity asset class is <b>illiquid,</b> {{intended to be a}} long-term investment for buy-and-hold investors, including [...] "pension funds, endowments and wealthy families selling off their private equity funds before the pools have sold off all their assets." [...] For the vast majority of private equity investments, there is no listed public market; however, there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{private equity}} {{secondary}} market (also often called private equity secondaries) {{refers to the}} buying and selling of pre-existing investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds.

2500|$|At {{a conference}} in Dubai in January, 2009, he said, the U.S. banking system was [...] "effectively insolvent." [...] He added that the [...] "systemic banking crisis.... The {{problems}} of Citi, Bank of America and others suggest the system is bankrupt. In Europe, it’s the same thing." [...] To deal with this problem, he recommends that the U.S. government [...] "do triage between banks that are <b>illiquid</b> and undercapitalized but solvent, {{and those that are}} insolvent. The insolvent ones you have to shut down." [...] He adds, [...] "We're in a war economy. You need command-economy allocation of credit to the real economy. Not enough is being done," [...] he felt at the time.|$|E
2500|$|An asset-backed {{security}} (ABS) is {{a security}} whose income payments and hence value {{are derived from}} and collateralized (or [...] "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and <b>illiquid</b> assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them {{to be sold to}} general investors, a process called [...] securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{investments}} {{refer to}} investments made in existing private equity assets. [...] These transactions can involve {{the sale of}} private equity fund interests or portfolios of direct investments in privately held companies through the purchase of these investments from existing institutional investors. [...] By its nature, the private equity asset class is <b>illiquid,</b> {{intended to be a}} long-term investment for buy and hold investors. [...] Secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification, particularly for investors that are new to the asset class. [...] Secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile, diminishing the j-curve effect of investing in new private equity funds. [...] Often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle, structured similar to a fund of funds although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions. [...] Sellers of private equity fund investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds.|$|E
2500|$|Diamonds become {{increasingly}} rare when considering higher clarity gradings. Only about 20% of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high {{enough for the}} diamond to be considered appropriate {{for use as a}} gemstone; the other 80% are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20%, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are {{visible to the naked eye}} upon close inspection. Those that do not have a visible inclusion when the gem is examined approximately 6 inches from the naked eye are known as [...] "eye-clean", although visible inclusions can sometimes be hidden under the setting in a piece of jewelry. The most expensive gem diamonds fall within the VS and SI grades with FL, IF, and even VVS stones commanding significant premiums. FL and IF stones are sometimes referred to as [...] "museum quality" [...] or [...] "investment grade" [...] to denote their rarity although the term [...] "investment grade" [...] is misleading as diamonds have historically been <b>illiquid</b> and questionable stores of value.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{although}} {{hedge funds}} {{go to great}} lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. Systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is [...] "herd" [...] behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy. [...] The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in <b>illiquid</b> investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. [...] The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>Illiquid</b> Assets to Total Assets {{should be at}} least 25%. In terms of Shari’ah, <b>illiquid</b> assets are all those assets that are not cash or cash equivalents. Therefore, {{inventory}} of raw material, work in process, among all other fixed assets are considered as <b>illiquid</b> whereas long term investments in interest based institutions are considered to be liquid in terms of Shari’ah.|$|E
50|$|In {{the view}} of John Maynard Keynes, stock {{valuation}} is not a prediction but a convention, which serves to facilitate investment and ensure that stocks are liquid, despite being underpinned by an <b>illiquid</b> business and its <b>illiquid</b> investments, such as factories.|$|E
