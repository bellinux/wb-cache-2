60|$|He went {{in through}} the great gate and across the yard, and passing by the {{well-known}} buttery-hatches, looked into the old hall for the last time. The men were all seated at dinner, {{and he could see}} the fellows up at the high table. Three years ago it had been his fixed resolve to earn for himself the right to sit upon that dais. He had then been sure of himself,--that he would do well, and take honours, and win a fellowship. There had been moments in which he had thought that a college life would suit him till he came into his own property. But how had all that faded away! Everybody had congratulated him on the ease with which he did his work,--and the result had been Newmarket, Davis, and a long score in the <b>ephemeral</b> <b>records</b> of a cricket match. As he stood there, with his slouched hat over his eyes, one of the college servants recognised him, and called him by his name. Then he passed on quickly, and made his way out to the gravel-walk by the river-side. It was not yet closed for the night, and he went on, that he might take one last turn up and down the old avenue.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} part of my {{reassessment}} of the theoretical importance of 2 ̆ 2 Holinshed 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Chronicles, the huge Elizabethan chronicle that appeared in two editions a decade apart (1577 and 1587). The Chronicles are unusually pertinent to negotiations now taking place between disciplines that earlier proceeded in partial ignorance or disdain of each other-law, political history and theory, economics, anthropology, and literary studies. The Chronicles convey significant information {{in all of these}} areas and on their convergences, which may have been greater in early modem England than they later were perceived to be in modem academic thought. I would argue that the Chronicles, which were collaborative projects, were compiled according to several protocols that run counter to certain modem historiographical ideals. These protocols may be summarized as follows. First, one of the functions of a national history was to discover, salvage, and preserve in print ephemeral, manuscript, or otherwise endangered records. In other words, the Chronicles were conceived from the start as 2 ̆ 2 documentary history, 2 ̆ 2 {{as much a part of}} the national archive as were the enrolled statutes stored in the Tower of London. Among <b>ephemeral</b> <b>records,</b> apparently, were previously published pamphlets, such as Sir John Cheke 2 ̆ 7 s Hurt of Sedicion (1549) or Thomas Churchyard 2 ̆ 7 s account of the 1578 festivities for Elizabeth on her progress to Suffolk and Norfolk, which, the chronicler tells us, 2 ̆ 2 it were better to record [...] . than [...] . to let it perish in three halfepenie pamphlets, and so die in oblivion. 2 ̆ 22 ̆...|$|R

This essay takes the particular problem that the scholar of theatre and other forms of performance faces in dealing with events that were <b>ephemeral,</b> and whose <b>record</b> is often inscrutable. I suggest that while "medieval" and "renaissance" are useful tools in aesthetic discrimination, their relationship is more safely viewed like a movement of tectonic plates, rather than in terms of watershed dates...|$|R
60|$|A {{few words}} {{regarding}} the peculiar conditions {{of life and}} society that are here rudely sketched, and often but barely outlined. The author is aware that, partly from a habit of thought and expression, partly from the exigencies of brevity in his narratives, and partly from the habit of addressing an audience familar with the local scenery, he often assumes, as premises already granted by the reader, {{the existence of a}} peculiar and romantic state of civilization, the like of which few English readers are inclined to accept without corroborative facts and figures. These he could only give by referring to the <b>ephemeral</b> <b>records</b> of Californian journals of that date, and the testimony of far-scattered witnesses, survivors of the exodus of 1849. He must beg the reader to bear in mind that this emigration was either across a continent almost unexplored, or by the way of a long and dangerous voyage around Cape Horn, and that the promised land itself presented the singular spectacle of a patriarchal Latin race who had been left to themselves, forgotten by the world, for nearly three hundred years. The faith, courage, vigor, youth, and capacity for adventure necessary to this emigration produced a body of men as strongly distinctive as the companions of Jason. Unlike most pioneers, the majority were men of profession and education; all were young, and all had staked their future in the enterprise. Critics who have taken large and exhaustive views of mankind and society from club windows in Pall Mall or the Fifth Avenue can only accept for granted the turbulent chivalry that thronged the streets of San Francisco in the gala days of her youth, and must read the blazon of their deeds like the doubtful quarterings of the shield of Amadis de Gaul. The author has been frequently asked if such and such incidents were real,--if he had ever met such and such characters. To this he must return the one answer, that in only a single instance was he conscious of drawing purely from his imagination and fancy for a character and a logical succession of incidents drawn therefrom. A few weeks after his story was published, he received a letter, authentically signed, correcting some of the minor details of his facts (!), and enclosing as corroborative evidence a slip from an old newspaper, wherein the main incident of his supposed fanciful creation was recorded with a largeness of statement that far transcended his powers of imagination.|$|R
30|$|In Gangetic India, archaeological {{evidence}} has {{for a while}} been taken to indicate local independent origins of agriculture (e.g. Fuller 2002, 2006 a, b, 2007; Saraswat 2005). Clear evidence for a local domestication process, however, is still missing. Instead, what archaeology has revealed is quite {{a lot about the}} integrated agricultural systems of the very late Neolithic, a period in which continuously occupied sedentary villages become the norm. This mostly dates from 2200 or 2000 BC to the early centuries of the second millennium (Fuller 2006 a, 2011). Earlier occupations are likely to have been more mobile, i.e. this is the problem of “silence before sedentism” which has limited pinpointing that the actual origins of cultivation in much of inner India (Fuller 2006 b). Increasingly, I think this makes sense in terms of early agricultural settlements in much of India being frequently moved due to practices of shifting cultivation, leaving a poor and <b>ephemeral</b> archaeological <b>record</b> and precluding much direct archaeobotanical evidence (Kingwell-Banham and Fuller 2011). Nevertheless the few early sedentary sites with good evidence, such as Senuwar (from 2500 BC), suggest that there was a reliance on rice, probably cultivation, before crops from elsewhere were introduced (Saraswat 2004; discussions in Fuller 2006 a, b, 2011).|$|R
40|$|Within {{the history}} of modern English lexicography, {{individual}} dictionary editors have had ultimate control over the selection, meaning, and illustration of words; extensive collaboration with contributors has been limited. However, Internet technologies that easily permit exchanges between a user and a database have allowed {{a new type of}} dictionary online, one that is built by the collaboration of contributing end-users, allowing ordinary users of dictionaries who are not trained lexicographers to engage in dictionary-making. We discuss a popular online slang dictionary called UrbanDictionary. com (UD) to illustrate how lexicographic principles are joined with Web-only communication technologies to provide a context for collaborative engagement and meaning-making; and to note the many characteristics and functions shared with the traditional print dictionary. Significantly, UD captures what most traditional English dictionaries fall short of: <b>recording</b> <b>ephemeral</b> quotidian spoken language and representing popular views of meaning.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend in the Earth sciences towards the integration of many subdisciplines. The sedimentary basin, is a fundamental focal point of many studies, which as a consequence often neglects the complimentary drainage basin or catchment. Sedimentary basins provide a record of Earth history, reflecting the geographical, lithological, oceanographic and ecological development through the rock record. Drainage basins in comparison <b>record</b> <b>ephemeral</b> landscape evolution, where topography is eroded and provides the flux of sediment to the basin. The basin fill reflects the sediment flux from the hinterland and provides evidence of the dynamic geomorphic processes. In context the drainage system and sedimentary basin {{can be regarded as}} a ?production line? with the sedimentary record giving valuable insight into long-term landscape evolution and geomorphological processes illuminating the evolution of sedimentary basins. This volume assesses the current position of understanding sediment supply to basins with the integration of the many sub-disciplines in the Earth sciences. It documents a mix of hinterland and sedimentary basin studies with a gradation from orogenic belts to the deep marine. The authors represent a wide spectrum of Earth scientists, with leaders in the science providing review papers and new-directive papers in their field of specialization...|$|R
40|$|In the {{two decades}} {{following}} the Second World War, amateur drama groups flourished in towns and villages across regional New South Wales on an unprecedented scale. Unlike pre-war dramatic societies, they engaged {{in a wide range}} of activities, including play readings, full-length productions, drama festivals, playwriting competitions, training courses and the acquisition of little theatres. Despite this prolific activity, the literature is largely silent on this aspect of Australian theatre history. My thesis, the first comprehensive overview of amateur theatre in New South Wales regional communities between 1945 and 1970, will partially redress this neglect. It examines country dramatic societies from the perspective of their place in the local community, their links to the region, and their relationship with Sydney, in the broader context of post-war reconstruction, changes in society and country town life, and the professionalisation of the Australian theatre. Drawing on archival sources not previously used for the study of amateur theatre, local history collections, regional newspapers, <b>ephemeral</b> material and <b>recorded</b> interviews with members and former members of country dramatic societies, my thesis seeks to answer three questions: First, what caused the strong and consistent growth of amateur theatre in regional New South Wales communities after 1945 ? Second, why did it begin to decline from the mid- 1960 s? And third, what impact did this development have on the theatrical and social life of country towns? Three case studies – Wagga Wagga School of Arts Players, Broken Hill Repertory Society and Cooma Little Theatre – illustrate the themes that have emerged from the research. I argue that despite attempts by governments at all levels, and by organisations and individuals in Sydney, to influence the cultural life of regional towns, the fate of country dramatic societies was determined largely by local factors. This gave them a means of preserving local and regional identity during a period of significant social and cultural change. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the stratigraphic and {{structural}} setting of the metamorphic succession exposed in {{the eastern side of}} the Monte Leoni, the southern extension of the Monticiano-Roccastrada Ridge. In the study area, three main tectonic units crop out, which are, from top to bottom: the Ophiolitic Unit, the Tuscan Nappe and the epimetamorphic Monticiano-Roccastrada Unit. They are unconformably overlain by post-orogenic, Neogene marine and Quaternary continental deposits. The Monticiano-Roccastrada Unit consists of Palaeozoic deposits overlain by the Triassic Verrucano Group, represented by the Civitella Marittima Fm. (Early?-Middle? Triassic), the Anageniti minute Fm. (Late Ladinian) and the Tocchi Fm. (Carnian). The Verrucano Group of the eastern side of Monte Leoni lacks the Monte Quoio Fm., which is extensively exposed in the northern part of the Monticiano-Roccastrada Ridge and pinches out southward being progressively replaced by the Anageniti minute Formation. The Palaeozoic deposits comprise the Falsacqua Fm., mainly consisting of normally graded metasandstones and metapelites, locally overlain conformably by a decametre-thick horizon of metacarbonates alternating with subordinate metapelites. The whole Palaeozoic succession exposed in the eastern side of Monte Leoni shows stratigraphic and sedimentological features which typically characterise the Farma Fm., considered in the type-area (Farma Valley, in the central part of the Monticiano-Roccastrada Ridge) as a Moscovian turbiditic deposits. As a consequence these pre-Verrucano deposits represent the southernmost outcrops of the Farma Formation. The Civitella Marittima Fm. unconformably overlies the Palaeozoic deposits and is represented by three members, which are: the basal mainly conglomeratic member, the intermediate mainly arenaceous member and the upper pelitic-arenaceous member. The Civitella Marittima Fm. records a retrogradational fluvial fan setting, possibly represented by coalescing terminal fans. The Anageniti minute Fm. erosionally overlies the fine-grained siliciclastics of the upper member of Civitella Marittima Fm. and consists of finingupwards successions represented by quartzose metaconglomerates, quartzose metasandstones and metapelites. These <b>record</b> <b>ephemeral</b> stream and flood-plain sedimentation, whereas the carbonates and siliciclastic fines of the overlying Tocchi Fm. documents the Carnian marine transgression over such an alluvial plain. In the Monte Leoni the Verrucano Group is formed by two sedimentary cycles. The lower one, stratigraphically corresponding to the lower sedimentary cycle of the Punta Bianca area (La Spezia), is represented by the Civitella Marittima Fm., whereas the upper cycle, comprising the Anageniti minute Fm. and the Tocchi Fm., is referable to the Verrucano succession (Verruca Fm. and Monte Serra Fm.) of the Monti Pisani. Four deformational events (D 1, D 2, D 3 and D 4) related to the Northern Apennines tectonic evolution affected the metamorphic units. D 1 is represented by meso- to map-scale south- and east-verging F 1 folds, with associated penetrative S 1 axial planar tectonic foliation. S 1 consists of a pervasive schistosity, particularly well developed in the metapelites, ranging from parallel to strongly inclined with respect to the bedding (S 0). D 2 is represented by asymmetric east-verging folds (F 2), characterised by overturned to vertical shorter limbs. The F 2 are typified by NE-SW striking axes and subhorizontal to gently NW/SE dipping axial surfaces. A penetrative, axial-planar tectonic foliation (S 2) occurs in the metapelites. D 3 is represented by map-scale gentle folds (F 3) and by disjunctive and widely spaced S 3 tectonic foliation. Finally, high-angle normal faults (D 4) dissect all the previous structures...|$|R
