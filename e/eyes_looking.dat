5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated <b>eyes.</b> <b>Looking</b> directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{with his}} body {{slightly}} turned aside and his <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> down, {{appears to be a}} sad young man. Even the angle of the hat seems to indicate sadness. Both museum paintings were made on large canvas, 65 x 54cm.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E

500|$|Van Peebles wanted [...] "a victorious film [...] where niggers {{could walk}} out {{standing}} tall instead of avoiding each other's <b>eyes,</b> <b>looking</b> once again like they'd had it." [...] Van Peebles {{was aware of}} the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that [...] " [...] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out." ...|$|E
500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} the glass door, making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon which he was experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers simply want her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' <b>eyes.</b> <b>Looking</b> over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing him to feel remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E

2500|$|Dany Roth of blastr.com was {{impressed}} by the show's costume designs, stating that they are [...] "possibly the best on TV right now. Each costume {{tells the story of the}} world, of the people, of the specific character." [...] He said that, like Mad Max, The 100 [...] "understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.", and although [...] "there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting", it is the clothes that tell the story. [...] "I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here," [...] he added, [...] "a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the [...] "most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint." [...] Debnam-Carey said, [...] "I'm lucky they put me in such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? Should we do tears? Should we do the bindi?'" [...] She collaborated with Rothenberg on the makeup and wardrobe for her character, and both collaborated with viewers on fan versions of the designs.|$|E
