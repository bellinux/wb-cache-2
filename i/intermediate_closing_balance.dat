Key words: quantum-cascade laser, energy level population, charge carrier scattering, system of <b>closed</b> <b>balance</b> equations. Introduction. Development of lasers based on quantum-cascade superlattice structures is a promising direction in design of compact and reliable radiation sources in the mid-IR [1 – 5] and far IR [6, 7] ranges. The design concept for a quantum-cascade laser (QCL) was discussed in [8], but the first practical realization is described in [1]. Modern QCLs are grown using the molecular beam epitaxy method and are complicated structures with several tens of repeat-ing cascades, consisting of a system of potential wells and barriers. The populations of the energy subbands are calcu...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms for the Ca 2 +-dependent gating {{of single}} large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ {{channels}} from cultured rat skeletal muscle were developed using two-dimensional analysis of single-channel currents recorded with the patch clamp technique. To extract and display the essential kinetic information, the kinetic structure, from the single channel currents, adjacent open and closed intervals were binned as pairs and plotted as two-dimensional dwell-time distributions, and the excesses and deficits of the interval pairs over that expected for independent pairing were plotted as dependency plots. The basic {{features of the}} kinetic structure were generally the same among single large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, but channel-specific differences were readily apparent, suggesting heterogeneities in the gating. Simple gating schemes drawn from the Monod- Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allosteric proteins could approximate the basic features of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. However, consistent differences between the observed and predicted dependency plots suggested that additional brief lifetime closed states not included in MWC-type models {{were involved in the}} gating. Adding these additional brief closed states to the MWC-type models, either beyond the activation pathway (secondary closed states) or within the activation pathway (<b>intermediate</b> <b>closed</b> states), improved the description of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. Secondary closed states are consistent with the closing of secondary gates or channel block. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>closed</b> states are consistent with mechanisms in which the channel activates by passing through a series of intermediate conformations between the more stable open and closed states. It is the added secondary or <b>intermediate</b> <b>closed</b> states that give rise to the majority of the brief closings (flickers) in the gating...|$|R
40|$|Modulatory alpha-subunits of Kv {{channels}} remain electrically silent after homomeric expression. Their {{interactions with}} Kv 2 alpha-subunits via the amino-terminal domain promote {{the assembly of}} heteromeric functional channels. The kinetic features of these heteromers {{differ from those of}} Kv 2 homomers, suggesting a distinct role in electrical signaling. This study investigates biophysical properties of channels emerging from the coexpression of Kv 2. 1 with the modulatory alpha-subunit Kv 9. 3. Changes relative to homomeric Kv 2. 1 concern activation, deactivation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation. A detailed description of Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 inactivation is presented. Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 heteromers inactivate in a fast and complete fashion from <b>intermediate</b> <b>closed</b> states, but in a slow and incomplete manner from open states. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>closed</b> states of channel gating can be approached through partial activation or deactivation, according to a proposed qualitative model. These transitions are rate-limiting for Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 inactivation. Finally, based on the kinetic description, we propose a putative function for Kv 2. 1 /Kv 9. 3 heteromers in rat heart...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Market {{capitalisation}} is {{a measure}} of size and prestige for various JSE listed companies. Changes in the Companies Act in relation to the capital maintenance provided companies the opportunity to repurchase their own shares. South Africa’s legislation is different to those of its international peers which resulted in a different interpretation of how to deal with treasury shares and resultantly impacted on the valuation of market capitalisation. This study was undertaken with the aim of establishing if there are differences in the reporting of <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of the number of shares of the company and group as provided by the share analysis section of the annual financial reports which is required by the JSE Listing Requirements. Thirty-four companies were selected specifically, analysed and compared to information as per the University of Stellenbosch Business School share program to determine whether differences arise and to determine the impact that this has on the market capitalisation valuation and explanations for deviations. The results reflected that the non reconciliation of <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of the group was primarily due to the non consolidation of trusts, subsidiaries and treasury shares and companies not adhering to the listing requirements as per section 3. 3 of the shareholders’ spread to adequately disclose treasury related transactions. The study also found ambiguity in accounting standards IAS 1 in that they did not provide conclusive guidance in terms of the disclosure of share movements in rand value and units to reconcile between opening and <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> of all treasury shares. Changes in the tax legislation will in future negate the reason for share repurchases through the subsidiaries or trusts which {{will have an impact on}} the reconciliation process going forward. Ultimately the accounting profession and JSE will have to implement standardised guidelines to ensure that the reporting of treasury shares is simplified to ensure that market users’ understanding of treasury activities and market capitalisation valuation can be improved...|$|R

The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange disclose shareholder spread {{in line with the}} available statutes such as the JSE Listing Requirements. Further, the study explored the <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> for group, company, trusts, subsidiaries, and treasuries of all the 50 companies studied to ascertain whether there were differences with the ex WDH share program. Various sources to answering the question were used including the Internet, McGregor BFA, Annual Reports of the companies, and material from University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB). There were varying findings with regards to the study as it was found that some companies had differences in group, company, trusts, subsidiaries, and treasuries. Most of the differences were due to company mistakes, non-consolidation of trusts, and use of different methods. It was found that certain companies tend to omit certain information in disclosing the shareholder spread and this has resulted in many companies with differences in their <b>closing</b> <b>balances</b> for the company, group, trusts, subsidiaries, and treasuries. In addition, it was also discovered that certain companies disclosed major shareholders of less than the prescribed five percent which proved to be very helpful in this study...|$|R
