5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary <b>existent.</b> He argues that the necessary <b>existent</b> must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary <b>existent.</b> If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary <b>existent</b> itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary <b>existent</b> after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary <b>existent</b> must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary <b>existent,</b> and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary <b>existent</b> while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary <b>existent</b> itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary <b>existent,</b> and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary <b>existent</b> exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary <b>existent</b> must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
50|$|The Attributes of God {{that have}} been {{transferred}} to the <b>existents</b> and have become parts of the mechanism of the universe are collectively known as the Incumbent Knowledge (Ilm-e-wajib).

The Knowledge of the Incumbent {{is also known as}} the Knowledge of the Pen (Ilm-e-Qalum).|$|R

5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary <b>existent.</b> The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary <b>existent.</b> It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an <b>existent</b> creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary <b>existent.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Philosopher Leonard Peikoff, in {{his essay}} [...] "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy", expands upon Rand's analysis. He posits that:The theory of the analytic-synthetic {{dichotomy}} presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about <b>existents,</b> it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by {{an appeal to the}} meanings of your concepts, then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your percepts, then you cannot be certain of it.To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept? He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept. Applying Rand's theory [...] that a concept is a [...] "mental integration" [...] of similar <b>existents,</b> treated as [...] "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual <b>existents,</b> including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the <b>existents</b> — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between [...] "necessary" [...] and [...] "contingent" [...] facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data. Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.|$|R
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the <b>existent</b> literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known <b>existent</b> written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Varaha {{images are}} found in Mathura, dating to the 1st and 2nd century CE. The cult of Varaha {{seems to have been}} popular in the Gupta era (4th-6th century) in Central India, considering the large number of Varaha sculptures and inscriptions found. A red sandstone sculpture of Varaha in boar form with an inscription is traced to the reign of Toramana (late 5th to early 6th century CE). Early sculptures of Varaha generally depict him in his boar form. Anthropomorphic depictions of Varaha with human body and boar’s head become popular in the later period. Other early sculptures exist in the cave temples in Badami in Karnataka (6th century) and Varaha Cave Temple in Mahabalipuram (7th century); both in South India and Ellora Caves (7th century) in Western India. In the Udayagiri Caves (Cave 5) in Madhya Pradesh, an image of Varaha rescuing the earth sculpted in sandstone (dated to 401-450 CE) is seen; and a zoomoriphic image from 8th century from Bago-Pathari is now with the Archeological Museum at Gwalior.
