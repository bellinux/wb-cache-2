5|$|As president-elect, Taylor kept <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command {{until late}} January 1849. He spent the months {{following}} the election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E

5|$|As President, Taylor kept <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> from Congress and his cabinet, even as {{partisan}} tensions {{threatened to}} divide the Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him {{to believe that the}} convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know {{him as a man}} that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E

5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at Â£3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept <b>his</b> <b>distance.</b> He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E

5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> vision and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli {{struck her}} colors to {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli to veer off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept <b>his</b> <b>distance,</b> and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to a sinking condition. With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's tactics were {{successful}} in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to write for the Sydney Sun. A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to write for the Telegraph Pictorial, although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened {{to withdraw from the}} team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while playing together for New South Wales, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept <b>his</b> <b>distance</b> after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman, which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.|$|E

Jim reveals that he has cancer and Susan supports him during his treatments. Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim does not answer her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep <b>his</b> <b>distance,</b> which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices the map and leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries to take him out of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral. On her return, Susan and Karl announce that they are separating. Malcolm initially blames Susan for the split, but Karl confesses it was his idea. Karl tells Susan that he cannot be just friends with her and he looks for somewhere else to live. Susan starts a book group with Kate and Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey).|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep <b>his</b> <b>distance.</b> It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E
