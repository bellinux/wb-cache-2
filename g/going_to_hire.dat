500|$|His {{first big}} break, however, came {{with his second}} Broadway part in The Royal Hunt of the Sun, a play by Peter Shaffer about the {{destruction}} of the Inca empire by conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He said of this performance, [...] "Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> me was in that audience and had his mind blown." [...] For that part, Carradine won a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance in 1965.|$|E
500|$|At first, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a [...] "quintessentially American person" [...] {{to play the role of}} House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a misspent youth [...] too much TV and too many movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E

When Murphy had the role, Zeddemore was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hired</b> much earlier in the film, and would {{accompany}} the trio on their hunt for Slimer at the hotel and be [...] "slimed" [...] in place of Venkman. When Ernie Hudson took over, it was decided that he be brought in later to indicate how the Ghostbusters were struggling {{to keep up with the}} outbreak of ghosts.|$|R
2500|$|Who was fired: Shane, for admitting in the {{boardroom}} that his chances of winning the competition were [...] "infinitely further away" [...] than he thought and for believing that Bill was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> him, which led to Bill firing him for lack of commitment to the competition.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2011, Larry Harvey {{announced}} that the LLC was beginning a three-year process to transfer ownership {{and control of the}} event over to a new non-profit organization called the [...] "Burning Man Project." [...] The move towards becoming a non-profit organization was the result of [...] "bitter infighting" [...] between members of the board. [...] At one point it looked like all of the board members were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> lawyers. [...] Corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth, which Larry Harvey found [...] "abhorrent" [...] and against all of the values that Burning Man stood for.|$|E

Michael then warms up to Erin, telling her she is doing a good job and asking about her future plans. He then relates to her that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> work in the warehouse, but Michael saw [...] "something" [...] in him and made him their new accountant instead; the two drive on singing happily.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 {{the strike}} {{began when the}} ILA’s {{contract}} with the employers of the longshoremen ended, and the employers told their employees {{that they would be}} taking charge of who they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hiring.</b> This meant that the employer could hire nonunion workers before union members, and would make it difficult for the 250 union members to get employment from their former bosses. The ILA members walked out on strike, closing the Port of Portland for a week, but the employers brought in strike breakers, who slept on a ship in order to avoid crossing the picket line.|$|R

2500|$|For the final, {{multiple}} endings are filmed for the finalists {{who make}} it {{to the end of the}} competition, yet Alan Sugar does not reveal his decision about whom he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> until shortly before transmission, which determines which ending is shown as part of the series finale's final edit. Notably, the BBC released two statements in regards to the decision procedure, that are considered to be contradictory against each other; while the first states that Sugar makes his decision on the day that the final boardroom sequence is filmed, based on the contestants' performance in the final task, and keeps it secret until just before transmission, the second states that he decides after a six-month trial period. Former candidate, Saira Khan, notably stated that his final decision [...] "is not based on the programme that people see", but is based on [...] "these two people [...] have been working with him for the six months." ...|$|E

5000|$|His {{relative}} obscurity {{was held}} against {{him during the}} Plot; informers like Stephen Dugdale cunningly invented quite plausible speeches in which he lamented the King's ingratitude {{and the lack of}} reward the Howards had received for their loyalty. In fact Stafford, like his fellow Plot victim John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse, thought that under the tolerant regime of Charles II, the Catholic nobility were as well off as they could reasonably expect to be; at his trial he maintained that he had always argued that [...] "we (i.e the Catholic peers) have no other interest than to be quiet". For example, it was well-known to the authorities that the Catholic mass was regularly celebrated at his London town house, but no action was taken against him as a result.He was frequently abroad: his visits to Paris in the late 1670s, though apparently quite innocent, were later to have fatal results, when he was accused by the informer Edward Turberville of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Paris <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> a killer <b>to</b> assassinate Charles II. Stafford for his part denied that he had ever seen Turberville in his life.|$|R
40|$|Listing {{shares in}} liquid {{secondary}} markets either to facilitate acquisitions or to diversify owner's personal wealth {{are among the}} most important reasons for firms to go public [Brau, J. C., Fawcett, S. E., 2006. Initial public offerings: An analysis of theory and practice. Journal of Finance 61, 399 - 436]. We contend that the expected benefits derived from the liquidity provided by secondary markets are relevant for understanding important decisions made in preparation for an IPO. We hypothesize that the potential losses caused by an IPO failure induce firms that benefit more from <b>going</b> public <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> more reputable underwriters and to adopt more conservative pricing policies. We use several proxies for the benefits firms derive from post-IPO liquidity. The results indicate that firms that benefited more from liquidity were taken public by more prestigious underwriters and exhibited substantially larger levels of price revisions and underpricing. Post-IPO liquidity is also important for understanding the decision to retain the lead underwriter in subsequent SEOs. IPO Liquidity...|$|R

5000|$|O’Connell was not classically {{trained as}} a chef. His {{training}} began at fifteen when he worked after school at a neighborhood restaurant in his native Washington D.C. [...] Along with his now former business and romantic partner, Reinhardt Lynch, he began a catering business in 1972 in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1978, O'Connell and Lynch opened the Inn at Little Washington in an abandoned gas station. Opening first for friends and acquaintances on January 28, 1978, then officially to the public on February 1, 1978, the Inn at Little Washington was met with immediate success and notoriety despite antagonism from many locals. Three weeks after opening, a food critic for the Washington Star, a Washington D.C. newspaper, John Rosson, visited the Inn for dinner after the insistence {{of one of his}} loyal readers. Familiar with Rappahannock County, Rosson accepted the challenge to visit the new restaurant in the sleepy town of Washington, VA, located 67 miles west of the younger but more recognizable Washington D.C. Upon visiting for the first time, he was amazed by what he experienced. To be certain that it {{was more than just a}} [...] "fluke" [...] or a [...] "series of fortunate events," [...] Rosson would return the next week. Upon doing so, equally astonished by the depth and breadth of his experience, he thought it best to introduce himself, despite regarding his anonymity as a food writer as a well-guarded secret. The critic had met his match at least in terms of his ability of uncovering any weak underside of a fledgling new entity, especially one centered in the midst of a sparsely populated village of less than 300 residents. By introducing himself to the new chef and proprietor, he gave a not-so-subtle warning that was more prophetic than conciliatory: [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write a story about you that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change your life. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> need <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> someone full time just to answer your phone!" ...|$|R
50|$|Through avarice Perseus {{also lost}} a chance <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> Gallic mercenaries. A body on {{infantry}} and cavalry of Gauls {{who lived in}} the Balkans offered its services to Perseus for money. Perseus went to one of his camps {{with a small amount of}} gold to give to a few of the men hoping that this would entice the others. He got an envoy to tell the Gauls to move their camp to a place near Macedon. The Gaul asked whether the gold had been brought. There was no reply and they said that they would not move unless they received the gold. Perseus gave his officers the excuse that the Gauls were savages and would hire only 5,000 cavalry which were enough for war and not too many to be dangerous to justify not wanting to spend money on the whole of the Gallic body. When the Gauls heard that only 5,000 cavalry and no infantry were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hired,</b> the rest of their army was disgruntled. The Gallic chieftain asked whether the 5,000 men would receive the agreed pay. There was an evasive answer. The Gauls left, devastating the part of Thrace they went through. Livy thought that this large force of effective fighters could have been used effectively in combined operations with the forces of Perseus which could have put the Romans in an untenable position.|$|R
