This presentation examines the reflective practice {{of a group of}} Chinese EFL secondary teachers about cultivating learner autonomy {{in the context of an}} innovative school project. Two questions are addressed: In what ways was learner/teacher control supported in the context? And what reflections did the teachers <b>demonstrate</b> <b>regarding</b> their autonomy-oriented practice? Data were collected by classroom observations, one-on-one post-lesson discussions, collective discussions among the teachers themselves, and wrap-up interviews. Findings revealed that both students and teachers were allowed to take control over some aspects of their learning and teaching. However, opportunities for reflection were insufficient, particularly on the nature of autonomy and the implementation of strategies for effective control shift.

40|$|Interest {{has been}} {{expressed}} {{in having a}} review {{of some of the}} research on the Relationship Enhancement (RE) model that has been conducted over the years. In this brief review, I will focus on three studies that I think are particularly illuminating because of what they <b>demonstrate</b> <b>regarding</b> RE’s long-term effectiveness. The first two studies involve mother-daughter dyads, while the third study involves couples. In the first study (Guerney, Coufal, & Vogelsong, 1981), mother and daughter pairs were assigned to a no-treatment group, a structured RE therapy treatment group, or a “Traditional Treatment ” (TT) group involving unstructured open communication about roles, feelings and desired behaviors. Participants in the no-treatment group showed virtually no improvement while the TT group participants showed improvement only in the general quality of their relationships. By contrast, participants in the structured RE therapy group showed significant gains in all areas measured: empathy, expressive skill, general communication patterns, and the general quality of their relationships. This study lends some indirect support to the supposition that the structured nature of the RE skills-training model is one factor contributing to its outcome effectiveness. In a follow-up to the previous study (Guerney, Vogelsong & Coufal, 1983), the researcher...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transport}} has large potentialities {{to unveil}} new physics in mesoscopic systems. A striking illustration is the integer quantum Hall regime, where the robustness of Hall currents limits information accessible from charge transport. Consequently, the gapless edge excitations are incompletely understood. The effective edge states theory describes them as prototypal one-dimensional chiral fermions - a simple picture that explains {{a large body}} of observations and calls for quantum information experiments with quantum point contacts in the role of beam splitters. However, it is in ostensible disagreement with the prevailing theoretical framework that predicts, in most situations, additional gapless edge modes. Here, we present a setup which gives access to the energy distribution, and consequently to the energy current, in an edge channel brought out-of-equilibrium. This provides a stringent test of whether the additional states capture part of the injected energy. Our results show it is not the case and thereby <b>demonstrate</b> <b>regarding</b> energy transport, the quantum optics analogy of quantum point contacts and beam splitters. Beyond the quantum Hall regime, this novel spectroscopy technique opens a new window for heat transport and out-of-equilibrium experiments.

This presentation examines the reflective practice {{of a group of}} Chinese EFL secondary teachers about cultivating learner autonomy {{in the context of an}} innovative school project. Two questions are addressed: In what ways was learner/teacher control supported in the context? And what reflections did the teachers <b>demonstrate</b> <b>regarding</b> their autonomy-oriented practice? The participants comprised the school principal, the executive director, and all nine teachers in the English Department. Taking an interpretive naturalistic paradigm, this case study deployed a multi-method approach to data collection, conducted over an academic semester of five months. Data gathered included twenty two classroom observations, fourteen post-lesson discussion sessions, eleven interviews, and numerous field and reflective notes, school documents and classroom materials. The collected data were subjected to a process of grounded analysis, through which important themes were identified by open and axial coding, constant comparison and contrast and iterative checking. Major findings were summarised into two points. On the part of students, while opportunities to take control were allowed in such activities as pre-lesson presentations, collaborative group work, and peer teaching, few opportunities were observed for students to reflect on their learning and rationalise their participation in these activities. On the part of the teachers, whereas reflective sessions were running weekly in the form of collective post-lesson discussions, the range of topics covered in the discussions was too wide to permit focussed reflection. The study implies that teachers need to develop students’ awareness of and ability for reflective learning, and that school managers should guide and support teachers to conduct more purposeful LA-oriented reflective teaching...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the Harry Potter series, J. K. Rowling employs {{traditional}} gendered thinking in her construction of character roles, but as the series continues, the gender roles are complicated. In the three main communities of J. K. Rowling’s world – the Ministry, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the societies of the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix – a struggle between the constructive, equalizing force of white magic and the violent, dominating force of black magic influences the gender roles operative in each. As a vehicle for the exercise of magic, the nuclear family also influences wizarding society in similarly bipolar ways, perpetuating patriarchal ideas while simultaneously encouraging the power of motherhood and maternal love. One sees the patriarchal impact of the family paradigm on the novel’s central female character Hermione Granger, who defies gender norms in her adeptness in white magic and her heroic partnership with Harry himself, but who ultimately dwindles into a stereotypically feminine role as Ron’s wife in the series epilogue. My analysis will focus on Rowling’s fictions rather than her adaptations and I use primarily gender and feminist critical lenses in a close textual reading. As a feminist critic, I will examine how J. K. Rowling’s wizarding world in the Harry Potter series handles the binary of black and white magic and the gender inclusiveness of both forms of magic in their relative spheres. I focus on the novels themselves rather than on J. K. Rowling’s intentionality and will not rely on much of the post-publication digital interplay Rowling and others have conducted to prevent any digression on my part into how fanbase bias may have influenced plot choices and character development. For that reason, I limit my use of the informational site Pottermore. com to relevant historical 2 details and post-series character additions. My focus remains on the published volumes themselves and what they <b>demonstrate</b> <b>regarding</b> the gender dynamics that unfold across the series. The gender dynamics present within the Harry Potter series are complex and dynamic, creating a world rife with possibilities for readers and for the characters themselves. Rowling writes several female characters who embody the Manichean struggle between the inclusive power of white magic and the hierarchical, dominating force of black magic. Through these women, Rowling attempts to collapse the binary between female and male traits and create a society free of polarizing gendered stereotypes, and through such women as Molly Weasley, Minerva McGonagall, and Hermione Granger, she succeeds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{technique}} that reduces stacking fault (SF) density in 3 C-SiC, termed switch-back epitaxy (SBE), is <b>demonstrated</b> <b>regarding</b> {{its effects on}} morphological and electrical properties. SBE is a homoepitaxial growth process on backside of 3 C-SiC grown on undulant-Si. The key feature of SBE, the surface polarity of residual SFs in 3 C-SiC, which cannot be erased by heteroepitaxial growth on undulant-Si, is converted from the Si-face to the C-face. The SF density {{on the surface of}} 3 C-SiC grown by SBE shows a remarkable decrease to one-seventh lower than that on undulant- Si. The leakage current of pn-diode epitaxially fabricated on the 3 C-SiC substrate grown by SBE decreases to as low as one-thirtieth that on 3 C-SiC substrate grown without SBE. These results suggest that SBE eliminates the SFs on the surface of 3 C-SiC and subsequently reduces the leakage current at pn-junction thus fabricated...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} moving grid technique is proposed for computing unsteady flow problems with geometrical deformation, relative body movement or shape changes due to aerodynamic optimisation and fluid-structure interaction. A Delaunay graph {{of the solution}} domain is first generated, which can be moved easily during the geometric dynamic deformation, even for very large distortion. A one to one mapping between the Delaunay graph and the computational grid is maintained during the movement.

While most dynamic grid deformation techniques are iterative based on the spring analogy, the present method is non-iterative and much more efficient. On the other hand, in comparison with dynamic grid techniques based on transfinite interpolation for structured grids, it offers both geometric and cell topology flexibility, which is crucial for many unsteady flow problems involving geometric deformation and relative motions.
