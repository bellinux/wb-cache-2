50|$|Monmouth Troy <b>Goods</b> <b>Yard</b> {{was a large}} <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> near Monmouth Troy {{railway station}} in Monmouth, Wales. It was opened in 1857 by the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway {{at the same time}} as the station. As other {{railways}} reached Monmouth Troy the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> grew in importance. At its height, the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> was used by the Wye Valley Railway, Coleford Railway, Ross and Monmouth Railway as well as the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway. The <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> closed in 1964 when the last two railways, the former Wye Valley Railway and Ross and Monmouth Railway, closed. The non-rail depot remained open until October 1964.|$|R
50|$|The station {{once had}} a small <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> on the {{northern}} side of the main line, the bay platform for which still exists although {{it is no longer}} in use.

50|$|A <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> was {{developed}} {{on the site}} of the first station. Its turntable is now in the possession of the West Somerset Railway. The Great Western Railway (GWR) doubled the track between Pwllheli station and the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> in order to increase capacity. But after the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> was closed and both the signal boxes and the signals were removed in 1977, the double-lined section is now used as a long run-round loop for visiting charter trains. By 1987 a supermarket had been developed on the former <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> land.|$|R
50|$|To {{cope with}} the {{production}} from the mills the station had a vast <b>goods</b> <b>yard.</b> The whole station and <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> site has now been incorporated into the Travis Perkins builders merchants which occupies the site. Just beyond the station was the GN Goods Junction where the GN trains linked with the Oxenhope branch for the last mile into Keighley.

The site of the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> now has a Co-operative supermarket. Access to the yard was {{operated}} by a small signal box with a 24-lever frame, which was used until 25 June 1969. The signal box was situated {{at the southern end}} of the Bidston-bound platform.|$|R
50|$|Piacenza has a <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> {{consisting}} of 13 tracks, numbered 9 to 22. The <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> {{is equipped with}} a goods shed that is still active. Some abandoned tracks in the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> will be dismantled {{to make way for the}} mini-Piacenza highway under construction north of the town. The highway will connect the southern part of the city, via Diete di Roncaglia, with central Milan, and from there with the bridge over the Po river.|$|R
50|$|The <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> is {{distinctly}} {{separated from}} the passenger station and {{is linked to the}} incoming lines by two lines connected in a triangle, starting {{from one end of the}} passenger station. This allows the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> to receive <b>goods</b> trains without having to occupy sections of line reserved for passenger services. At the end of the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> is the Centro Intermodale Merci (CIM), built at the turn of the twenty-first century, while along the track north of the triangle is the new Novara Nord railway station. Finally, the <b>goods</b> <b>yard</b> is linked with the Treno Alta Velocit√† (TAV) by a couple of tracks that are bypassed by the FNM line to Novara Nord.|$|R

50|$|It is all {{set up for}} {{a tragic}} conclusion, but {{suddenly}} Ibsen pulls back from the brink. The <b>yard</b> <b>foreman</b> gets an attack of conscience and rows out to stop the Indian Girl from heading to sea and death; Bernick's son is brought back safely by his mother; and Bernick addresses the community, tells them most of the truth and gets away with it. His wife greets the news that he only married her for money as a sign there is now hope for their marriage.|$|R
