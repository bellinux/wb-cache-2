50|$|Hour wheel - which {{fits over}} {{the shaft of}} the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> and whose shaft holds the hour hand. The hour wheel rotates once for every 12 {{rotations}} of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour â€” this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b> The <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|R

50|$|Minute wheel - Its pinion {{drives the}} hour wheel. During setting, this {{is driven by}} the {{intermediate}} wheel in the keyless work and it turns both the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> and the hour wheel, moving the hands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the minute wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> directly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motion work}} is the small 12-to-1 {{reduction}} gear train that turns the timepiece's hour hand from the minute hand. [...] It {{is attached to the}} going train by the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> so the minute and hour hands can be turned independently to set the timepiece. It is often located {{on the outside of the}} movement's front plate, just under the dial. It consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has a gear called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the ratchet teeth, preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel engage with a gear which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> allows the hands to be rotated.|$|R
5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring barrels coupled {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin balance staff. Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion).</b> Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|R
2500|$|AT-TEs are {{depicted}} as assault vehicles that {{appear at the}} Battle of Geonosis, as depicted in Attack of the Clones and various Clone Wars media. It has magnetic feet, which allows it to scale steep embankments if they are magnetic, like the mesa on Teth in [...] The low profile, six legs and overall flexibility made it vulnerable to IEDs and reduced its acceleration and maximum speed, but increased its center of gravity, traverse speed, mobility and stability; moreover, its low speed allows it to walk through energy shields. The vehicles are fixed with laser turrets, a powerful mass <b>driver</b> <b>cannon,</b> and heavy electromagnetic armor. AT-TEs are manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering, a subdivision of Kuat Drive Yards (who manufacture {{many of the other}} walkers). AT-TEs have the distinct tactical advantage, common among many of the Old Republic's larger walkers, of being able to be carried into combat by LAAT/C dropships. This allows their swift deployment to the battlefront from distant landing zones and ground bases.|$|R
50|$|Dragonar {{takes place}} in the year 2087 AD, when a {{military}} force called the United Lunar Empire Gigano has risen and captured the Moon. Their stated goal is the rebirth of mankind, but their primary intention by some of its members is the destruction of all those who dwell on Earth. To this end, the Empire uses humanoid battle machines called Metal Armors, as well as a gigantic mass <b>driver</b> <b>cannon.</b> Originally intended to send lunar material to Earth orbit for later retrieval, the Mass driver is reconfigured to launch small meteorites towards the home world. By the time the story takes place many bombardments have already taken place. The Earth Alliance became Earth Federation military, unable to compete with the Giganos military might, manages to steal three prototype Metal Armors with plans to reverse-engineer them with the help of exiled Giganos scientists. However, the ship carrying the Dragonars (posing as a refugee ship) is chased to a neutral colony by Giganos, and an attack is staged to retrieve them. Kaine, Tapp and Light, three friends and EFM trainees, are on the colony during the attack, and find a dying Giganos spy who gives them three disks. Chased by Giganos' weapons, the trio enters the colony's dock and finds the Dragonars. Using the disks, they activate the machines and use them to protect the colony. However, since the Dragonars are keyed to only be operable by their initial user, the three friends find themselves forced to become the Earth Federation military's first Metal Armor pilots, faced against the advanced technology and veterans of the Giganos forces.|$|R
50|$|The estate's reconstructed {{carriage}} house displays the vintage vehicles that Martha Berry used {{until her death}} in 1942. She rode the carriages and cars but she never drove these cars so male student <b>drivers</b> and Geddins <b>Cannon,</b> the grounds director, drove her from place to place. Inside the {{carriage house}} are the Berry buggy, a 1914 Ford touring car, a 1917 Ford Model-T, a 1940 Mercury and a Fordson tractor. The 1940 Mercury is the last car that Martha rode in before she died.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the output}} of the {{committees}} have been lost but where they still exist there is a clear link to the new regulations and manuals that started to be issued in 1921. By 1923, the major outputs of this work were completed and the results show up in new manuals issued from that time which demonstrate a high level of tactical thought. Experience from World War I was incorporated as seen in the new infantry regulation of October 1922 where 10-12 squads included a light machine gun with the rifle section and fluid fire-and-manoeuvre stormtroop tactics are endorsed. It is also {{important to note that the}} manuals do not limit themselves to the armaments allowed by the Versailles Treaty envisaging tactics using forbidden infantry cannons for example. It is here that we see explicit strategic capabilities being built into the new unified doctrines, so such things as cross-training requirements being built into regulations; e.g. transport troops being required to train a set number of wagon <b>drivers</b> as <b>cannon</b> gunners and as engineers specialising in bridges.|$|R
5000|$|The SCCA Chasing the Dragon hillclimb on the 2.3 mi course up the Maple Gap Road in Nantahala Forests, North Carolina is held twice {{each year}} near the Joyce Kilmer National Forests, first run in 2011. The hillclimb {{was founded by}} Ted Theodore, Cheri Brantley and Darryl [...] "killboy" [...] <b>Cannon.</b> <b>Drivers</b> compete for cash and prizes in vintage, production, open wheel and special classes. Fastest King and Queen get a Dragonslayer sword. Current Record holder is Allen Skillicorn in a Legrande. Current fastest female is Vicki Eckerich in a {{prepared}} Mini Cooper. Five time King of the Hill, Heikki Rinta-Koski competes in a Miata engined, turbo-charged Locost 7. Admissions is free for spectators and safe viewing areas are found on the hill.|$|R
