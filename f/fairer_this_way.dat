60|$|First of all then, let the House {{consider}} carefully {{whether from}} these sources {{it is possible}} to overtake the 10 per cent. reduction which, in the first instance, the Bill imposes. It is a question nicely balanced; it offers matter for <b>fair</b> argument <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and that, but, taking all the means of mitigation together, not only singly but collectively, it is surely very difficult to believe that masters and men, organised as they are, and working together with good will, and with ample time to accommodate themselves to new arrangements, will not be able from all sources to overtake the comparatively small reduction in hours the Bill will effect.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{following}} multiagent {{variant of the}} knapsack problem. We are given a set of items, a set of voters, and a value of the budget; each item is endowed with a cost and each voter assigns to each item a certain value. The goal is to select a subset of items with the total cost not exceeding the budget, {{in a way that}} is consistent with the voters' preferences. Since the preferences of the voters over the items can vary significantly, we need a way of aggregating these preferences, in order to select the socially most preferred valid knapsack. We study three approaches to aggregating voters preferences, which are motivated by the literature on multiwinner elections and <b>fair</b> allocation. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> we introduce the concepts of individually best, diverse, and fair knapsack. We study computational complexity (including parameterized complexity, and complexity under restricted domains) of computing the aforementioned concepts of multiagent knapsacks...|$|R

40|$|Fairness in {{multihop}} ad hoc networks {{has received}} considerable {{attention in the}} literature. Many schemes have been proposed, which attempt to compute the “optimal”bit rates of the transmitting mobile nodes so that a certain fairness criterion is met. As the related literature indicates, there is a trade-off between fairness and efficiency, since fairness schemes typically reduce the channel utilization. Also, it is questionable whether certain fairness schemes have a positive or {{negative impact on the}} QoS of certain user services. So far, there has been limited research on the impact of the varying short-term allocations of these protocols, due to their inherent features and also nodes mobility, on the user-perceived QoS (and social welfare) for services of long duration. In this paper, we introduce an assessment framework, based on history-dependent utility functions that {{can be used as a}} holistic performance evaluation tool of these fairness schemes. These functions quantify the satisfaction that the ad hoc users obtain from the way their long-lived service sessions are allocated bandwidth, due to the behavior of the MANETs <b>fair</b> schemes. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> we can unambiguously compare the performance of various fair solutions whose maximization goals are inherently different (max-min fairness, proportional fairness, etc.). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it on different protocols...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{contributes}} to the research agenda of studies on accounting measurement by suggesting that incremental change {{is taking place in}} IFRS which has the effect of moving recognition of assets and liabilities to an earlier point in the transaction cycle. This is manifested in recognition of executory contracts and changes in economic state in some standards. The professional debate about fair value obscures the underlying boundary shift. Fair value is used to simulate completion of the transaction cycle. The use of <b>fair</b> value in <b>this</b> <b>way</b> is accompanied by a change in emphasis as to how reliability should be construed, with representational faithfulness being advanced over verifiability. The recognition of income and expense earlier in the cycle is corrected on final realisation, so the overall profits or losses of the entity are not changed, although recognition may lake place in different periods than under historical cost...|$|R
40|$|In 1939, the United States was {{the site}} of two major expositions: one was the famous New York Fair, while the other was the Golden Gate International Exposition, held on the West Coast. The latter fair was {{originally}} designed as a celebration of modern development of transportation and communication, but later the founding fathers of it chose to shift their attention towards the Pacific. Thus they employed a slogan 'A Pageant of the Pacific'and, as a result, the representation of the Pacific cultures (the cultures of the Asia-Pacific region in their understanding) became the crucial feature of the <b>fair.</b> In <b>this</b> paper, I focus on this rather 'minor'fair and explore how the Pacific region cultures were perceived and interpreted {{in the context of the}} slogan 'A Pageant of the Pacific. 'Firstly I examine the philosophy behind this slogan and reveal how it advocated cross-cultural communication between American fairgoers and Pacific peoples. Secondly, I describe the form taken by these exhibitions of the Pacific cultures and point out how deeply they were influenced by a scientific perspective. By focusing on the <b>fair's</b> framework in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> I will ultimately reveal how and why these exhibits ed to a distorted view of the Pacific region...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem where the agent {{receives}} a vectorial feedback that encodes many possibly competing objectives to be optimized. The {{goal of the}} agent {{is to find a}} policy, which can optimize these objectives simultaneously in a <b>fair</b> <b>way.</b> <b>This</b> multi-objective online optimization problem is formalized by using the Generalized Gini Index (GGI) aggregation function. We propose an online gradient descent algorithm which exploits the convexity of the GGI aggregation function, and controls the exploration in a careful way achieving a distribution-free regret (T^- 1 / 2) with high probability. We test our algorithm on synthetic data as well as on an electric battery control problem where the goal is to trade off the use of the different cells of a battery in order to balance their respective degradation rates.

40|$|Around Australia {{there are}} several aspects of the electoral system which are {{currently}} under review. The main areas are how the electoral system can best include all eligible voters at election times (this debate is about direct enrolment, disability access, online voting and postal voting); how elections can be conducted in a <b>fair</b> <b>way</b> (<b>this</b> debate includes regulation of electoral advertising and political comment at election times) and how the election can be regulated so that parties have a fair chance of competing (this debate is currently about public funding of campaigns and legislating for disclosure of contributions and expenditures). The Electoral (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 2012 proposes change in several of these areas. It addresses the inclusiveness of the electoral process with two proposals: one, to allow the Commonwealth's new direct enrolment and update system to flow on to update South Australia's roll; and two, to change the arrangements for postal voting, removing parties from the postal vote application process. The Bill addresses election conduct by proposing to remove a requirement that political comment on the internet carry an authorisation statement. It also proposes to regulate How To Vote cards by introducing a registration system and requiring clearer authorisation statements. It leaves for another time the debate about campaign funding and disclosure.
