5000|$|Blowdown {{turbines}} became relatively {{common features}} in the late- and post-war era, especially for engines designed for long overwater flights. Turbo-compounding was used on several airplane engines after World War II, including the Napier Nomad and the Wright R-3350 being examples. The exhaust restriction imparted by the three blowdown turbines used on the Wright R-3350 is equal to a well-designed <b>jet</b> <b>stack</b> system used on a conventional radial engine, while recovering about [...] at METO (maximum continuous except for take-off) power. In {{the case of the}} R-3350, maintenance crews sometimes nicknamed the turbine the parts recovery turbine due to its negative effect on engine reliability. Turbo-compound versions of the Napier Deltic, Rolls-Royce Crecy, Rolls-Royce Griffon, and Allison V-1710 were constructed but none was developed beyond the prototype stage. It was realized in many cases the power produced by the simple turbine was approaching that of the enormously complex and maintenance-intensive piston engine to which it was attached. As a result, turbo-compound aero engines were soon supplanted by turboprop and turbojet engines.|$|E
50|$|In early 1947, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation {{unveiled}} the L-749, a derivative of its L-649 Constellation with fuel tanks {{to increase its}} range by 1000 mi. Due to the increased weight, the landing gear and tires had to be strengthened. <b>Jet</b> <b>stacks</b> were also introduced, increasing speed by 15 mph. These <b>jet</b> <b>stacks</b> increased the noise, requiring more insulation. As with the L-649, ten different layouts of the internal cabin were possible. Airlines originally attracted to the L-649 changed their orders to the L-749. The L-749 was to become the standard version of the regular Constellation.|$|R
40|$|Middepth current {{measurements}} in {{the equatorial}} Atlantic {{are characterized by}} elevated levels of energy contained in zonal flows of high baroclinic mode number. These alternating zonal flows, often called equatorial <b>stacked</b> <b>jets,</b> have amplitudes up to 20 cm s-(1) and vertical wavelengths of 600 m. The jets are most pronounced in the depth range between 500 and 2500 m. Repeated direct velocity observations at 35 degrees W indicate that the jets are coherent within +/- 1 degrees of the equator. Individual jets can persist for 1 - 2 years, but they appear and decay rather irregularly. The equatorial <b>stacked</b> <b>jets</b> are also found in realistic general circulation model simulations. The features grow in amplitude with increasing horizontal and vertical model resolution. However, even at very high model resolutions, their amplitudes are still underestimated. In all model simulations, high levels of energy related to the <b>stacked</b> <b>jets</b> {{are found in the}} vicinity of the western boundary currents (WBCs). Depth range and strength of the WBCs in different experiments are related to depth range and strength of the jets. In the interior, <b>stacked</b> <b>jets</b> are characterized by eastward wave propagation suggesting that high baroclinic mode Kelvin waves radiate energy generated in the WBC into the interior and form the <b>stacked</b> <b>jets...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{idea was}} relaunched after a rival {{aircraft}} appeared, when Douglas launched a stretched {{version of its}} DC-6 airliner as a cargo transport, designated DC-6A, for both military and civilian operators. Douglas was soon to launch a passenger version (the DC-6B) of this new aircraft. The DC-6B could carry 23 more passengers than Lockheed's current production L-749 Constellation.In 1950 Lockheed had repurchased the XC-69 Constellation prototype from the Hughes Tool Company. The XC-69 however, was equipped with four Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engines instead of the Wright R-3350s used on production models (Lockheed had made that installation on the prototype to test the R-2800 as a possible engine option for the L-049). Lockheed lengthened XC-69 by 18 feet (5.5 m), to become {{the basis for the}} L-1049 Super Constellation. The aircraft first flew later that year still fitted with R-2800 engines, then was refitted with R-3350 956-C18CA-1 engines with <b>jet</b> <b>stacks</b> for slightly increased thrust. Later modifications included strengthened landing gear and larger vertical stabilizers. Eastern Air Lines ordered 10 aircraft, while Trans World Airlines (TWA) followed with an order for 14. The L-1049 had some 550 improvements and modifications compared to the L-749, including greater fuel capacity, rectangular windows, larger cockpit windshields and improved heating and pressurization.|$|R

40|$|High spatial- and temporal-resolution {{images of}} coronal hole regions show a {{dynamical}} environment where mass flows and jets are frequently observed. These jets {{are believed to}} be important for the coronal heating and the acceleration of the fast solar wind. We studied the dynamics of two jets seen in a polar coronal hole with a combination of imaging from EIS and XRT onboard Hinode. We observed drift motions related to the evolution and formation of these small-scale jets, which we tried to model as well. We found observational evidence that supports the idea that polar jets are very likely produced by multiple small-scale reconnections occurring at different times in different locations. These eject plasma blobs that flow up and down with a motion very similar to a simple ballistic motion. The associated drift speed of the first jet is estimated to be ≈ 27 km s^- 1. The average outward speed of the first jet is ≈ 171 km s^- 1, well below the escape speed, hence if simple ballistic motion is considered, the plasma will not escape the Sun. The second jet was observed in the south polar coronal hole with three XRT filters, namely, C_-poly, Al_-poly, and Al_-mesh filters. We observed that the second jet drifted at all altitudes along the jet with the same drift speed of ≃ 7 km s^- 1. The enhancement in the light curves of low-temperature EIS lines in the later phase of the jet lifetime and the shape of the <b>jet's</b> <b>stack</b> plots suggests that the jet material is falls back, and most likely cools down. To support this conclusion, the observed drifts were interpreted within a scenario where reconnection progressively shifts along a magnetic structure, leading to the sequential appearance of jets of about the same size and physical characteristics. On this basis, we also propose a simple qualitative model that mimics the observations. Comment: Accepted Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
40|$|Rotation {{measures}} (RMs) {{have proven}} to be an excellent tool to study magnetic field structures in AGNs. Here we study RM properties on kiloparsec scales of theM 87 <b>jet</b> via <b>stacked</b> multi wavelength polarized VLA observations. Our results show for the first time an indication of the RM gradient transverse to the jet in knot A, and possibly knot C and HST- 1. Motivated by the shape of the RM in knots A and B, we discuss that part of it may be a filamentary structure of higher RM due to an external Faraday screen, although we consider this unlikely The data presented here can be easily explained by a helical magnetic field. By combining this result together with polarization direction plus the shape and degree of the fractional polarization across the jet, we can fairly conclude the presence of systematically wrapped, possibly helical, magnetic fields tightly wounded in knots A and C, in agreement with an MHD quad shock model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and variability of the zonal equatorial {{flow in the}} Atlantic is studied {{on the basis of}} velocity profiles obtained with lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers during multiple surveys. The vertical extent of the zonal currents is found to vary considerably. It can be as small as 100 m or as large as 1000 m. In the Atlantic, vertical scales of 400 - 600 m have been associated with the equatorial deep jets (they are also frequently called deep <b>jets</b> or <b>stacked</b> <b>jets).</b> Typical amplitudes of the zonal velocity are about 20 cm s(- 1). An analysis of quasi-synoptic surveys indicates that the zonal extent of most jets is likely to be at least 27 &DEG;. They can rise or deepen from west to east, although the deepening was observed more often and is often more pronounced. The west to east deepening can be as large as 320 m/ 10 &DEG;. Basin-wide mean depth changes of the jets are mostly on the order of 50 m/ 10 &DEG;, and the largest depth changes are typically observed between 35 &DEG; and 23 &DEG; W. The existence of these changes indicates that vertically propagating, equatorially trapped, waves might be one cause for the jet structure. However, the dependence of the slope on the longitude indicates that other processes must be involved as well. The typical vertical extent of the jets is small enough to result in several direction changes of the zonal flow in the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) layer. From transport estimates for 14 meridional sections it is found that the transport for the westward component of the flow within the AAIW layer (500 - 1000 m) can be as large as - 24 Sv (1 Sv = 10 (6) M, s(- 1)) within 1 &DEG; of the equator. For the eastward component of the flow in the AAIW layer the transport can be as large as 8 Sv. Adding the transport components for each section results in a range of total AAIW transports from - 24 to 7 Sv. This suggest that the annual mean transport of AAIW is westward. The only months with eastward total transports are June and July. This is consistent with earlier Lagrangian and some other observations that indicated that the AAIW flow along the equator is governed by an annual cycle. In the NADW layer (1200 - 3900 m) the transport for the westward (eastward) flow can be as large as - 25 Sv (23 Sv) within 1 &DEG; of the equator. This results in a range of total NADW transports from - 10 to 18 Sv. The variations of the total transports of AAIW and NADW are anti-correlated, with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 86. Since only eight sections reached deep enough to allow transport estimates in the NADW layer it is more difficult to come to a conclusion about the mean transport in this layer than for the transport in the AAIW layer (for the latter layer 14 sections were available). Nevertheless, the obtained estimates suggest that the total NADW transport may be eastward...|$|R
5000|$|Large {{numbers of}} DC-3s and surplus C-47s were in {{commercial}} {{use in the}} United States in the 1940s. In response to proposed changes to the Civil Air Regulations airworthiness requirements that would limit the continuing use of these aircraft, Douglas offered a late 1940s DC-3 conversion to improve takeoff and single-engined performance. The new model, the DC-3S or [...] "Super DC-3", was 39 in (0.99 m) longer. It allowed 30 passengers to be carried, with increased speed to compete with newer airliners. The rearward shift {{in the center of}} gravity led to larger tail surfaces and new outer, swept-back wings. More powerful engines were installed along with shorter, <b>jet</b> ejection-type exhaust <b>stacks.</b> These were either 1,475 hp (1,100 kW) Wright R-1820 Cyclones or 1,450 hp (1,081 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2000 Twin Wasps in larger engine nacelles. Minor changes included wheel well doors, a partially retractable tailwheel, flush rivets, and low drag antenna. These all contributed to an increased top speed of 250 mph. With greater than 75% of the original DC-3/C-47 configuration changed, the modified design was virtually a new aircraft. The first DC-3S made its maiden flight on 23 June 1949.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEquatorial zonal {{currents}} and associated oxygen distributions are studied using shipboard hydrographic data, trajectories from isopycnic floats drifting at about 300 m depth, and velocity time series {{from the upper}} 1100 m obtained at two equatorial moorings located at 35 degrees W and 23 degrees W. Mean profiles of zonal velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers yielded a westward flowing Equatorial Intermediate Current (EIC) below the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at both locations. The EIC consists of two westward current cores at about 250 and 450 m. The upper core of the EIC deepens by about 30 m from 23 degrees W, where it has a mean velocity of 6 +/- 2 cm s(- 1,) to 35 degrees W, where the mean is 5 +/- 3 cm s(- 1). The lower core of the EIC is about twice as strong with 12 +/- 1 cm s(- 1) at 23 degrees W and 9 +/- 2 cm s(- 1) at 35 degrees W. The flow below the EUC is characterized by substantial interannual variability. From May to December 2005 a strong, zonally coherent eastward jet occurred at 300 to 350 m depth, found to be an expression of shallow <b>stacked</b> <b>jets</b> superimposed on the mean EIC.

40|$|Chandra X-ray {{observations}} of the nearby brightest cluster galaxy M 87 resolve the hot gas structure across the Bondi accretion radius of the central supermassive black hole, a measurement possible in {{only a handful of}} systems but complicated by the bright nucleus and <b>jet</b> emission. By <b>stacking</b> only short frame-time observations to limit pileup, and after subtracting the nuclear PSF, we analysed the X-ray gas properties within the Bondi radius at 0. 12 - 0. 22 kpc (1. 5 - 2. 8 arcsec), depending on the black hole mass. Within 2 kpc radius, we detect two significant temperature components, which are consistent with constant values of 2 keV and 0. 9 keV down to 0. 15 kpc radius. No evidence was found for the expected temperature increase within 0. 25 kpc due to the influence of the SMBH. Within the Bondi radius, the density profile is consistent with ρ∝ r^- 1. The lack of a temperature increase inside the Bondi radius suggests that the hot gas structure is not dictated by the SMBH's potential and, together with the shallow density profile, shows that the classical Bondi rate may not reflect the accretion rate onto the SMBH. If this density profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate onto the SMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which agrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M 87. We discuss the evidence for outflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disk and for cold feedback, where gas cooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disk and fuel the SMBH. At 0. 2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component represents 20...|$|R
