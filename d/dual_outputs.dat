40|$|Multilevel {{inverter}} (MLI) is {{a proven}} technology used for industrial applications due to low output {{total harmonic distortion}} (THD), high power handling capability and low active device rating. <b>Dual</b> <b>output</b> inverter is a recent trend associated with inverter topologies for specialized applications. This paper deals with three phase three level <b>dual</b> input <b>dual</b> <b>output</b> inverter topology with minimum active device count. Reduction in switch count leads to reduction in losses and improves reliability. Both the input sources share power equally as neutral point current ripple is maintained low. For further reduction in switching losses at higher switching frequencies, the concept of “no switching zone” or discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) has been put forth recently. This paper proposes modification in the placement of “no switching zone” in order to optimize switching losses and output THD (output filtering requirements) for low power factor load. This study also proposes novel graphical approach to analyze the loss reduction along with its effect on output THD. The sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is used which gives satisfactory switching loss reduction without complex calculations. Moreover, the proposed topology is generalized to provide <b>dual</b> <b>output</b> at higher voltage levels. It is seen that the components reduction phenomenon becomes more pronounced as number of levels goes on increasing.
