25|$|En route, the {{helicopter}} ran into poor weather and was then struck by lightning. This caused severe {{damage to the}} tail rotor. Though {{the helicopter}} managed to limp for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes,</b> the tail rotor eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency autorotation onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a life raft. Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{right for}} the junks, Canton opened up with her guns {{and by the time}} she was {{receiving}} enemy fire, Hay's ship came within range and engaged. After a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes</b> of accurate fire, Chui A-poo's fleet scattered and three junks were abandoned by their crews, most of whom drowned as their vessels were sunk around them. Towards the end of the engagement, shots from the Columbine hit one of the larger junks and it exploded, sending up a large plume of smoke. Ten junks escaped the battle due to the British who chose not to continue the chase for they had an idea about where the brigands were going. The British had already been at station non-stop for forty hours, another reason for abandoning the pursuit. Chui A-poo's pirates were reported to have suffered 250 casualties and a total of over 200 cannon were destroyed or captured and then taken back to Hong Kong. Three Royal Navy sailors were killed on the Columbine and one officer and six men wounded.|$|E

500|$|After a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes,</b> {{during which}} Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck, the damaged British {{battleship}} withdrew. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened, though Captain Ernst Lindemann, Bismarcks commander, strongly advocated chasing Prince of Wales and destroying her. Lütjens firmly rejected the request, and instead ordered Bismarck and Prinz Eugen {{to head for}} the open waters of the North Atlantic. After the end of the engagement, Lütjens reported that a [...] "Battlecruiser, probably Hood, sunk. Another battleship, King George V or Renown, turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact." [...] At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach Prinz Eugen for commerce raiding and to make for St. Nazaire for repairs. Shortly after 10:00, Lütjens ordered Prinz Eugen to fall behind Bismarck to discern the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming [...] "broad streams of oil on both sides of [...] wake", Prinz Eugen returned to the forward position.|$|E
500|$|Mark's other housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), gets in {{from work}} and realises Mark is leaving because of the {{harassment}} he has received due to exposing the corruption within the police force. Mark admits he is going into witness protection and he and Kyle say their goodbyes. Sophie decides to go with Kate and they hurry to meet Mark. At the meeting point, Mark's boss, Duncan Hayes (Paul Ireland), arrives and asks if Mark is ready. He replies that Kate is on her way, as he hands his wallet and phone over. Sophie struggles {{to keep up with}} her sister and tells her to go to Mark, as they can collect her on the way. Kate continues running, just as [...] it starts to rain. Hayes tells Mark that they need to leave, but Mark asks him to wait for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes.</b> When Kate reaches the meeting point, she finds no one there. Sophie questions whether Mark changed his mind and Kate runs home to Ramsay Street. She enters Mark's house calling his name and then receives a text message saying [...] "I love you", which Mark sent from Hayes' phone. Kyle comforts Kate while she cries about Mark.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, the focus shifted away from a strict sameness of conditions towards equal fairness of conditions. [...] For example, a test taker with a broken wrist might write more slowly because of the injury, and it would be more fair, and produce a more reliable understanding of the test taker's actual knowledge, if that person were given a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes</b> to write down the answers to a most test. [...] However, if the purpose of the test is to see how quickly the student could write, then this would become a modification of the content, and no longer a standardized test.|$|E

2500|$|The {{largest of}} the American ships was Arab of over 380 tons but with a crew of only forty-five men, she was sternmost in line and was {{considered}} to be the most [...] "war like" [...] of the four. Dolphin of 300 tons was headmost and she was Captain Stafford's flagship, carrying ninety-eight men into battle. When the British came within sight of the American line, they first stopped to wait for the wind and the remaining twelve boats to come up so Polkinghorne took the time to rally his men. After a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes</b> the wind was still calm so the lieutenant ordered an attack in order to deny the Americans time to prepare defenses or escape. Polkinghorne sent a boat with the 12-pounder forward to commence an artillery duel with the intention of delaying the Americans but this failed when Stafford's ships all opened fire with a combined broadside. Lieutenant Polkinghorne decided to stop waiting at this point and he led his boats directly for the center two American ships, Racer and Lynx, each of 280 tons and with crews totaling seventy-six men. As the British closed range the Americans fired another broadside so Polkinghorne had his men alter course and head for Arab. When the British boats drew near there were three left, two having been hit and sunk by American fire.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the inquest, Neddy Smith {{was interviewed}} four times by four {{separate}} teams of detectives. He {{claims that he}} was at home with his wife the night Huckstepp was murdered. However, he was secretly recorded confessing to a cellmate at Long Bay Correctional Centre. He was recorded saying he had attacked Huckstepp from behind, punched her, grabbed her by the throat, lifted her off the ground and then strangled her for about six minutes. Smith then claimed he dragged her into the pond and stood on her back to keep her head submerged for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes.</b> He was also recorded saying that [...] "strangling somebody is the hardest thing in the world...(but) the most satisfying thing I ever did in my life". Smith later dismissed his confession as lies, saying he knew he was being taped and wanted the publicity for his new book, Catch and Kill Your Own. He is also alleged to have confessed to his publisher. Smith was subsequently charged in September 1996 with Huckstepp's murder and was committed to stand trial, but was acquitted in 1999. In an interview with writer John Dale, Smith claimed that Huckstepp was murdered because she kept [...] "bugging Roger, ringing him up and leaving messages that he was a dog...The reason they didn't bury her or dispose of the body was Roger wanted her left floating in the pond as a message. The bloke who killed her has never been arrested and is not in jail".|$|E
2500|$|The #2-ranked Denver Pioneers, a team Pearson said [...] " [...] more {{balance and}} ... {{experience}} than the three teams we've seen so far", visited Michigan Tech the last weekend of October. The teams traded {{goals in the}} opening minutes of the Friday game, then Huskies forwards Milos Gordic, who played {{in his first two}} games of the year after recovering from shoulder surgery, and Ryan Furne scored 16seconds apart midway through the first period. Furne collided with and injured Denver goaltender Adam Murray after scoring, forcing coach George Gwozdecky to substitute Juho Olkinuora. In the second period, Gordic scored a power play goal and Josh Robinson stopped all 21Pioneers shots. Gwozdecky pulled Olkinuora with seven minutes left in the game, and Gordic completed his hat trick on an empty net a minute later. The Denver goal remained undefended for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes</b> – [...] "to try to work on our six-on-five situations", Gwozdecky said – and Brett Olson and Dennis Rix scored on the empty net. Denver added a late goal for a 7–2 final score. Robinson stopped 38 of 40shots. The next evening, Gordic and Denver forward Jason Zucker traded goals in an [...] "open, fast-paced first period [...] gave way to a choppy, penalty-filled second period". [...] The Pioneers took the lead on a second-period power play, then Olson beat Olkinuora off a rebound in the third period. The game went to overtime, but Tanner Kero was unable to convert either of two scoring opportunities late in the five-minute period. Michigan Tech earned three of four possible points with the win and tie, and Gordic and Robinson were named WCHA Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week, respectively. Pearson said after the series, [...] "If we [...] play like that we're going to win a lot of hockey games." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even Australia's {{collapse}} {{gave them}} a lead of 52 on a wicket which had dried out and looked a lot better for batting, but the England openers failed again. Peter Richardson was brilliantly caught and bowled by Richie Benaud who had relieved Alan Davidson. Peter May sent in Trevor Bailey—"The Barnacle"—at number three, a very negative move given his reputation as England should have been looking to runs. He was soon joined by Tom Graveney when Milton was caught by Wally Grout off Davidson at 34/2. The stylish Graveney was often criticised for getting out carelessly, but he survived two l.b.w. appeals in an over from Benaud, who beat the bat twice more without success. They took the score to 92/2 {{by the end of}} the day, a lead of 40 runs, with only 122 runs coming in the day. On the fourth day Graveney was halfway down the wicket going for an easy single when Bailey sent him back and he was run out for 36 after staying in for nearly three hours. May was soon out to Benaud (4/66), but Colin Cowdrey (28) stuck in for over two hours before he was caught by Lindsay Kline at grass level. Umpire McInnes was unsighted, but after a nod from Umpire Hays at square-leg umpire gave Cowdrey out, even though he was briefly called back by Harvey, who doubted that the ball had carried. [...] "The Boil" [...] remained glued to the crease for 357 minutes making the slowest 50 by an Englishman in Tests. [...] "Trevor was apt to enjoy playing a character part. 'Barnacle Bailey' as a sobriquet had stuck all too firmly...to the infinite frustration of the crowds—which here at Brisbane showed their feeling by simply staying away" [...] wrote E.W. Swanton, who questioned [...] "whether victory, if it should come, is worth the cost in terms of sterile, boring play that makes one sick at heart to watch". To be fair to Bailey he had [...] been hailed as a saviour playing in this fashion in 1953 and 1954–55 and was unlikely to change his style at the end of his career. Benaud did not help as he set the field to cut off the stonewaller's limited repertoire of strokes, with Meckiff bowling down the leg side. One pressman roused himself to ask when Bailey had last scored a run, [...] "Twenty minutes past two" [...] answered the England scorer George Duckworth, [...] "Today or yesterday?" [...] was the reply. Just before stumps Bailey suddenly rushed down the pitch to take a swipe at Mackay, missed and was bowled for 68. It was a strangely reckless end as a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>minutes</b> would have allowed Peter May the use of the heavy roller in the morning to break up the wicket for his bowlers. Bailey had batted for 458 minutes and scored from only 40 of the 427 balls he faced. Only 106 runs were made in a full day's play, the lowest in an Ashes Test.|$|E
