5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alternative country music scene.

Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles {{as diverse as the}} hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{development}} plans in place, including {{the construction of}} new government buildings, waterfront redevelopment in Central, and a series of projects in West Kowloon.

The Urban Renewal Authority is highly active in demolishing older areas, including the razing and redevelopment of Kwun Tong town centre, an approach which has been criticised for <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cultural identity of the city and on lower-income residents.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version.

5|$|Freeway {{construction}} had <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city, with neighborhoods disrupted {{and housing}} stock lost. Between 1963 and 1975, Interstate 35W {{from the south}} border {{of the city to}} its northeastern corner, Interstate 94 from the St. Paul border into downtown, and the Crosstown (County Road 62, later to become Minnesota State Highway 62) on the southern boundary of Minneapolis were built. The remaining portion of Interstate 94, from U.S. Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the city, was completed in 1982. Highway 12 was later rebuilt to Interstate standards in 1992, at which point it was renumbered Interstate 394. Several proposed projects never were built, though. Minnesota State Highway 55, running southeast from downtown to the Fort Snelling area and the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport, was slated to become a freeway, but the upgrade was canceled due to neighborhood opposition. Similarly, a proposed Interstate 335 was to run from Interstate 35W in northeast Minneapolis to a connection with Interstate 94 just north of downtown. This project was also canceled due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E
5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E

40|$|Vietnam {{has been}} quite sucessful in {{attracting}} FDI inflows {{since the inception of}} economic reform in 1986. The inflow of FDI has contributed significantly to the economic development of Vietnam. Still, the determinants of FDI inflow and <b>its</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economy of Vietnam are under-researched.

Our regression analysis of the determinants of FDI spatial distribution across provinces points to the importance of market, labour and infrastructure in attracting FDI.
