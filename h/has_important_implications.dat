5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with {{responsibilities}} like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications.</b> Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> for {{the concept of}} dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who {{compiled a list of}} cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} rankings can divert universities’ {{attention}} away from teaching and social responsibility towards the type of scientific research valued by indicators used for ranking exercises. There have also been concerns that by applying a limited set of criteria to world universities, and given the strong desire to feature in the top 200 universities, rankings actually encourage the homogenization of higher education institutions, making them less responsive and less relevant to their immediate contexts. The fact that rankings are also said to favour the advantage enjoyed by the 200 best-ranked institutions <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> for equity.|$|E
25|$|In {{experiments}} where nerve {{injury is}} caused but nearby C fibers remain intact, increased spontaneous {{activity in the}} C fibers is observed. This phenomenon supports the theory that damaged nerve fibers may release factors that alter the function of neighboring undamaged fibers. Study of Remak bundles <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> in nerve regeneration after sustaining injury. Currently, recovery of distal C fiber function takes months and may still only regain incomplete function. This may result in abnormal sensory function or neuropathic pain. Remak bundles are thought to release certain trophic factors that promote the regeneration of the damaged axons.|$|E
25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning. This <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> {{for engaging in}} risky behavior such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents {{are less likely to}} inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future. This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} agency implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions. The sense of agency plays {{a pivotal role}} in {{cognitive}} development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds theory of mind capacities. Indeed, the ability to recognize oneself as the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world. The sense of agency and its scientific study <b>has</b> <b>important</b> <b>implications</b> in social cognition, moral reasoning, and psychopathology. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist Shaun Gallagher. Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell, and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.|$|E
