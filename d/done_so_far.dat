Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Japanese director Yusuke Tanaka. The video features Perfume as robots, controlled by an automated-computer to perform human-like interactions such as eating, dancing, smiling and crying. Some verses and the choruses feature the group dancing to the song. It ends with member Nocchi pulling the power-plug from member A-chan's back, shutting down the computer and Perfume. The members stated that they found it interesting to try and imitate the image of themselves as robots and dolls and found the choreography {{to be the most}} powerful that they've <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b>|$|E
5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran said that it was the best she has <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that takes a look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E

5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{projects}} aiming to develop a car {{on the principles of}} open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org) and c,mm,n. None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consequently, most {{of works}} <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> are mainly {{based on the}} {{findings}} of the archaeological excavation and studying the artefacts from the archaeological perspective. The first study on this monument with documentation was by archaeologist K.N. Dikhist in his Paharpur, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey in India (1938). Dikhsit was concerned with documentation of the archaeological findings and concentrated on their interpretation and analysis. He attempted to suggest a probable architectural treatment of the missing parts of the structure through studying the archaeological remains. Till today, this study is considered as the most authentic record of the Sompur Mahavihara.|$|E

25|$|Gregory next {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Germany. In 718, he was approached by an Anglo-Saxon missionary, Winfrid, who proposed undertaking missionary work in Germany. Gregory agreed, and after changing his name to Boniface, commissioned him in May 719 to preach in Germany. After hearing of the work that had been <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> in 722 Gregory summoned Boniface back to Rome to answer rumours concerning Boniface’s doctrinal purity. Interestingly, at this face to face meeting, Boniface complained that he found Gregory’s Latin difficult to understand, a clear indication that Vulgar Latin had already started to evolve into the Romance languages. After examining Boniface’s written profession of faith, Gregory was satisfied enough that he made Boniface a bishop in November 722, and returned him to Germany to continue his mission. Continued successes saw Gregory write to Boniface in December 724 to offer his congratulations, followed in November 726 by a response to Boniface’s questions about how to structure the newly emergent churches in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It {{can be seen as the}} dolphin equivalent of a name for humans. These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime. In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing. Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years. Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.|$|E

In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E

They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens.

[...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before.
