5|$|Malvern {{had already}} become an {{overspill}} for the nearby city of Worcester, {{and the new}} motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large private housing developments. The town continues to swell as <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{is portrayed}} by Canadian actor William B. Davis. When Davis first {{received}} the role, the character was written {{as an extra}} for the pilot episode.

5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, {{the heir}} {{presumptive}} to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha {{was his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> clear that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's heir presumptive on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, {{track and}} field became <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> {{professional}} and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E

5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy {{it takes to}} remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

5|$|When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the American ice trade {{received}} a temporary boost to production. Shipments of chilled food to Europe surged during the war, placing significant {{demands on the}} country's existing refrigeration capabilities, while the need to produce munitions for the war effort meant that ammonia and coal for refrigeration plants were in short supply. The U.S. government worked together with the plant and natural ice industries to promote the use of natural ice to relieve the burden and maintain adequate supplies. For Britain and Norway, however, the war impacted badly on the natural ice trade; the German attempt to blockade the North Sea with U-boats made shipments difficult and Britain relied <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> heavily on its limited number of ice plants for supplies instead.|$|E
5|$|Wild Arms is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that involves the}} player controlling up to three characters, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they progress {{through a number of}} environments, battle enemies, and solve puzzles. The game is presented in a top-down two-dimensional fashion where the player has an overhead view of all the action taking place on a particular screen. To advance, the player must overcome a number of story-based scenarios and sequences that involve navigating through dungeons while fighting enemies that appear randomly. Characters progress and grow by gaining experience points after a battle, discovering crest graphs, finding ARMs, and mastering sword techniques prompted by various events in the game. This allows them to battle <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> difficult demonic entities.|$|E
5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} a formality until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, Saomai's eye became cloud-filled, and {{the storm}} {{began to develop}} {{concentric}} eyewalls. Shortly after 1000UTC on September12, the typhoon made landfall on central Okinawa, Japan with sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg). Saomai quickly passed over the island, and concurrently its weakening phase came to a halt. After tracking into the East China Sea, the typhoon began to track towards the northeast {{in response to a}} mid-latitude trough. At its westernmost point along its track, Saomai was located approximately 345km (215mi) east of Wenzhou, China. Atmospheric conditions became <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> hostile as Saomai tracked northeast, and the typhoon became elongated and ragged in appearance. At 1200UTC on September15, Saomai was downgraded to severe tropical storm intensity as the cyclone began to undergo extratropical transition. At around 2030UTC that day, Saomai made its final landfall as a tropical system west of Pusan, South Korea; after emerging into the Yellow Sea the storm was declared extratropical at 0600UTC the next day. These remnants later tracked inland near Vladivostok, Russia before dissipating on September19.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E

5|$|In the 15th {{and early}} 16th centuries, Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Although the castle's military defences were mobilised by Henry VI in 1461 during the Wars of the Roses, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> prominent as a hunting facility. The role of the constable of the castle was often combined {{with that of the}} surveyor or ranger of Rising Chase, the parkland around the castle. The castle may have been a prestigious location during this period, although its facilities were not as extensive as those of other castles and manors known for their hunting. Senior visitors to the castle included Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and Charles Brandon, the Duke of Suffolk, and its constables included nobles such as Lord Ralph de Cromwell and John de Vere, the Earl of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{began the}} 1998–99 {{season with a}} 2–1 defeat in the 1998 Supercoppa Italiana {{at the hands of}} Lazio, {{although}} Del Piero was able to score from a penalty. On 8 November 1998, Del Piero picked up a serious knee injury in the final minutes of a 2–2 draw with Udinese; this kept him out of action {{for the remainder of the}} season, as he managed only 2 goals. The club struggled without him, finishing the league season in a disappointing sixth place. Juventus did manage to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League that season, however, losing out to eventual Champions Manchester United. Following his serious injury, Del Piero underwent a muscle strengthening regime in order to adapt to the <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> physical and athletic demands of twenty-first century football, which allowed him to compensate for the loss of some of his pace and agility. Due to his dramatic weight gain and physical development during this period, as well as the club's success during the mid to late 90s, Del Piero, along with several other Juventus players and staff members, was accused of being involved in illegal performance-enhancing drug abuse; after a lengthy investigation, the club, as well as its players and staff, was eventually cleared of all doping allegations in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. Contrary to popular belief, the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved into the far bottom corner of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. They seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look <b>increasingly</b> <b>more</b> dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E
