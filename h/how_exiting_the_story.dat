40|$|Abstract. We examine job-related social {{processes}} and outcomes in a randomized housing experiment in which “treated ” families relocated from public housing in high poverty, inner-city neighborhoods to privately run housing in low poverty ones.

Combining qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldnotes, and survey {{data on the}} adults with census and administrative data on the changing geography of jobs, we conclude {{that the lack of}} generalized treatment effects for job-ready participants so far owes to: the challenges of securing jobs-housing-support matches where the markets are turbulent and informal social support is vital but unpredictable; and the challenges for parents of “converting ” new locations into new social and institutional resources while retaining pre-move resources, such as accessible childcare. Yet neighborhoods can matter (as locations) even where neighbors do not: “Successful ” relocation actually led to a loss of spatial access to entry-level job centers, new job creation, and net jo...|$|R

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we analyzed the (phospho) proteome of {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) during differentiation induced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and removal of hESC growth factors. Of 5222 proteins identified, 1399 were phosphorylated on 3067 residues. Approximately 50 % of these phosphosites were regulated within 1 hr of differentiation induction, revealing a complex interplay of phosphorylation networks spanning different signaling pathways and kinase activities. Among the phosphorylated proteins was the pluripotency-associated protein SOX 2, which was SUMOylated {{as a result of}} phosphorylation. Using the data to predict kinase-substrate relationships, we reconstructed the hESC kinome; CDK 1 / 2 emerged as central in controlling self-renewal and lineage specification.

40|$|BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a {{widespread}} human pathogen that establishes a lifelong persistent infection and can cause severe disease in immunosuppressed patients. BKPyV is a nonenveloped DNA virus that must traffic through the endoplasmic reticu-lum (ER) for productive infection to occur; however, it is unknown <b>how</b> BKPyV <b>exits</b> <b>the</b> ER before nuclear entry. In this study, we elucidated {{the role of the}} ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway during BKPyV intracellular trafficking in renal proxi-mal tubule epithelial (RPTE) cells, a natural host cell. Using proteasome and ERAD inhibitors, we showed that ERAD is required for productive entry. Altered trafficking and accumulation of uncoated viral intermediates were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence in the presence of an inhibitor. Additionally, we detected a change in localiza-tion of partially uncoated virus within the ER during proteasome inhibition, from a BiP-rich area to a calnexin-rich subregion, indicating that BKPyV accumulated in an ER subcompartment. Furthermore, inhibiting ERAD did not prevent entry of capsid protein VP 1 into the cytosol from the ER. By comparing the cytosolic entry of the related polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV 40), we found that dependence on the ERAD pathway for cytosolic entry varied between the polyomaviruses and between different cell types, namely, immortalized CV- 1 cells and primary RPTE cells.
