50|$|The Japanese {{vehicles}} had rear lap belts only on {{the lower}} trim levels and 3-point outboard position lap and shoulder belts with a center rear position lap belt on all vehicles with the 2.0-liter engine. Seat belt pre-tensioners with <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.) were standard equipment in Japanese vehicles with the VZ trim package and all vehicles equipped with the turbocharged engine.|$|E
50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety belts with <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate lap belts previously used. A center lap safety belt with slack adjustment was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|E
50|$|Venzas feature vehicle {{stability}} control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock braking, smart stop {{technology as}} well as hill-start Control, Tire pressure monitoring system, active head restraints for front-seat occupants, 3-point seatbelts and headrests for all seats, <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> (ELR) for all seats, automatic locking retractors (ATR) for all seats (except driver's), front seatbelt pretensioners with force limiters, and LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) for rear outboard seats.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} trim levels {{available}} Standard, Comfortable and Luxury. Both Comfortable and Luxury include air conditioning, alloy wheels, ABS, EBD, CD/MP3 player, electric windows, power steering, trip computer, rear reverse radar and central locking. The Luxury model includes front three-point seat belts with <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> <b>retractor</b> (ELR).|$|R
5000|$|Items {{that were}} {{optional}} on the Accord, such as cruise control, air conditioning with automatic fan speed control and thermostatically monitored temperature, power windows with driver's one touch express down, and power steering were standard on the Vigor. A trip computer that displayed mileage, driving time, and fuel economy that Honda called in sales brochure literature as [...] "Electronic Navigator" [...] was also standard on the Vigor. All Vigors were also equipped with ELR (<b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractor)</b> seatbelts. One of the optional {{items on the}} Vigor was an Electro Gyrocator, the world's first automatic in-car navigation system. Other items included digital instrumentation, four-wheel Anti-lock brakes, a choice of stereo systems from Alpine Electronics, Clarion, and Pioneer, alloy wheels (13-inch), and adjustable thigh support on the front passenger seat.|$|R
50|$|A two air bag {{supplementary}} {{restraint system}} (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and <b>locking</b> <b>retractors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Legend offered many Honda [...] "firsts", such as {{a driver}} side airbag, vehicle speed {{sensitive}} power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock brakes, seat belt pre-tensioners with <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>Retractors</b> (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and [...] "TCS" [...] Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given {{to make sure the}} Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at 100 km/h using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.|$|E
50|$|Violence {{and threats}} {{are a common}} {{occurrence}} at the hospital's emergency room in Malmö and therefore guards are employed on a 24hr basis, and <b>emergency</b> <b>lock</b> down has been installed along with security cameras. All employees have been given training in self-defence and wear alarms in case they are attacked. The <b>emergency</b> <b>lock</b> down {{makes it impossible for}} threatening people outside the building to enter the premises. The reason for these measures is an upsurge in aggressive patients with drug problems and a society where levels of violence are on the rise due to the level of organised crime using lethal violence based in Malmö. In March 2017 the <b>emergency</b> room started <b>locking</b> its door between 2100-0500 {{to reduce the number of}} violent incidents involving people who sought to meet or get information about patients.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>locking</b> <b>retractors</b> {{is to provide}} the seated {{occupant}} the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The MADYMO {{simulation}} {{model of the}} rear occupant restraint system based a current car model was constructed, researching {{the influence of the}} rear seat cushion stiffness and cushion angle with the floor, the 3 -point seatbelt webbing stiffness and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature on rear-seat passenger safety in the head-on collision. Thereafter, the entire rear occupant restraint system was optimised. The result shows when the rear seat cushion stiffness is 30 N/mm, the cushion angle is 25 °, the safety belt stiffness is 11 % and the webbing output after the <b>retractor</b> <b>locks</b> is 30 mm, rear occupant would obtain the optimum protection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} injury values rear seat {{occupants}} sustain in the frontal collision, this paper constructed the simulation {{model of the}} rear occupant restraint system of a vehicle model using MADYMO software. The influence of the rear 3 -point seatbelt stiffness and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature, the rear seat cushion stiffness and angle with the vehicle floor on head injury criterion HIC 36, thorax 3 ms resultant acceleration T 3 MS, thorax performance criterion THPC, left and right femur force of rear occupants were analysed through the simulation model. The conclusion shows that HIC 36 drops when the seatbelt stiffness increases and <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> feature decreases compared to the original values; HIC 36, T 3 MS, left and right femur force become less when the seat cushion stiffness decreases and angle increases compared to the original values...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> unit (ELU) for a {{seat belt}} {{retractor}} which is mounted on the back frame of a vehicle seat. The proposed unit uses a recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor and solenoid mechanism. The seat has an upper frame supported to tilt on a lower frame. The retractor in belt in seat (BIS) system is supported by the upper frame. The proposed recliner sensor based on a MEMS acceleration sensor comprises orientation means for maintaining a predetermined orientation of emergency relative to the lower frame independently of the force of gravity when the upper frame tilts on the lower frame. Experimental results show that the developed recliner sensor unit operates effectively with respect to rollover angles. Thus, the developed unit will have a considerable potential to offer a new design concept in BIS system...|$|R
50|$|The Mannlicher-Schönauer rifle was one {{of these}} novel designs. The rifle action was {{designed}} by Ferdinand Mannlicher and the rotary magazine by his protegee Otto Schönauer of the Österreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft (Austrian Arms-Manufacturing Company; now Steyr Mannlicher). While the more famous Mannlicher M1895 used the less common straight-pull bolt, the Mannlicher-Schönauer had a conventional turn-bolt, more reminiscent of the Gewehr 88 and other typical military bolt-action rifles. At first sight many confuse it with a Mauser rifle, due to the similar bolt and handguards. The Mannlicher-Schönauer may be identified by the split {{in the rear of the}} receiver which allows the bolt handle to pass through, and double as an <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> lug when closed, in case of failure of the primary locking lugs. The characteristic that sets this design apart from others of the era though was the innovative Schönauer rotating spool magazine.|$|R

It attempts to kill Jill, but she traps it {{in a room}} after the apartment's doors lock. Lincoln sees the robot close the blinds while trying to peep on Jill, and, after he briefly manages to open the apartment door and sexually harasses her, offers to override the <b>emergency</b> <b>lock</b> that traps them in her apartment. Lincoln dismisses her warnings of a killer robot, and, when he attempts to open Jill's blinds {{so that he can}} more easily peep on her, the M.A.R.K. 13 brutally kills him. Jill flees into her kitchen, where she reasons that her refrigerator will hide her from the robot's infrared vision. She damages the robot before Mo, Shades, and the apartment's security team arrive and open fire on it, apparently destroying it.|$|R

50|$|The Vetterli rifle was {{the first}} bolt action repeating rifle {{introduced}} by an army. It {{was used by the}} Swiss army from 1869 to circa 1890. Modified Vetterlis were also used by the Italian Army. Another notable design is the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen, which was used by Norway, Denmark, and briefly the United States. It is unusual among bolt-action rifles in that is loaded through a gate on right side of the receiver, and thus can be reloaded without opening the bolt. The Norwegian and Danish versions of the Krag have two locking lugs, while the American version has only one. In all versions, the bolt handle itself serves as an <b>emergency</b> <b>locking</b> lug. The Krag's major disadvantage compared to other bolt-action designs is that it is usually loaded by hand, one round at a time, although a box-like device was made that could drop five rounds into the magazine, all at once. This made it slower to reload than other designs which used stripper or en-bloc clips. Another historically important bolt-action system was the Gras system, used on the French Mle 1874 Gras rifle and the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle, which was first to introduce ammunition loaded with nitrocellulose-based smokeless powder.|$|R

By then, a “population control” approach had been implemented — the so-called Briggs Plan for resettling 500, 000 Chinese squatters.

5000|$|Players {{who have}} the ability to play a number of {{positions}} in a team are called utility players. Utility players can be seen as [...] "Jack of all trades" [...] and they generally occupy the reserve position in a team. For this reason, many try to avoid being labelled as utilities. Players in the forward positions are generally more specialised than those that play in the backs. However, flankers can usually play number eight and sometimes the blindside may be used as a lock. The front row positions are usually very specialised, although some props can play both sides or even hooker. South African captain and IRB Hall of Fame member John Smit is one player who has played test matches in every front row position. Another IRB Hall member to have played multiple forward positions is 2013 inductee John Thornett, an Australian utility forward who played at flanker, number 8, lock and prop for the Wallabies from 1955 to 1967. Utility backs tend to cover a greater number of positions, with players commonly switching between scrum-half and fly-half, fly-half and centre or wing and full-back.Another famous utility player was Austin Healey, who started and played test matches for England and club matches for Leicester Tigers at fly half, scrum half, full back and winger. Among members of the International Rugby or IRB Halls of Fame, Mike Gibson has 28 caps at fly-half, 48 at centre and 4 on the wing and Tim Horan played 62 tests at centre, 2 on the wing and 9 at full-back. Danie Craven mostly played at half-back, but has also started a Test in the forwards at number 8. 2013 IRB Hall inductee Waisale Serevi, although most famous as a sevens player and primarily a fly-half in 15s, also started Tests as a scrum-half, wing and full-back, and came off the bench once as a centre and once as an <b>emergency</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R

40|$|Applying the pretensioners and {{the belt}} force {{limiters}} in cars {{had a positive}} impact on the seat belts effectiveness in protecting the people driving against the effects of collisions. In this way, delayed action of the seat belts, resulting from the flexibility of the belt and the operating time of the <b>retractor</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism, was partially eliminated. The tasks and properties of the pretensioners and force limiters used in cars will be described in the paper. Implementations of the forces acting at the driver's lap belts and shoulder belts during a frontal collision into a rigid barrier, at the speed of 56 km/h, will be presented.
