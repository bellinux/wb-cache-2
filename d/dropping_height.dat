50|$|Crows and WhelksOn the Pacific {{coast of}} Canada, crows forage on whelks, {{a species of}} mollusk. To break the shell of the mollusk, the crows fly and drop the whelks on rocks. Reto Zach {{constructed}} an optimality model to predict the optimal height at which crows drop the whelks. The benefit in this model is the success rate of cracking the whelk’s shell, while the primary cost is the energy spent flying. If the crows did not fly high enough, they would have little success in breaking the whelks’ shells. However, the crows could waste valuable energy if they climb too high. In his model, Zach predicted the optimal height for crows to drop the whelks. To do this, Zach calculated the total distance each whelk was dropped before it was successfully broken. Whelks dropped from 3 meters and lower actually had traveled high total distances {{because they had to}} be dropped numerous times in order to be broken. On the other hand, whelks dropped from 5 meters and 15 meters were dropped approximately the same number of times to initiate a break; however, the crows would obviously have to climb higher to break a whelk at 15 meters than at 5 meters. Zach predicted 5 meters to be the optimal <b>dropping</b> <b>height.</b> The results indicated that the crows do follow this model, as the average <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> was 5.2 meters.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternating}} {{cycle of}} negative-positive work phases {{in the lower}} legs during vertical jumps represents a sequence where storage and utilization of elastic energy takes place. It is possible that energy storage and its utilization depend on the stretch load capacity of activated muscles in legs. It {{is also possible that}} there may be a difference between trained and untrained subjects in stretch load capacity. To investigate these assumed differences and to evaluate the leg stretch load capacity, fourteen male subjects were assigned to either a trained (N = 7) or untrained (N = 7) group. All subjects performed two vertical jumps, drop jump and counter-movement jump, at four different heights (20, 35, 50 and 65 cm). A Locam 16 mm high speed camera was used to film the all movements during two vertical jump tests. A Sonic digitizer interfaced to VAX was used to digitize the film data in this study. As expected, the mechanical work, vertical force and vertical velocity during landing phase increased with the increase of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> for both of the groups. But, these selected biomechanical variables, including positive work, force, kinetic energy and jumping performance, during take-off phase for trained subjects increased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> was increased from 20 to 50 cm,and then decreased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> increased up to 65 cm; for untrained subjects increased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> increased from 20 to 35 cm, and then decreased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> up to 50 or 65 cm. In counter-movement test, the mechanical energy output during positive phase increased with increase of jumped heights. The results of present study revealed that the main effects of drop jump as one of the most popular plyometric drills to influence jumping performance are significant.

40|$|In the literature, athletes {{preparing}} for explosive activities are recommended to include drop jumping in their training programs. For {{the execution of}} drop jumps, different techniques and different dropping heights can be used. This {{study was designed to}} investigate for the performance of bounce drop jumps the influence of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> on the biomechanics of the jumps. Six subjects executed bounce drop jumps from heights of 20 cm (designated here as DJ 20), 40 cm (designated here as DJ 40), and 60 cm (designated here as DJ 60). During jumping, they were filmed, and ground reaction forces were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show no difference between DJ 20 and DJ 40 in mechanical output about the joints during the push-off phase. Peak values of moment and power output about the ankles during the push-off phase were found to be smaller in DJ 60 than in DJ 40 (DJ 20 = DJ 60). The amplitude of joint reaction forces increased with <b>dropping</b> <b>height.</b> During DJ 60, the net joint reaction forces showed a sharp peak on the instant that the heels came down on the ground.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} static stretching on performance during drop jumps. Furthermore, we investigated if a reduction in <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> would compensate the stretching-caused alterations. Ten physically active male subjects performed drop jumps at four different <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> without static stretching for the optimal <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> determination. After, they performed drop jumps on two <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> with static stretching previously. The jump height, contact time and reactive strength index were significantly affected by static stretching. However, only the contact time was significantly improved by the reduction in <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> with previous static stretching. Our {{results suggest that the}} decrement in performance after static stretching could be partially compensated by a reduction in <b>drop</b> <b>height,</b> which decreases the contact time near a non-stretching jump condition. This {{can be explained by the}} lower landing velocity and, possibly, the smaller reduction in the activation of the plantar flexors muscles. In conclusion, the reduction in <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> seems to be interesting after a static stretching session, aiming to expose the athletes to lower impact forces to maintain jump performance...|$|R

One of the most {{important}} mechanical damages that can reduce the quality of ripe fruit quality is abrasion damage. This study focused on the effect of dynamic loading based on customary harvesting method on mulberry fruit properties. To this end, different maturity stage and storage regimes were considered. Color quality parameters, firmness, total soluble solid (TSS), total anthocyanins content (TAC) and abrasion area were the measured factors. The results revealed that none of the surveyed factors were stable during the experiment. The lightness (Lâ), redness (aâ), yellowness (bâ), Câ value, firmness, TSS and TAC of immature and mature mulberry decreased during storage. The value of aâ, bâ and Câ increased as <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> increased. However, Lâ value, firmness, TSS and TAC of mulberry fruit decreased at both maturity stages (immature and mature mulberry).

The compression force increased from soft to natural to stiff instruction for both {{low and high}} <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> and was greater for the high <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> (Fig.  2 a). Since the {{increase in}} landing stiffness produced a linear scaling of the ground reaction force and the knee compression force, {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that a similar pattern between <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> and landing stiffness would be observed in the knee flexion moment, i.e., the increase in the flexion moment from soft to natural to stiff for the low and high heights. However, this was not the case. While the instruction to increase landing stiffness from the high height did result in the increase of the knee flexion moment, {{there was no difference in}} the moment observed with this instruction during landing from the low height.|$|R

40|$|The {{quantification}} of {{particulate matter}} emissions from mineral handling {{is an important}} problem for the quantification of global emissions on industrial sites. Mineral particulate matter emissions could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading is an important process contributing to mineral particulate matter emissions, especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate particulate matter emissions during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict particulate matter emissions accurately under weak wind conditions. At low particulate matter emissions, the models overestimated, and at high particulate matter emissions, the models underestimated emission factors.

40|$|Background: The {{success of}} complex {{molecular}} cytogenetic studies depends on having properly spread chromosomes. However, inconsistency of optimum chromosome spreading remains {{a major problem}} in cytogenetic studies. Methods: The metaphase spreading process was carefully timed to identify the most critical phase of chromosome spreading. The effects of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> of cell suspension, slide condition, drying time, fixative ratio, and relative humidity on the quality of metaphase spreads were studied by quantitative examination of metaphase chromosome spreads. Normal and immortalized human epithelial ovarian cells, neuroblastoma cells, and normal lymphocytes were tested. Results: Humidity over the slide was the most important variable affecting the quality of chromosome spreads. Consistent improvement in chromosome spreading (larger metaphase area, less chromosome overlaps, or lower frequencies of broken metaphases) was obtained for all cell types if dynamic cell rehydration, occurring as fixative absorbs moisture from air, was made to coincide with the prompt fixation of spread chromosomes to the slide. This was achieved by dropping cells on dry glass slides placed in a shallow metal tray and then quickly lowering the tray into a covered 50 °C water bath for slide drying.

40|$|Introduction: Chinese paratroopers have {{traditionally}} performed the half-squat parachute landing (HSPL), which {{was different from}} the wellknown parachute landing fall. During HSPL, ankle biomechanics have been shown to vary greatly between genders. Therefore, it is necessary to consider gender with regard to the design of ankle stabilizers for paratroopers. Methods: Eight male and eight female healthy participants landed from platforms under three ankle conditions based on different stabilizer rigidity levels (barefoot control, elastic tape, and semi-rigid brace). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects and interactions of ankle stabilizer, gender, and <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> on the ground reaction forces (GRF), ankle kinematics, and the shank surface electromyogram (EMG). Results: Compared to men, women had signifi -cantly higher peak medial-lateral GRF when they were equipped with stabilizers (tape: men 0. 521 vs. women 0. 856 bodyweight; brace: men 0. 531 vs. 0. 935 bodyweight), except when barefoot. Both stabilizers signifi cantly decreased all peak angular displacements, but no signifi cant interaction was detected between gender and stabilizer rigidity in ankle kinematics. Compared to barefoot, the semi-rigid brace signifi cantly increased male pre-landing EMG amplitude of the tibialis anterior from 218 to 525 m V and post-landing EMG amplitude of the lateral gastrocnemius from 323 to 910 m V, but no corresponding change took place in women. Discussion: The semi-rigid stabilizer was helpful for men in increasing shank muscle activities. Increased stabilizer rigidity had little infl uence on the muscle activities of women and this could contribute to greater injury risk in women during HSPL.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} in skilled volleyball players (a) the effect of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> on women's and men's performance and (b) the drop jump technique with regard to gender. Nine male and 9 female skilled volleyball players were instructed to jump as high as they could, using a drop jump, from a box of 30 cm or from 2 boxes (60 cm). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using 6 cameras and a force plate. The human body was summarized by using a 4 -segment model (foot, shank, thigh, head-arms-trunk). Males performed higher jumps than females (46. 6 +/- 7. 5 cm vs. 36 +/- 5. 4 cm; p < 0. 05). This could be explained by higher mean power (56. 9 +/- 26 W/kg vs. 42. 4 +/- 19 W/kg; p < 0. 05) and shorter eccentric time (- 46. 3 %), both of which allowed a better stretch-shortening cycle. This study shows that women and men have different jump techniques when they drop from a higher position but without increasing the vertical performance. Women increase the values of force and stiffness (respectively + 21. 4 % and + 17. 9 %) without changing the temporal structure of the jump.

The subjects were tested for 1 RM, countermovement jump, squat jump, and DJs from 0. 24, 0. 36, 0. 48, 0. 60, 0. 72, and 0. 84 m. Jump height (JH) was calculated for all jumps and relative peak eccentric force, relative peak concentric force, ground contact time (GCT), and reactive strength index were also calculated for DJs. Pearson correlations were used {{to examine the relationship between}} 1 RM relative to body mass (BM) (1 RM/BM) and JHs, reactive strength index, and GCT during DJs. The subjects were placed in a high strength (HS) or low strength (LS) group depending on whether or not their 1 RM/BM was 1.

Conflicts in published research raised {{a series of questions}} on the precision of the measurements used to differentiate between vertical jumps performed with and without pre-stretch. Procedures outlined by previous researchers (eg. Komi and Bosco, 1978 a; Bedi et al., 1987) were repeated and extended. Force plate data were collected for a series of squat, counter movement and rebound jumps. Individual subjects responded differently and no evidence could be found for an optimal rebound <b>dropping</b> <b>height.</b> Modal analysis of the force plate highlighted the need for improving its mounting. A frame was designed to raise the resonant frequency of the plate and static and dynamic calibrations revealed point of force application errors. 16 mm cinefilm was selected in preference to video for the subsequent inverse dynamics analysis of rebound jumping. French physiologist, Marey, observed that people appeared to jump higher following a rebound than a counter movement. A 'Marey' style jumping exercise was used to examine different takeoff and landing strategies. Variations in kinematic data filtering, body segment inertia parameters and quasi-static analysis techniques on the resultant moment moments were investigated. No differences in maximum jump height were found between counter movement and rebound jump takeoffs. This apparent contraction to the findings in previous research was accounted for by variations in the subjects' stretch heights at takeoff. A general proximal to distal sequencing of muscle moment peaking was observed in both takeoff actions, but moments peaked later in rebound takeoffs than when following counter movements. Larger peak moments occurred during landings preceding coming to rest than during the landing phase of the rebound jump. Quasi-statically determined muscle moments about the ankles and knees matched closely with the inverse dynamics values, but joint and overall support moments were consistently over estimated. Conflicts with selected published research findings were shown to arise from a lack of measurement precision. Takeoff velocities were greater following counter movements, but were insufficient to differentiate between jumping techniques. Rebounding was found to increase leg extension. Improvements in automatic measurement procedures combined with an enhanced understanding of musculo-skeletal modelling were seen as a way of improving future knowledge of neuromuscular coordination and power production in jumping...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a standard procedure to measure the airborne concentrations of different size particles within the vicinity of a dropped container where a significant portion of the contained powder is ejected. Tungsten oxide (WO{sub 3 }) was selected in this study to represent relatively heavy powders (7. 16 g/cm 3 specific gravity for WO{sub 3 }). A typical can with the outer dimensions of 4. 25 ” diameter and 4. 875 ” tall was used as the container.

The packing volume of the powder was 51. 4 in 3 (842. 7 cm{sup 3 }) and the target mass was 1936 g. The tests were carried out in a full-scale stainless steel environmental chamber with an interior volume of 852 ft 3 (24. 1 m 3). The chamber system includes an internal recirculation loop with a rectangular air diffuser and 10 variable frequency drive fans to provide a typical room air recirculation flow pattern.

40|$|Introduction: The {{pomegranate}} {{journey from}} orchard to supermarket is very complex and pomegranates {{are subjected to}} the variety of static and dynamic loads {{that could result in}} this damage and bruise occurring. Bruise area and bruise volume are the most important parameters to evaluate fruit damage occurred in harvest and postharvest stages. The bruising is defined as damage to fruit flesh usually with no abrasion of the peel. The two different types of dynamic loading which can physically cause fruit bruising are impact and vibration. The impact and vibration loadings may occur during picking or sorting as the pomegranates are dropped into storage bins and during transportation. The focus of this work was on the impact loading as this appeared to be the most prevalent. In view of the limitations of conventional testing methods (ASTM D 3332 Standard Test Methods for Mechanical Shock Fragility of Products), the method and procedure for determining dropping bruise boundary of fruit were also established by adapting free-fall dropping tests. Materials and Methods: After the ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates had been selected, they were numbered, and the weight and dimension of each sample were measured and recorded. Firmness in cheek region of each fruit was also measured. Fruit firmness was determined by measuring the maximum force during perforating the sample to a depth of 10 mm at a velocity of 100 mm min- 1 with an 8 mm diameter cylindrical penetrometer mounted onto a STM- 5 Universal Testing Machine (SANTAM, Design CO. LTD., England). Free-fall dropping tests with a series of drop heights (6, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 60 cm) were conducted on fresh ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates. Three samples were used for each <b>dropping</b> <b>height,</b> and each sample was subjected to impact on two different positions. Before the test was started, it was necessary to control the sample's drop position. The cheek of sample was placed on the fruit holder. An aluminum plate mounted on upper part of the piezoelectric force sensor was the dropping impact surface of the device. After dropping impact, the sample was caught by hand to prevent a second impact due to sample rebound. After impact, the samples were stored at room temperature for 48 h, during which time bruise tissues and arils turned brown. The bruise area and bruise volume of each sample were calculated according to equations (1 and 2). Results and Discussion: Dropping impact acceleration versus time curves for the typical samples at ten drop heights are shown in figure 5. Drop height notably affected the impact acceleration. The peak force increased while contact times decreased with increasing drop height, which resulted in an increase of peak acceleration. Figure 6 shows the dropping impact velocity change during contact by theoretical calculation. The results showed that the velocities at the beginning of contact and the rebound velocities of the samples increased with increasing the drop height. Critical drop height of pomegranate in certain bruise area was determined and linear relationship between drop height and bruise volume for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates were obtained. It is clear that there were obvious differences between dropping bruise boundaries of pomegranates and the conventional damage boundary of products (as shown in figure 9). For the conventional damage boundary, the vertical line, critical velocity (Vc), represents the velocity change below which no damage occurs, regardless of the peak pulse acceleration. The horizontal line, critical acceleration (AC), represents the acceleration at which the product will be damaged if velocity exceeds VC. At the same time, for a conventional product, there is only one damage boundary at one shock condition. However, for fruit, a change in drop height (velocity) will lead to a change in bruise ratio. A series of bruise boundaries can be determined for different bruise ratios. Moreover, even if the velocity approaches zero, the fruit can still be bruised if its acceleration exceeds a certain value. These relationships provide an effective basis to predict and control drop bruising, which may be achieved through the design of reasonable cushioning packaging for fruit. Conclusions: This research applied the concept of dropping bruise for pomegranate fruits. Because of the limitations in using conventional testing methods to test product of a viscoelastic nature, such as fruit, free fall dropping tests were adapted to determine dropping bruise fragility and bruise boundary for ‘Malas-e-Saveh’ pomegranates at different drop heights. For viscoelastic products such as fruit, even if the dropping impact velocity approached zero, the fruit could be bruised as long as the impact acceleration exceeded a certain value (critical acceleration). A series of bruise boundaries can be established for different levels of bruise ratios, i. e., a contour of constant bruise ratio can be drawn on the velocity acceleration plane...|$|E

Jump athletes (Jumper group, n= 13) and Other athletes (Other group, n= 9) performed DJ from <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> of 0. 30, 0. 45, and 0. 60 m). DJ performance was evaluated with DJ-index which was calculated from contact time and jump height. SICI was calculated from motor evoked potentials (MEP) recorded using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation for the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in 7 jump athletes. Significantly higher DJ performance was observed for the Jumper group at all <b>drop</b> <b>heights,</b> and the Jumper group exhibited greater performance for the highest <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> than the Other groups. Significant decreases in SICI for MG were observed for the Jumper groups, and this decrease in inhibition was more prominent for the highest <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> during pre-set. Furthermore, the correlation between SICI for MG and DJ-index was stronger for increased <b>drop</b> <b>heights,</b> and a significantly positive correlation between these variables was observed at a height of 0. 60 m. However, the SICI during the pre-set for TA exhibited no significant change under any of the conditions. The {{results of the present study}} suggest the importance of selective disinhibition of brain areas associated with the agonistic muscles during pre-set for higher DJ performance...|$|R

Multiple {{factors have been}} shown in isolation to affect landing mechanics and increase the risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries including gender, fatigue and <b>drop</b> jump <b>height.</b> However, there is {{a gap in the}} literature on the interaction of these factors. The purpose of the current research was to identify the combined effects of <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> and fatigue on landing mechanics in recreationally active females. Subjects participated in a muscular fatiguing protocol and a series of drop jumps from a range of heights before and after fatiguing exercises. Kinematic results from this study demonstrated that hip flexion decreased at initial contact, and knee flexion and hip flexion increased in the maximum position as <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> increased. As a result of fatigue, knee valgus in the maximum position increased along with vertical ground reaction forces and loading rate. These increased ground reaction forces were observed with <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> as well. Interaction effects were observed in the peak frontal plane ankle moment and frontal plane hip angle at impact suggesting that fatigue and <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> do have a combined effect on landing mechanics. Athletes and coaches can use this information to design optimal training and injury prevention programs by implementing various heights and states of fatigue in their training in order for the athlete to improve their landing mechanics in these high injury risk situations.

40|$|Particle packing is an {{important}} subject in scientific research and industrial applications. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been taken on particle packing, but mainly focusing on the packing of spheres. However, the investigations regarding packing of non-spherical particles are limited because {{of the complexity of}} the problem, like contact detection, overlap and force calculation. Therefore, recent studies mainly focused on well-defined shapes. Among these well-defined shapes, the ellipsoids are regarded as the first step from spherical to non-spherical particles. More importantly, ellipsoids can represent a wide range of shapes from very platy to elongated, including spheres. Therefore, ellipsoids with a range of aspect ratios are used in both physical experiments and DEM simulations. Through the combination of vibration and so-called batch-wised feeding method, it is expected to obtain local ordered packing structures of mono-sized spheres and ellipsoids, which is obviously important for the further investigation in the field of crystallization of particles. The equivalent packing size, which is defined as an equivalent spherical diameter determined by measuring and relating its size-dependent packing property to the diameter of a sphere, is quite significant in the characterisation of the size of non-spherical particles and can be used to estimate the packing density of packing including non-spherical particles. The investigation about the segregation caused due to particle shape and the underlying mechanism will be beneficial to the process control in many industries including handling particular materials. For the packing of mono-sized ellipsoids, both simulation and experimental results show the strong effects of some key variables on packing properties. Generally, increasing <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> can increase the packing density, overall mean coordination number, and result in more local ordered packing structures, while increasing deposition intensity, friction coefficient and damping coefficient can decrease the packing density, overall mean coordination number of the packing and cause the decrease of the local ordered packing structures. Furthermore, the analysis regarding the order parameter implies that oblate ellipsoids prefer facing upwards and downwards and the prolate ellipsoids tend to lie flat in the plane normal to the vertical direction based on the analysis of the distributions of angle between OA, which is defined the vector pointing from particle mass centre O to polar apex A of the ellipsoid, and z-axis. The equivalent packing size of ellipsoidal particles was confirmed from microscopic viewpoint based on the similarity between packing systems of spherical and non-spherical particles. And the similarity can be obtained from the analysis on the mean coordination number of each component in a given binary mixture of spheres and ellipsoids. Furthermore, the equivalent packing size was also demonstrated to be independent on the volume fraction of each component. The findings in this chapter indicate that the equivalent packing size can be used in the field of particle packing mainly because it is obtained from the analysis of coordination number. In other word, it is truly based on the interaction of particles and reflects the collective behaviour of particles. The packing of mono-sized spheres with three-dimensional vibrations was investigated experimentally. The results show that the ordered packing structures can be obtained if the vibration amplitude and frequency are controlled properly and batch-wised feeding is more beneficial for obtaining the ordered packing. Furthermore, the formation of an ordered structure serves as a template for the newly added particles. By adding one layer colourful particles, it can be found that the colourful particle only slightly diffuse near the wall, which indicates that the template is quite stable. Based on these results, the binary mixtures of spheres were also studied to obtain the maximum packing density under three-dimensional vibrations. The results shows the vibration condition, volume fraction, size ratio and feeding method all {{play a significant role in}} the densification process of binary mixtures of spheres. Vibration was also used to investigate the packing of binary mixtures of spheres and ellipsoids. The results indicate the effects of particle shape on variation of packing density and coordination number. Furthermore, segregation due to particle shape under one-dimensional vibration also shows the influence of particle shape. In both physical experiments and DEM simulations, significant convection is observed, which is considered as a responsible factor for the segregation observed. The results also indicate that it is easy for ellipsoids with small or large aspect ratios to enter the void near the wall, move downwards to the bottom of the container and to be trapped there...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} the Reactive Strength Index (RSI) and jump-height (JH) performance from multiple <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> in an elite population. Methods: Thirteen professional basketball players (mean ±SD age 25. 8 ± 3. 5 y, height 1. 96 ± 0. 07 m, mass 94. 8 ± 8. 2 kg) completed 3 maximal drop-jump attempts onto a jump mat at 4 randomly assigned box heights and 3 countermovement-jump trials. Results: No statistical difference was observed between 3 trials for both the RSI and JH variable at all the tested <b>drop</b> <b>heights.</b> The RSI for drop-jump heights from 20 cm resulted in a coefficient of variation (CV) = 3. 1 % and an intraclass correlation (ICC α) =. 96, 40 cm resulted in a CV = 3. 0 % and an ICC α =. 95, and 50 cm resulted in a CV = 2. 1 % and an ICC α =. 99. The JH variable at the 40 -cm drop-jump height resulted in the highest reliability CV = 2. 8 % and an ICC α =. 98. Conclusion: When assessing the RSI the 20 -, 40 -, and 50 -cm <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> are recommended with this population.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to compile and {{interpret}} <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> and <b>drop</b> frequencies data for small parcel packages moving through the Eastman Kodak Company global distribution network. The need for this study arose from the inclusion of <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> probability curves into Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s shipping tests for packaged product weighing less than 100 lb. Kodak packaging engineers suspected the <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> included in the probability curves were too high in <b>drop</b> <b>height</b> and too many in frequency when compared to the actual distribution environment. The data for this study resulted from dozens of test shipments using dummy-load packages throughout the Kodak global distribution network. The test shipments were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Australia. The test packages were equipped with a drop-height recording device called a SAVER to record when a drop occurred and from what height the package was dropped. Data from the recorder was downloaded, 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 events were sorted out from events that were not true drops. Once sorting was completed, the 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 data was analyzed utilizing various statistical techniques. The results of the analysis led to the development of data-derived statistical test plans based on the actual field-measured data. The results of this experiment, when compared to the probability curve currently in use, show that the <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> outlined in the probability curve are too high and too many are called for. This experiment will serve as the basis for new shipping tests based on actual field measurements. The field data indicates that the current test may have led to overtesting and overpackaging of our products.
