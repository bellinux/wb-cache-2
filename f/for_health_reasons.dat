5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O.

Allen resigned from his leadership of the West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E

5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for whatever reason, {{his or her}} seat will be filled by a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, {{will be replaced by}} a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b> Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{responded to}} the Tea Party with the Boston Port Act, one of the {{so-called}} Coercive Acts intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General Thomas Gage, who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts. Hancock did not serve in the first Congress, possibly <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons,</b> or possibly to remain in charge while the other Patriot leaders were away.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Confounding and {{interaction}} have differing {{implications for the}} interpretation of findings and the design of research, mental health services, and policy. This study aimed to verify whether the association between sex {{and the use of}} services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons</b> is confounded or modified by social anchorage. Methods: We undertook a case–control study nested in Cycle 1. 2 of the Canadian Community Health Survey. Cases were defined as users of general medical services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons</b> in the previous 12 months, and control subjects were defined as never-users of any services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b> The pattern of social anchorage was described by the roles of parent, spouse, worker, and their combination. Results: Overall, women are 2. 9 times {{more likely than men to}} use general services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b> However, this inequality between women and men decreases substantially or subsides in individuals who are less anchored to Canadian society. For instance, in single parents and in unemployed parents, the odds of using general services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons</b> are similar in women and in men. The pattern of social anchorage tends to modify, but not to confound, the association between sex and the use of services. Conclusions: Ignoring the interaction between sex and the pattern of social anchorage distorts the interpretation of the inequality between women and men in the use of general medical services <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>reasons</b> and may affect the design of comprehensive mental health services and policy.

5|$|Following {{the first}} Bayreuth Festival, Wagner {{began work on}} Parsifal, his final opera. The {{composition}} took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b> From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on {{the last of his}} documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival. Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing Parsifal, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the Siegfried Idyll) to the publisher Schott.|$|E

Unable <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons</b> to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Imogen {{spent most of the}} 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.

5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India {{to document the}} aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons,</b> in December 1859.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>reasons.</b> Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
