25|$|The children's show {{changed its}} name and target age group in 2005. TV Xuxa, which was still a daily morning show, {{included}} games, cartoons, contest, and musical numbers to amuse <b>kids</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>ages.</b> In 2008, TV Xuxa was reformulated {{to appeal to a}} wider audience and adopted a weekly talk show format that aired on Saturday mornings. The program stopped showing cartoons, and Xuxa began to receive her guests on a stage designed for interviews and musical numbers. On this stage, Xuxa talked with singers Justin Bieber (outside the studio, {{when he came to the}} show in Brazil), and Taylor Swift. In 2011, the show was moved to Saturday afternoons by Rede Globo.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews {{is one that}} charges the series {{with a lack of}} originality. Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone argued that the show is [...] "derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen." [...] Zeus took issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were [...] "ripped-off" [...] from other shows. Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today criticized the show for its plot complexity, constant action, and [...] "characters [...] can do just about anything." [...] McDonough stated that [...] "it's never clear whether P are intended to entertain children or are merely a reflection of grown-up animators engaged in a juvenile lark." [...] Marylin Moss of The Hollywood Reporter described Phineas and Ferb as [...] "Pretty mindless but <b>kids</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> might find a humorous moment in it." [...] Moss called the plot lines redundant but did praise the music styles and guest stars.|$|E

40|$|The current {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB) epidemic {{continues to be}} the predominant ongoing forest health issue in the state. In addition to ecological ramifications, MPB has affected safety, communities, infrastructure, wood products, recreation, tourism, water, the economy. It also has had an emotional effect. When mountains of red and dead trees are visible, the {{mountain pine}} beetle has a reputation for being an agent of destruction and devastation; however, the MPB is part of a natural cycle of our constantly changing forests. This is a hard concept to convey to audiences who have lived with tall, green trees for their entire lives. Most of the information available about MPB is contained in scientific papers and other publications. To teach people about MPB, A Year in the Life of a Mountain Pine Beetle, a cartoon story about Buford was developed. In this story, Buford explains his role in the ecosystem and the importance of forest management. Originally Buford was developed as a “kid’s book for adults” and was written at an adult level. However, <b>kids</b> and adults <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> have grown to love Buford. The book is now being used as a teaching aid in schools and outreach programs. It has expanded into a coloring book, and a subject for temporary tattoos, posters and power point presentations. Buford has become a great educational tool for teaching people <b>of</b> <b>all</b> audiences and <b>ages</b> about Colorado’s mountain pine beetle epidemic and the benefits of forest management...|$|R
