5|$|<b>Herpetic</b> keratoconjunctivitis, {{a primary}} infection, {{typically}} presents as {{swelling of the}} conjunctiva and eyelids (blepharoconjunctivitis), accompanied by small white itchy lesions {{on the surface of}} the cornea.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the use of}} acyclovir and valacyclovir {{in the treatment of}} herpes labialis as well as herpes infections in people with cancer. The evidence to support the use of acyclovir in primary <b>herpetic</b> gingivostomatitis is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary <b>herpetic</b> gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true <b>herpetic</b> ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: <b>herpetic</b> whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
25|$|An April 2013 Cochrane Collaboration {{meta-analysis}} of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral antiviral medications given within 72 {{hours after the}} onset of herpes zoster rash in immunocompetent people for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) found {{no significant difference between}} placebo and acyclovir. Combining four RCTs, 44.1% of the acyclovir treatment group developed <b>herpetic</b> neuralgia whereas 53.3% of the placebo group developed <b>herpetic</b> neuralgia. Heterogeneity between the four RCTs was moderate: Chi2 =3.36, df = 2 (P=0.19); I2 = 40%.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{aciclovir}} {{is effective}} to treat severe medical conditions caused by {{different species of}} the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of herpes virus, severe genital herpes, chickenpox and <b>herpetic</b> encephalitis. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum and Herpes simplex meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). <b>Herpetic</b> keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|What {{they found}} was that many <b>herpetic</b> areas {{representing}} the peripheral distribution of single roots or individual sections of the cord, corresponded closely with areas of referred pain from diseases of different internal organs. This led Head to conclude that irradiation of abnormal afferent impulses produces a state of excessive irritability in the grey matter of the dorsal horn at the level which they enter it. As a result of this, impulses from the skin that pass through it are exaggerated or disordered so that a stimulus that would not usually provoke a painful reaction does so.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of <b>herpetic</b> infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
500|$|Neonatal {{herpes simplex}} is a HSV {{infection}} in an infant. It {{is a rare}} but serious condition, usually caused by vertical transmission of HSV-1 or -2) from mother to newborn. During immunodeficiency, herpes simplex can cause unusual lesions in the skin. [...] One {{of the most striking}} is the appearance of clean linear erosions in skin creases, with the appearance of a knife cut. <b>Herpetic</b> sycosis is a recurrent or initial herpes simplex infection affecting primarily the hair follicles. Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpesvirus in patients with chronic atopic dermatitis may result in spread of herpes simples throughout the eczematous areas.|$|E
500|$|HSV {{infection}} causes several distinct medical disorders. [...] Common {{infection of}} the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (<b>herpetic</b> whitlow). [...] More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye (herpes keratitis), or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis). [...] People with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or people with AIDS, [...] are prone to severe complications from HSV infections. HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person.|$|E
500|$|Herpes is {{contracted}} {{through direct}} contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person. Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners; {{a person with a}} history of infection (HSV seropositive) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person. Herpes simplex virus 2 is [...] typically contracted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual, but can also be contracted by exposure to infected saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or the fluid from <b>herpetic</b> blisters. To infect a new individual, HSV travels through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas. Even microscopic abrasions on mucous membranes are sufficient to allow viral entry.|$|E
500|$|Primary {{orofacial}} herpes {{is readily}} identified by clinical examination {{of persons with}} no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute gingivitis. Adults with atypical presentation {{are more difficult to}} diagnose. Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of <b>herpetic</b> lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis. [...] When lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo, a bacterial infection. Common mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcer) also resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.|$|E
2500|$|Aciclovir is {{excreted}} in {{the breast}} milk, therefore {{it is recommended that}} caution should be used in breast-feeding women. [...] It has been shown in limited test studies that the nursing infant is exposed to approximately 0.3mg/kg/day following oral administration of aciclovir to the mother. If nursing mothers have <b>herpetic</b> lesions near or on the breast, breast-feeding should be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Herpes simplex viruses {{can affect}} areas of skin exposed to {{contact with an}} {{infected}} person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease) [...] An {{example of this is}} <b>herpetic</b> whitlow which is a herpes infection on the fingers. This was a common affliction of dental surgeons prior to the routine use of gloves when conducting treatment on patients.|$|E
2500|$|Many infections {{can cause}} oral {{ulceration}} (see table). The most common are {{herpes simplex virus}} (herpes labialis, primary <b>herpetic</b> gingivostomatitis), varicella zoster (chicken pox, shingles), and coxsackie A virus (hand, foot and mouth disease). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) creates immunodeficiencies which allow opportunistic infections or neoplasms to proliferate. Bacterial processes leading to ulceration {{can be caused by}} [...] Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis).|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescein sodium, {{the sodium}} salt of fluorescein, is used {{extensively}} as a diagnostic tool {{in the field of}} ophthalmology and optometry, where topical fluorescein is used in the diagnosis of corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers and <b>herpetic</b> corneal infections. [...] It is also used in rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting to evaluate the tear layer under the lens. It is available as sterile single-use sachets containing lint-free paper applicators soaked in fluorescein sodium.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of {{herpes simplex}} virus {{infection}} include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips, nose or genitals. Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of <b>herpetic</b> disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, they can also cause more troublesome forms of herpes simplex. As neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience [...] episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores. It {{is one of the}} most common sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
2500|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} (also termed recurrent aphthous stomatits, RAS, and {{commonly called}} [...] "canker sores") {{is a very}} common cause of oral ulceration. 10–25% {{of the general population}} suffer from this non-contagious condition. The appearance of aphthous stomatitis varies as there are 3 types, namely minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthous ulceration and herpetiform ulceration. Minor aphthous ulceration is the most common type, presenting with 1–6 small (2-4mm diameter), round/oval ulcers with a yellow-grey color and an erythematous (red) [...] "halo". These ulcers heal with no permanent scarring in about 7–10days. Ulcers recur at intervals of about 1–4months. Major aphthous ulceration is less common than the minor type, but produces more severe lesions and symptoms. Major aphthous ulceration presents with larger (>1cm diameter) ulcers that take much longer to heal (10–40days) and may leave scarring. The minor and major subtypes of aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions on the non-keratinized oral mucosa (i.e. the inside of the cheeks, lips, underneath the tongue and the floor of mouth), but less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur {{in other parts of the}} mouth on keratinized mucosal surfaces. The least common type is herpetiform ulceration, so named because the condition resembles primary <b>herpetic</b> gingivostomatitis. Herpetiform ulcers begin as small blisters (vesicles) which break down into 2-3mm sized ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers appear in [...] "crops" [...] sometimes hundreds in number, which can coalesce to form larger areas of ulceration. This subtype may cause extreme pain, heals with scarring and may recur frequently.|$|E
