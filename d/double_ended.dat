25|$|The {{suburban}} trolley lines use Kawasaki-built vehicles similar to, but larger than, the Subway-Surface trolleys. They use {{a slightly}} wider Pennsylvania trolley gauge, 5' 2-1/2". Notably, they are <b>double</b> <b>ended,</b> unlike the Subway-Surface trolleys, as the suburban lines lack any loops {{to turn the}} vehicles on their suburban-bound termini.|$|E

25|$|Mason's {{idea was}} to remove what American {{railroad}} men saw as the biggest disadvantages of the Fairlie - its cramped space for fuel and water caused by its <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> design (not very useful on American railroads where there was always ample room for a turntable or wye), its cramped cab caused by the joined double boilers, {{and to some degree}} its poor riding.|$|E
25|$|NIR {{retained}} one Class 80 unit (three power {{cars and}} two driving trailers) as its sandite train during the 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 leaf fall seasons. It was planned that a Class 450 unit {{was to be}} used for this role. However, in 2015, Translink awarded a contract to Windhoff Bahn AG to procure a new <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> multi-purpose vehicle to undertake sandite and high-pressure water spraying, as well as weed killing operations.|$|E
25|$|There are 28 {{single ended}} cars in {{operation}} on the Powell lines and 12 <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> cars in operation on the California Street line. The cable cars are occasionally replaced with new or restored cars, {{with the old}} cars being moved to storage for later restoration. There are 2 cable cars in storage in the cable car museum / power house inside the garage, car numbers 19 and 42 which were used on the Sacramento-Clay and O'Farrell, Jones and Hyde Street lines, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The New South Wales Government Railways placed {{orders for}} five diesel power vans with Eveleigh Carriage Workshops and 12 trailer cars with Ritchie Brothers, Auburn in the mid-1930s. The <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> power cars were each fitted with two Harland & Wolff Hardlandic diesel engines. One was {{destroyed}} by fire at Ivanhoe in January 1950 with the remaining four repowered with General Motors 6-110 engines between 1952 and 1957. Another was withdrawn after being struck at a level crossing at Forbes in August 1982. The carriages were the first in Australia to feature air-conditioning.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the Macedonian cavalry was the xyston, a <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> cornel-wood lance, {{with a sword}} as a {{secondary}} weapon. From descriptions of combat, {{it would appear that}} once in melee the Companion cavalryman used his lance to thrust at the chests and faces of the enemy. It is possible that the lance was aimed at the upper body of an opposing cavalryman in the expectation that a blow which did not wound or kill might have sufficient leverage to unseat. If the lance broke, the Companion could reverse it and use the other end, or draw his sword. Cleitus, an officer of the Companions, saved Alexander the Great's life at the Granicus by cutting off an enemy horseman's arm with his sword. Companion cavalrymen would normally have worn armour and a helmet in battle.|$|E
25|$|The reverse stern, reverse {{transom stern}}, sugar-scoop, or retroussé stern {{is a kind}} of transom stern that is raked {{backwards}} (common on modern yachts, rare on vessels before the 20th century); the vertical transom stern or plumb stern is raked neither forward nor back, but falls directly from the taffrail down to the wing transom. The rocket ship stern is a term for an extremely angled retroussé stern. A <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> ship with a very narrow square counter formed from the bulwarks or upper deck above the head of the rudder is said to have a pink stern or pinky stern. The torpedo stern or torpedo-boat stern describes a kind of stern with a low rounded shape that is nearly flat at the waterline, but which then slopes upward in a conical fashion towards the deck (practical for small high-speed power boats with very shallow drafts).|$|E

25|$|A modest profit {{was made}} in 1871, {{following}} serious losses in the previous two years. The building of locomotives to Robert Fairlie's patent started {{at the end of}} that year. Between 1872 and 1883, thirteen were supplied to the Mexican Railway in three batches. They were 0-6-6-0 <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> machines, and the middle batch had Walschaerts valve gear, believed to be the first time that this design was built in Britain. The Mexican locomotives were capable of burning coal or wood as a fuel, while two supplied to Sweden burnt peat. The peat burners were not a success and were rebuilt at four 2-4-0 saddle tanks. An order for ten Fairlies received in 1873 for nitrate railways in Peru were built, but were not shipped because payment was not received. Four went to the Trancaucasian Railway near the Black Sea, and six were eventually shipped to a new Nitrate Railway Company in 1882. They had a 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement, and at 85 tons each, Engineering reported that they were the heaviest locomotives in the world in 1885.|$|E

500|$|As {{with all}} German battlecruisers {{that had been}} built, the Ersatz Yorck-class ships would have been {{equipped}} with four sets of Parsons turbine engines, each of which drove a 3-bladed screw that was [...] in diameter. The turbines were supplied with steam by 24 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft single ended boilers and 8 oil-fired Schulz-Thornycroft <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> boilers. Ersatz Yorck and Ersatz Gneisenau were intended to use Föttinger fluid transmission for their turbines, while Ersatz Scharnhorsts turbines retained direct coupled geared transmissions. The ships were to have electrical power provided by diesel generators. The Ersatz Yorcks were intended to mount a pair of twin rudders alongside each other for steering.|$|E
500|$|Peat {{was more}} {{absorbent}} than straw, and {{as there were}} huge numbers of working horses at the time, it was promoted {{as a replacement for}} straw. It could also be used for packing of fruit, as a replacement for sandbags, for fertiliser and as potting compost, as well as the manufacture of paraffin, creosote and tar. The owners of Thorne and Hatfield Moors leased their lands to peat companies, whose workers would dig drains, cut the turves, and stack them up to allow them to dry, so that they were ready for sale. The product was in competition with imports from the Netherlands, and the Dutch Griendtsveen Company set up the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company in 1893, a holding company which would buy up companies operating in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. The works at Moorends kept its ledgers in Dutch and English, and a number of Dutch workers relocated to Thorne. By 1899, there were some 120 Dutch workers, forming a community of 300 with their wives and children, and there was concern among local people that they would lose their own jobs. Dutch tools and working practices were introduced, and the immigrants cut around [...] of canals to transport peat to the mill at Moorends. The iron barges used on the canals were [...] long, and were <b>double</b> <b>ended,</b> as they could not be turned round. A total of twelve were built in the Netherlands, and remained in use until 1922, when Moorends Mill burnt down. The barges were cut up, and the mill was not rebuilt, although some of the other buildings were used as workhops until 1956.|$|E
