50|$|Morley {{railway station}} {{does not have}} a ticket office; {{passengers}} are able to purchase tickets on the train from the conductor or on the platform in the morning from station staff with portable ticket machines. This would otherwise present a problem at peak times, as one person cannot possibly sell tickets to every passenger on a crowded train; passengers travelling into Leeds therefore would have to queue up at the <b>excess</b> <b>fares</b> kiosk in Leeds to purchase tickets on arrival, in order to pass through the ticket barriers. It is, however, possible to buy tickets to or from Morley in the usual way at any manned station, with the nearest manned stations being Dewsbury and Leeds. It is also possible to buy tickets in advance online; however, there is no facility to collect pre-purchased tickets at Morley, and opting to have tickets mailed may incur an additional charge.|$|R

40|$|Under modern {{circumstances}} {{the process}} of effective incentive system of the labor activity foundation, which provides competitive advantages in using workforce, becomes {{one of the most}} important condition of Ukrainian enterprises’ performance growth. But the efficiency of this system mostly depends on the adequate usage of the financial incentives set in real economic conditions. Currently there is almost no ready-made matrix which will be focused precisely on the variable part of the salary. Using such a system in the future gives an opportunity to form and use wage incentive function more effectively. Investigation of the stimulating factors in the labor activity incentive system, which have been grouped according to the degree of influence on the variable part of the salary formation, is the main goal of this article. The subject of the research is incentives matrix. The methods of the research are: method of theoretical analysis, method of scientific literature analysis, and ranking method. One of the most important stages of incentive indicators modeling is to identify indicators, which can potentially affect the growth of stimulation fund. A set of indicators has been chosen due to the economic literature analysis, collective agreements, sectoral and regional agreements. The process of formation has been held by the analysis of different types of bonuses, allowances and <b>excess</b> <b>fares</b> which are common and widely used at Ukrainian industrial enterprises. Due to the analysis of possible causes of the material compensation 28 incentive indicators were selected. The next step of complex system incentive indicators formation is the composition of expert table with indicators. According to the results of the investigation the next groups of indicators have been allocated: indicators of direct influence (9 references and more); indicators of partial influence (5 – 8 references); indicators of possible influence (4 references and less). So, the first group appropriately will contain such incentives indicators, that have the most strong influence on the formation of the motivating part of payroll at Ukrainian industrial enterprises. To the group of indicators of partial influence according to the produced analysis one can refer such indicators which level of influence is temporary. The indicators of possible influence have been characterized by the minimum weight during the accumulation of the financial incentives fund. So, for the most effective implementation and usage of stimulating algorithm at Ukrainian enterprises, taking into account the conditions of incentive system improvement, the most proper indicators of the enterprise’s activity should be emphasized and taken as the key performance indicators of calculating the level of incentive payments and rewards...|$|R

40|$|D. Comm. Many {{studies on}} the topic of air {{transport}} deregulation have seen the light in the past two decades, and only more recently (in the early 1990 s) has this trend had its impact on the South African domestic air transport industry. For a period of almost 41 years (from 1949 until 1990), domestic air services on major routes in South Africa were strictly regulated by Government through the Air Services Act, No 51 of 1949. The above is the result of air transport policy that came into being {{in the early days of}} air transport and remained in place until the late 1980 s. Only after the adoption of a policy of deregulation did air transport policy adjust to allow for the entry of the private sector into the domestic air transport market as from 1990 onwards. In his study titled "Control Over Domestic Air Transportation in South Africa - A Historic Perspective"(1996), Mr J Vermooten describes the history of air transport in South Africa as follows: In the period 1929 to 1934, the following airlines were responsible for establishing scheduled domestic air services in South Africa: - Union Airways; South West African Airways (Junkers); Imperial Airways; and Rhodesian and Nyasaland Airways. All of the above airlines, except the last-mentioned, relied heavily on air mail subsidy agreements from Government enabling them to operate scheduled services in South Africa. Chapter 1 - 2 Over time, the South African Railways and Harbours Administration (SAR&H) became concerned about the threat of intermodal competition from air services and the possible diversionary effect on its first class rail passenger traffic. This eventually resulted in the protection of railway services against competition from air transport, similar - to the protection against competition from motor transportation. The provision of air transport services was fortunately not completely banned. Instead, departmental air services were introduced through the purchase of Union Airways by the South African Railways in February 1934. This was followed by the purchase of South West African Airways a year later (February 1935). At the start of the Second World War (1939 / 1940), aircraft employed for civil air transport were transferred to military authorities and South Africa became totally dependent on foreign airlines for the provision of domestic air transport services. These services were provided by: the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC); Society Anonyme Beige d'Esploration de la Navigation Aerienne (SABENA) and Southern Rhodesia Air Services (SRAS), which succeeded the old Rhodesia and Nyasaland Airways (RANA). Domestic Air Services by foreign airlines were provided at very reasonable prices during the war, but fares were increased by between 25 % and 38 % when South African Airways (SAA) resumed its domestic services after the war. The economic conditions immediately after the Second World War could not support the levels of fares and tariffs introduced with the resumption of services by SAA. To rescue the situation, SAA's domestic <b>fares,</b> <b>excess</b> luggage and freight rates were restored to 1941 -levels on 1 March 1946. Chapter 1 - 3 In response to the need of Municipalities to clarify their position with regard to airports and feeder services, the South African Government introduced an air transport policy that reserved the major domestic air transport services for SAA, leaving it to the private sector to participate in the provision of feeder air services. The policy also made provision for various categories of airports and degrees of financial assistance by the Government, thereby limiting the demands by Municipalities for the increased use of airports. The National Transport Commission (NTC) was established in terms of the Transport Co-ordination Act of 1948, in order to replace the Civil Aviation Council. The Council was responsible for the technical issues related to air transport, such as the competency of air personnel, airworthiness of aircraft, the provision of facilities in the interest of safety, etc. The Transport Co-ordination Act charged the NTC with the following tasks: " [...] . (to) promote and encourage the development of transport in the Union and, where necessary, co-ordinate various phases of transport in order to achieve the maximum benefit and economy of transport services to the public. " The Act also led to the protection of SAA - similar to the protection of railway services provided by the SAR&H. The Air Services Act of 1949 formally introduced the concept of economic regulation of air transport services in South Africa and in 1952 the NTC formulated a comprehensive air transport policy which ensured the establishment of a monopoly for SAA over the majority of air transport services in the domestic market until 1991. Following on what was said above, the Air Services Act (No 51 of 1949) provided for the licensing and control of airlines and air services and stipulated that, subject to certain exceptions, no one was allowed to use an aircraft for commercial purposes, unless a licence to do so has been granted by the NTC (section 2 of the Act). In terms of section 10 of the Act, the NTC was prohibited from granting a licence in competition with an existing licence, if the service provided by the existing licensee was "satisfactory and sufficient" to meet the needs of the public at a "reasonable charge". To summarise, one can say that prior to the establishment of SAA a very liberal air transport policy existed, whilst after its establishment air transport policy was protectionist in nature. The "interest of the public" in the provision of air transport services was generally regarded as the interest of the SAR&H - rather than the users directly affected by the air service. It is also remarkable that foreign airlines played such an important role in the development and maintenance of domestic air services in South Africa in the very early days of air transport in this country, as well as during the Second World War at which time the civil air services provided by SAA were terminated due to support for military needs. Since the establishment of the national carrier, SAA, by the SAR&H, air transport in South Africa was subject to the protection of the Government and as a result, SAA obtained a monopoly in the provision of domestic air transport services. The SAR&H was succeeded by the South African Transport Services (SATS) and in 1988, the South African transport industry moved a step closer towards the deregulation and privatisation of State-owned transport enterprises, with the restructuring of SATS and its predecessor, the SAR&H which has played the role of "Big Brother" in the industry since South Africa became a Union in 1910...|$|R
