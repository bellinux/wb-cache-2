25|$|Washington, D.C., {{the capital}} of the United States, was planned under French-American {{architect}} Pierre Charles L'Enfant. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original District of Columbia was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously Pennsylvania Avenue. These diagonals are often connected by traffic circles, such as Dupont Circle and Washington Circle. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the McMillan Plan, led by Senator James McMillan, was adopted to build a National Mall and a parks system that is still today a <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

It consists of numerous lengthy walking and cycling trails along Four Pole Creek, which runs {{the entire length of}} the park and is crossed by many wooden and stone footbridges.There are also restroom facilities, picnic tables, a shelter with grills and electrical outlets, a children's playground, an amphitheater for small concerts and plays, an award-winning rose garden, and a new dog park.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{wielding}} {{such power}} over the king, Diane's status depended on the king's welfare and remaining in power. In 1559, when Henry was critically wounded in a jousting tournament, Queen Catherine assumed control, restricting access to him. Although the king was alleged to have called out repeatedly for Diane, she was never summoned or admitted, and after his death, she was also not invited to the funeral. Immediately thereafter, Diane was obliged to give to Catherine the Château de Chenonceau, the <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loire Renaissance palaces, in exchange for Catherine's Château de Chaumont, which Catherine used for her sorcery before her widowhood. Diane stayed there only a short time, and she lived out her remaining years in her château in Anet, Eure-et-Loir, where she lived in comfortable obscurity as a virtual exile..|$|E
25|$|The {{school and}} the museum also served for over half a century as a popular meeting place on feast days for the wider Polish community. Indeed, it became a {{destination}} for the Polish diaspora in that it led Prince Stanisław Albrecht Radziwiłł (husband of Lee Bouvier-Radziwill, younger sister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) to fund the erection of St.Anne's church in the grounds and a burial place for his mother and other family members. The church in striking modernist style, reminiscent of Zakopane Style architecture, was commissioned from Polish architect, Władysław Jarosz, from the architectural practice, Crabtree and Jarosz and completed in 1971. It is Grade II listed by English Heritage. He died in 1976 and was himself interred in the church's crypt, so confident had he been of the Polish commitment to this <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English countryside.|$|E

25|$|To reach a final {{conclusion}} on {{the choice}} for ruler Winston Churchill, then British colonial secretary, summoned {{a small group}} of Orientalists to Egypt for the famous Cairo Conference of March 1921. The British Empire’s best minds on the Middle East would determine the fate of Mesopotamia, Transjordan and Palestine. Churchill’s objectives were to save money by reducing Britain's overseas military presence; Find a way to maintain political control over Britain's mandate areas as identified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement; Protect what was then suspected to be substantial oil reserves in Iraq; and lastly preserve an open trade route to India, the Crown <b>Jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire. Representing the Iraqis, two members of the Council were picked to join the delegation: Sassoon Eskell and Jafar Pasha al-Askari; with the disliked Sayid Talib left behind.

25|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 18th century Cuba had been the crown <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish colonial empire. In the late 19th century, Cuban {{nationalist}} revolutionaries rebelled against Spanish dominance, resulting in three liberation wars: the Ten Years' War (1868–1878), the Little War (1879–1880) and the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). The United States government proclaimed war on the Spanish Empire, resulting in the Spanish–American War (1898). The US subsequently invaded the island, and forced the Spanish army out. On 20 May 1902, a new independent government proclaimed the foundation of the Republic of Cuba, with US Military governor Leonard Wood handing over control to President Tomás Estrada Palma, a Cuban-born US citizen. Subsequently, large numbers of US settlers and businessmen arrived in Cuba, and by 1905, 60% of rural properties were owned by non-Cuban North Americans. Between 1906 and 1909, 5,000 US Marines were stationed across the island, and returned in 1912, 1917 and 1921 to intervene in internal affairs, sometimes {{at the behest of the}} Cuban government.|$|E

Because of the paucity of new Beatles music, AllMusic's Unterberger and Bruce Eder suggest the album might be [...] "inessential" [...] but for Harrison's [...] "It's All Too Much": [...] "the <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new songs... resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar... a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia".|$|E
500|$|In December, King Frederick II of Prussia {{invaded the}} Duchy of Silesia and {{requested}} that Maria Theresa cede it, threatening {{to join her}} enemies if she refused. Maria Theresa decided {{to fight for the}} mineral-rich province. Frederick even offered a compromise: he would defend Maria Theresa's rights if she agreed to cede to him at least a part of Silesia. Francis Stephen was inclined to consider such an arrangement, but the Queen and her advisers were not, fearing that any violation of the Pragmatic Sanction would invalidate the entire document. Maria Theresa's firmness soon assured Francis Stephen that they should fight for Silesia, and she was confident that she would retain [...] "the <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Austria". The resulting war with Prussia is known as the First Silesian War. The invasion of Silesia by Frederick was the start of a lifelong enmity; she referred to him as [...] "that evil man".|$|E
500|$|Sébastien Mitton, {{who acted}} as art {{director}} {{on the first}} game, returned to the position for Dishonored 2. Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of Dishonoreds [...] "painterly" [...] look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved {{in the art of}} Dishonored 2. Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts. The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, [...] "the <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south". The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt [...] "we need to start it at home ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back". Mitton wanted Dishonored 2 to be a visual [...] "journey to a new city", though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like oppression, disease, magic, and decay.|$|E

500|$|Although Victorian {{painting}} styles {{went out}} of fashion soon after Watts's death, Hope has remained extremely influential. Mark Bills, curator of the Watts Gallery, described Hope as [...] "the most famous and influential" [...] of all Watts's paintings and [...] "a <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late nineteenth-century Symbolist movement". In 1889 socialist agitator John Burns visited Samuel and Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel, and [...] saw a photograph of Hope among their possessions. After Henrietta explained its significance to him, efforts {{were made by the}} coalition of workers' groups which were to become the Labour Party to recruit Watts. Although determined to stay outside of politics, Watts wrote in support of striking busmen in 1891, and in 1895 donated a chalk reproduction of Hope to the Missions to Seamen in Poplar in support of London dock workers. (This {{is believed to be the}} red chalk version of Hope now in the Watts Gallery.) The passivity of Watts's depiction of Hope drew criticism from some within the socialist movement, who saw her as embodying an unwillingness to commit to action. The prominent art critic Charles Lewis Hind also loathed this passivity, writing in 1902 that [...] "It is not a work that the robust admire, but the solitary and the sad find comfort in it. It reflects the pretty, pitiable, forlorn hope of those who are cursed with a low vitality, and poor physical health".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot {{admired the}} song, saying: [...] "once again, a raga-flavored groove brings out Harrison's {{best in the}} walloping 'It's All Too Much.'" [...] That same year, Nigel Williamson of Uncut {{described}} it as [...] "a psychedelic classic" [...] that, had it been recorded earlier in 1967, [...] "would have made Sgt Pepper an even better album". In the fourth edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "Yellow Submarine was a flat soundtrack rather than a real album, but here's a question: Why is George's 'It's All Too Much' not heralded {{as one of the}} top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history?" [...] Sheffield features the track in his 2017 book Dreaming the Beatles, where he refers to it as [...] "the great lost Beatle song – the one that deserves to be infinitely more famous than it is", adding: [...] "It's where they really nailed the Sgt. Pepper sound – that combination of acid-rock momentum and brass-band frippery. 'It's All Too Much' would have been the second or third best song on Sgt. Pepper ..." [...] Richie Unterberger of AllMusic similarly considers Yellow Submarine to be [...] "inessential" [...] and describes the track as [...] "the <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new songs... resplendent in swirling , larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar" [...] and [...] "a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia".|$|E
500|$|In 1923, in {{collaboration}} with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though {{at first it was}} a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: [...] "Drivel That They Paid to Hear". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of [...] "relentless cacophony". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as [...] "harmless". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: [...] "The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention." [...] In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, [...] "as a musical joker he is a <b>jewel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first water". Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance. The players did not like the music: the clarinettist, Charles Draper asked the composer, [...] "Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?" [...] Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular Façade ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.|$|E
