5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her first <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault. Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|E

25|$|Haneef's legal {{advisers}} {{have challenged}} the Government {{to release the}} full record of the second police <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> they believe the public is entitled to judge for themselves whether the explanations given by Haneef in relation to these conversations are worthy of suspicion. His legal advisers have {{also pointed out that}} the material referred to by the Minister was available to the magistrate when she made her bail decision on 16 July and to the Director of Public Prosecutions when he decided to drop charges on 27 July. The Minister claims that these prior tests of the material are not relevant to his decision since, by the terms of the Act, he is not required to prove his suspicions beyond reasonable doubt. The Act also specifically exempts the Minister from the requirement to ensure his decisions comply with the principles of natural justice.|$|E

25|$|On November 12, 2010, Rodríguez was {{involved}} in an incident where a pickup truck was partially damaged. He and a companion were burned, being initially attended {{at a hospital in}} Vega Baja, before both were transferred to the specialized burn care unit of Centro Médico in San Juan, where he was placed in preventive intubation to ease the stress on his lungs. Rodríguez suffered second degree burns in approximately 66% of his body, most of the damage focusing in his back and legs. Due to the incident, Rodríguez was removed from a scheduled dual, but was kept among the recipients of a grant issued by the COPUR. By late December he was already training two to three days per week, while admitted in the burn unit and still wearing bandages around one of his arms and both legs. His trainer, Orlando Rodríguez, noted that {{this was the first time}} that he worked with a pugilist while still recovering in a hospital. Consequently, a special regime was prepared to work on his footwork, speed and strength, while including other standard practices such as shadow boxing and pads. In his first <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> the incident, Rodríguez noted that he intended to focus on his career and education from that point onwards, severing ties with any negative influence. The following week, the possibility of infection was dismissed by the medical personnel, who allowed more contact with external items, including haircutting tools. Upon being released, the original plan was to participate in the qualification of the 2011 Pan American Games, but he received a negative report from Enrique Amy, chief doctor of the COPUR's Anti-Doping Commission. The amateur boxing federation followed the recommendation. Consequently, Rodríguez spent several months of additional recovery, focused on treatment to avoid re-injuring or infecting the scar tissue in his left arm.|$|E

In Jackson's first <b>interview</b> <b>since</b> 1993 and Presley's first ever, Diane Sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with, according to Jet, a series of [...] "insensitive" [...] questions.

The following day, Presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster; she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious, yet Jackson fooled around during the show, at one point holding two fingers behind his wife's head to make bunny ears. Presley's friend Monica Pastelle revealed that it was at this point that Presley began to wonder whether she had made a mistake in choosing Jackson as a long-term partner.|$|E
