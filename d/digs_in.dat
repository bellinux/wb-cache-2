The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological <b>digs</b> <b>in</b> the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E

5|$|When Cope {{arrived back}} in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological <b>digs</b> <b>in</b> the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E

25|$|From the Holy Roman Empire, {{the monk}} Ansgar (801–865) began the {{earliest}} campaign to introduce Christianity to Sweden. Ansgar {{made his first}} visit to Birka in 829, was granted permission to build a church, and stayed as a missionary until 831. He then returned home and became Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Around 850, he returned to Birka, where he saw that the previous congregation had faded away. Ansgar tried to re-establish it, but it only lasted a few years. However, archaeological <b>digs</b> <b>in</b> Varnhem found a Christian burial ground established in the late 9th century. On the same spot, a stone church was built in the early-11th century, and a short distance away, Varnhem Abbey was established in the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} also {{opened its}} grounds to archeological <b>digs</b> <b>in</b> 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go {{back as far}} as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.|$|E
