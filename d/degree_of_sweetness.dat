6000|$|An {{interesting}} illustration, in late years, of {{the operation}} of a [...] discriminating duty {{is to be found}} in the case of different grades [...] of sugar imported into the United States. Our tariff levied [...] certain duties on different grades of sugar classified by color, [...] on the theory that color was a test of saccharine strength. [...] Cargoes were examined and compared with graded sugars hermetically [...] sealed in glass bottles and distributed by the Dutch authorities, [...] whence came the name of “Dutch standard.” Grades from No. 1 [...] (melado) to No. 10 must go to the refiner before consumption; but [...] the grades to No. 13, although some might have gone into immediate [...] consumption, were usually sent to be manufactured into the highest [...] grades of soft and hard sugars. So long as the sugar was secured [...] by evaporation in open coppers, or by passing the molasses through [...] a layer of clay, saccharine strength and color went fairly well [...] together. But with the invention of the vacuum-pan and the [...] centrifugal wheel, by which the sugar is reduced through a shorter [...] and more effective process, sugar of a certain grade of color by [...] the Dutch standard contained a much greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> [...] than that produced by the old methods. Cuban planters, therefore, [...] were permitted to send sugar into this country at a duty which was [...] really levied on grades much inferior, and so paid a less duty [...] than other sugars. The products of one country were discriminated [...] against in favor of another. The difficulty was settled by using [...] the polariscope, which gave an absolute chemical test of the [...] sweetness, irrespective of color.|$|E

40|$|Importance of problem: The {{ice cream}} {{industry}} continually faces {{the problem of}} improving its frozen desserts. At the present time corn syrup solids {{are being used to}} supplement milk serum solids to improve the body and texture of these products. One of the problems is to increase the total solids content of frozen desserts without increasing sweetness or developing sandiness in the finished product. There is a limit to the amount of milk serum solids that can be used because of the danger of sandiness and the cost. The use of corn syrup solids helps to overcome these limiting factors. The corn syrup solids product now used contains a dextrose equivalent of 42. The corn products manufacturers are beginning to make a product with different dextrose equivalents with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> Modifications <b>of</b> DE 42 contain dextrose equivalents of 24 and 31 and will add corn syrup solids of different dextrose equivalents or <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> to these frozen desserts. Robert L. Lloyd defines dextrose equivalent as follows: The percentage of reducing sugars present on a dry basis indicates the degree to which conversion has been carried in the hydrolysis of starch. Dextrose has a DE of 100 and is used as the standard. The lower the dextrose equivalent of a product the less the sweetening power. Purpose of problem: 1. To determine the optimun amounts of corn syrup solids to use in building body and texture in frozen desserts without impairing flavor. 2.

A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera captured images of the sensor array from 23 different white wine samples, and {{the change in the}} R, G, B color components from the control were analyzed by principal component analysis. Additionally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the chemical components of each wine sample responsible for its taste. A two-dimensional score plot was created with 23 data points. It revealed clusters created from the same type of grape, and trends of sweetness, sourness, and astringency were mapped. An artificial neural network model was developed to predict the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness,</b> sourness, and astringency of the white wines. The coefficients of determination (R 2) for the HPLC results and the sweetness, sourness, and astringency were 0. 96, 0. 95, and 0. 83, respectively.

40|$|Stevia glycosides, {{extracted}} from {{the leaves of the}} plant Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, display an amazing high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> As processed plant products, they are considered as excellent bio-alternatives for sucrose and artificial sweeteners.

These undesirable properties may be reduced or eliminated by modifying the carbohydrate moieties of the steviol glycosides. A promising procedure is to subject steviol glycosides to enzymatic glycosylation, thereby introducing additional monosaccharide residues into the molecules. Depending on the number and positions of the monosaccharide units, the taste quality and sweetness potency of the compounds will vary.

40|$|Polyol-containing {{confectionery}} offers considerable {{advantages over}} traditional sucrose-based confectionery {{in terms of}} reduced energy content and reduced cariogenicity. However, overconsumption of polyol confectionery may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms in some individuals. Rather than consider this as a distinct disadvantage to the consumer, this article discusses how careful consideration of the physico-chemical properties of polyols and advances in product development and formulation can provide suitable polyol-based products for the consumer. Furthermore, food legislation and ingredient pricing issues {{are just some of}} the factors that must be taken into account when designing new polyol-containing products if their functional benefits and good product quality are to be delivered to the consumer. Polyols: Sucrose: Confectionery: Sugar free Sugar confectionery has been developed over the centuries with increasing sophistication and it exists in countless formats with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness,</b> flavours and aromas, textures and mouthfeel. Confectionery serves a very simple purpose; the rush <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> coupled with pleasant flavours, aromas and mouthfeel provokes an almost instantaneous feeling of well-being and happiness (Lees & Jackson, 1985; Jackson, 1990). Sugar confectionery by definition is meant to include products that contain predominantly one form or another of the following sugars: sucrose (usually cane or beet sugar); dextrose (otherwise known as glucose, usually corn sugar); fructose (often referred to a fruit sugar) or lactose (otherwise known as milk sugar). The different categories of sugar confectionery are shown in Table 1. Because sucrose and glucose are relatively cheap and abundant, confectionery is readily available to the consumer. Thus, overconsumption of confectionery may lead to an excess intake of sugar, fat and energy which are implicated in the aetiology of dental caries, obesity and metabolic diseases associated with obesity (Department o...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the changes in the activity of pectinases (pectinesterase and polygalacturonase), dietary fiber content (alcohol-insoluble solids, pectin, and total fiber), and physicochemical indices related to the flavor (pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, Brix/acid ratio, and reducing and nonreducing sugars) of cubiu fruits (Solanum sessiliflorum Dunal) at different stages of ripening (green, turning, ripe, and fully ripe). Alcohol-insoluble solids and pectin were very similar, with the highest levels detected at the green and turning stages, and the lowest levels occurring at the fully ripe stage. The amount of total fiber was consistent at the green, turning, and ripe stages, but declined at the fully ripe stage. These changes correlated with the pectinase activities, the profiles of which resembled those of other species of the Solanaceae family during fruit ripening. However, cubiu fruits were significant sources of dietary fiber at all stages. The reducing sugar content reached the highest level at the turning stage, with glucose as the major sugar. The content of nonreducing sugars, such as sucrose, remained low at all stages. The other physicochemical indices displayed increases during ripening, characterizing cubiu as a very acidic fruit with a small <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> ...|$|E

This study examined the differences in the sweetness of the strawberry flavoured yoghurt with the addition of sucrose, stevia and equal portions of sucrose and stevia; each combination was used at three different concentrations (3, 4. 5 and 6 % / 100 g yoghurt). Stevia was diluted in a concentration which, according to the literature, matches the sweetness profile of sucrose. Viscosity of the yoghurts was determined by the rheometer, and sensory profiling of the products was evaluated by a panel using the ranking test and weighted factors methods.

Scott SmithNon-nutritive {{sweeteners}} are alternative sweeteners {{that provide}} the taste <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> without a caloric contribution. In this Florence’s HomeStyle Cha-Cha study, aspartame, acesulfame K, sodium saccharin, and neotame were evaluated {{as a substitute for}} sucrose in the formulation. These sweeteners were used at their recommended equivalency levels to match the sweetness potency level to that of sucrose. Because they are more potent than sucrose, minimum amounts were needed to replace sucrose, and the remaining amounts were filled with maltodextrin. Using maltodextrin as bulk filler is common practice in the industry when replacing sucrose with a non-nutritive sweetener. This study evaluated the quality of the finished product in determining which non-nutritive sweetener had similar taste, aroma, and density qualities as the control, which was Cha-Cha sweetened with sucrose. The results of the evaluations indicated that Cha-Cha sweetened with acesulfame K was more similar to the control than the other non-nutritive sweeteners. Of the three taste characteristics evaluated for their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> intensity, <b>sweetness,</b> saltiness, and bitterness, the acesulfame K sweetened treatment was closer to the control. In the GC/MS analysis in characterizing the volatile aroma compounds, acesulfame K contained all the aroma compounds with smaller differences in concentration than the other experimental treatments.

Eggurt was prepared by fermented milk and albumen inoculated with 5 % Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophillus (1 : 1) and incubated at 42 °C to form a curd or the pH reached 4. 5. Milk and albumen were pasteurized separately. Milk was pasteurized at temperature of 85 °C for 30 minutes, while the albumen was pasteurized at temperature of 63 °C for 5 minutes. Dried eggurt was produced by mixing of eggurt and blended grain with a ratio of 2 : 1, and then dried at 50 oC for 16 hours. After dried, the eggurt products were then sampled for chemical, sensory and microbiological analysis. The results showed that eggurt mixed with sesame seeds had a highest score on texture (47. 50), aceptability (43. 06) and total lactic acid bacteria (5. 67 log CFU/g) than eggurt mixed with black soybeans and green beans, while eggurt mixed with black soybean had a highest score (P< 0. 01) on acidity (43. 85), fat (9. 13 %) and protein content (33. 06 %).

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> as an aesthetic category in nineteenth-century British culture. My contention {{is that a}} link exists between the idea <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> as it appears in literary works and sugar as an everyday commodity with a complex history attached. Sugar had changed from being considered as a luxury in 1750 to a mass-market staple by the 1850 s, a major cultural transition which altered the concept <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> as a taste. In the thesis I map {{the consequences of this}} shift as they are manifest in a range of texts from the period, alongside parallel changes in the aesthetic category <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> I also assess the relationship between the material history <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> and the separate but related concept <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>sweetness.</b> In focussing on the relationship between sugar and sweetness in the Victorian period this thesis examines an area of nineteenth-century life that has previously never been subject to detailed study. Although several critics have explored the connection between sugar and concepts <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> as they relate to abolitionist debates in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, my focus differs in that I assert that other material histories of sugar played as significant a role in developing discourses <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> Throughout this study, which spans the period 1780 - 1870, I draw on a range of sources across a variety of genres, including abolitionist pamphlets, medical textbooks, the novels of Charlotte Brontë and Wilkie Collins, the cultural criticism of Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater, and the poetry of Christina Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. I conclude that literary cultures in the nineteenth century increasingly use discourses of sugar to relate to the mass market and explore the commercialisation of literature, at a time when a growing commodity culture was seen as a threat to literary integrity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Levulose (D-fructose, fruit sugar), C 6 H 12 O 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} ketohexose. This sugar has distinctive properties {{which make}} it of commercial interest. It is more costly than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). Levulose {{is characterized by a}} high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> (6), great solubility (20), and medical usefulness when administered intravenously. Joslin (21) and Root and Baker (32) found levulose to be of great value in the treatment of diabetes. According to Daniel (8), it is assimilated and oxidized more quickly than sucrose, supplying the necessary energy requirements for the human system. Additional uses of levulose have been reported by McGlumphy and Eichinger (27), which include its application to improve the quality and the flavor of jams, jellies, marmalades, canned fruits, carbonated beverages, and corn sugar. Plants of the family compositae contain large amounts of levulose polymers, but the dahlia, chicory, and Jerusalem artichoke are the most promising sources because of the high levulose content and the ease of production (13). The tubers of Jerusalem artichoke were used in this study because they offer an inexpensive and prolific source from which levulose can be extracted. Since most of the levulose units in the artichoke tubers are linked together to form inulin or carbohydrate intermediate compounds between inulin and levulose, it is necessary to hydrolyze the material in order to free the levulose. Several investigators have reported the use of acid compounds. Anderson and Greaves (1) used H 2 SO 4 for hydrolysis, while Yamasaki (41) used HC 1 for the same purpose. Kleiderer and Englis (23) obtained complete hydrolysis of inulin by use of CO 2 and SO 2 at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch at 150 o C. for 60 minutes. As fare as can be determined from the literature, little work was done prior to 1953 using radioactive material to study peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since that time, a law was passed by the United States Congress authorizing the use of radioactive material for peaceful purposes, thereby making it possible to use atomic energy for this study. Since previous work has shown that gamma rays can convert starch to simple sugar (33), it was therefore, assumed that the inulin and other carbohydrate intermediates of Jerusalem artichoke upon hydrolysis by beta or gamma rays might yield fructose (35). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of beta and gamma rays on inulin and other carbohydrate intermediate compounds present in the Jerusalem artichoke tubers and to compare the results with those obtained by hydrolysis with radiation plus hydrochloric acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis was {{to understand how the}} quality and performance of dried cassava products could be developed by drying and other processing steps. This goal was achieved in several stages. First, a survey of the composition of six cassava varieties from Bolivia, was performed, which resulted in the report of chemical and mineral compositions of the tubers. The mineral compositions of the tubers were compared to the elemental composition of the soil in order to identify depleted and enriched elements. In a second step, an enzymatic assay for the determination of lower sugars in cassava was developed. This technique rendered it possible to measure the content of free glucose, maltose and sucrose in six varieties of cassava. The third step implied the development of a process for partial hydrolysis of non-gelatinized cassava starch. In this study, the kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of raw cassava starch were described as a heterogeneous system, and the investigation involved leaching of amylose during starch granule swelling, and morphological characterizations of starch granules using SEM as well as light microscopy. Results included a model describing the kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis and which assumed a blocklet structure of the starch granule and reveals that the enzymatic attack occurs mainly at the interior starch-water interface of the granule. Fourth, a model describing the kinetics of the drying of cassava starch was put forward. From this investigation, a quasi steady state model was developed based on heat and mass transfer. Finally, the impact of high pressure homogenization of dissolved starch was studied, which involved the degradation and conformational changes of starch as caused by the process. The characterization was performed with AsFlFFF with MALS and RI detection. Upon high pressure homogenization, the molar mass, mean square radius and hydrodynamic radius were found to decrease. The process also induced an increase and scaling with size in the apparent density of the macromolecules in addition to alterations in the molecular conformation. Furthermore, homogenization caused an increase in the overlap concentration. During the investigations constituting this thesis, native cassava of Bolivia was discovered to be a fairly tasteless starch-rich product with a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> In order {{to be used as a}} base for drinks, as is the case for chive, an interesting concept could be to partly hydrolyze the starch. In granular form its kinetics was described. Moreover, granular starch can be efficiently dried. The hydrolysis may restrict the viscosity-generating properties of the starch, and a critical parameter is the overlap concentration. The present study has shown that this parameter is not very dependent on the molar weight of the starch...|$|E
40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is an {{important}} legume mainly used for human consumption worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Cowpea legume is rich in protein (25 %), carbohydrates (70 %), dietary fibre, minerals and vitamins. Cowpea comprises a range of varieties that breeders release based primarily on agronomic characteristics, such as yield, early maturity and drought tolerance. However, consumers do not always adopt all the released cowpea varieties. Cooking characteristics such as cooking time and sensory properties (i. e. appearance, texture, flavour) of cooked cowpeas {{are believed to be}} quality characteristics for legume acceptability by consumers. Physicochemical characteristics are known to influence cooking characteristics of cowpeas. These characteristics may be influenced by seed coat and cotyledon structure. The present study focuses on the effect of seed coat and cotyledon structure on cooking and sensory characteristics of cowpeas and how this in turn influences consumer acceptability of cowpeas. The influence of seed coat thickness and cotyledon compactness on cooking characteristics of four cowpea types (thick seed coat/compact cotyledon (Bechuana White), thick seed coat/porous cotyledon (IT 82 E 18), thin seed coat/compact cotyledon (Black Eye) and thin seed coat/porous cotyledon (California Black) was studied. Seed coat thickness was found to influence water absorption during soaking. Cowpeas with thin seed coats had higher rates of water absorption during soaking due to its amorphous cell layer that rendered the seed coat more permeable compared to the palisade cell layer found in cowpeas with thick seed coats. Cotyledon compactness influenced cooking time of cowpeas. Cowpeas with porous cotyledons cooked faster compared to cowpeas with compact cotyledon probably because of the structural arrangement of porous cotyledon cells that provide more intercellular spaces for rapid water entry, cell expansion and separation favouring a faster cooking process compared to compact cotyledon. Seed coat and cotyledon structures directly influenced very few of the cooking and sensory characteristics. Sensory attributes such as cooked cowpea flavour, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweetness,</b> degree of sweet aftertaste, and degree of mushiness positively contributed to consumers’ liking of cowpeas. Raw cowpea flavour, bitter taste, degree of bitter aftertaste and degree of firmness contributed to consumers’ disliking of cowpeas. Chemical composition of cowpeas probably influences sensory characteristics of cowpeas more than seed coat and cotyledon structures. It is recommended that breeders work together with food scientists in order to release cowpeas types that are preferred by consumers (i. e. cowpeas with good appearance (low percentage of splitting), good flavour and soft texture upon cooking.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explore a visuality <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> It is social {{construct}} with a sentimental meaning and it is used by marketing communication. We suppose that our phenomena is not build up on connotation such as a taste of sensation how it could be asssumed. It is build by a sentimental meaning. For a verification we establish conditions which have to be proved by a representation to be labeled as the visuality <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> The selected phenomena is close to Barthes's theory of myth as a secondary semiotic system. That is the reason why we need to address this dilemma. The background of an origin <b>of</b> the <b>sweetness</b> visualitation could help us understand Hackley's critical view on prism of social constructivism. Both theories could not be complete in a measure of marketing communication and a whole concept <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> visualisation is completed in Kress's multimodality theory. The part of the paper is empirical semiotic material which helps us to demonstrate a scale of a use <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> visualisation from a binary oppossition to a complete use <b>of</b> visual <b>sweetness</b> in marketing communication...|$|R
