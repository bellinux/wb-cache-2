50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, and <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The engine {{inner wall}} surface {{temperature}} {{was measured by}} the plug blind-hole extrapolation, and multiple thermocouples were installed at different depths in the substrate. The engine wall extrapolation model of transient high temperature was established according to the basic principles of heat transfer. The transient temperatures were measured by thermocouples buried at different depths of the engine wall and fitting curve was got. The transient temperature field which was generated by the three oxy-hydrogen <b>flame</b> <b>guns</b> was used to simulate the transient high temperature field inside the engine wall. The simulated inner wall surface temperature curves of the engine could be got by the curve fitting extrapolation of temperature sensor and the infrared thermometer respectively, which show good agreement in the overall trend and at the peak point, and verify the correctness of the extrapolation model and method.

5000|$|One of {{the vital}} {{materials}} {{in the production of}} crystal coffins, the quartz crystals used to make quartz glass, had to be obtained from the East China Sea because of the rarity of quartz in mainland China (and the lack of any quality crystals of necessary size in the world). When the excavated quartz powder was processed, an issue arose from the fact that such large pieces of quartz glass would require three years of gradual cooling to remove any internal stress. Xu Zhaocai (徐兆采), a senior technician of the 605th Factory, solved this problem by developing a technique of welding twenty square centimeter pieces into a larger two square meter plate. This was carried out by a senior technician named Shi Weicheng (石维成), who used a hydrogen-oxygen <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> to reach the necessary temperatures of nearly [...] (even the metallic protective gear Shi wore proved vulnerable to the heat and he had other workers pour water onto him to keep him cool).

50|$|Instead of {{challenging}} the top staying hurdlers, Little Owl was sent novice chasing {{and he made}} his seasonal debut in the Dipper Novices' Chase at Newcastle. Despite conceding experience and race fitness to all of his opponents, he jumped immaculately and comfortably prevailed by a length {{and a half from}} Peterhof, a former Triumph Hurdle winner and twice placed in the Stayers' Hurdle in what would be that horses' last start. He was less convincing in his jumping a fortnight later in the West of Scotland Pattern Novices' Chase at Ayr where he beat Irish raider Romany Count by half a length although to his credit, he was giving away 10lb over a trip short of his optimum. Little Owl was seen to better effect next time over three miles in the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase at Ascot where he was well fancied to make it three from three over fences. Again he made several mistakes, blamed on the roving television camera by his jockey, and was still eight lengths behind when Caper's Lad sadly took a fatal fall four out. While whether Little Owl would have won that day was a matter of contention, in the end, he did win the contest by twelve lengths from the average Martinstown. With a perfect record over fences, Little Owl went into the Sun Alliance Chase as a well fancied second favourite behind Edward O'Grady's 1978 Stayers' Hurdle winner <b>Flame</b> <b>Gun.</b> However, the jumping problems which dogged him throughout the season ended his race at the tenth fence.|$|E

40|$|Atomization is {{the most}} common method for {{producing}} powders from metal. There are three atomization methods in powder fabrication : water atomization, gas atomization, and centrifugal atomization. Atomization was being developed to increase powder quality and process productivity. A new atomization method is possible to find by using another energy resources. Oxy-acetylene can be used as an energy resource in atomization. In this research, powders are made by oxy-acetylene atomization method. Material in wire form is melted in oxy-acetylene flame, which has operating temperature around 3480 oC, and atomized to form a fine spray. The fine molten droplets rapidly solidify forming a powders. This research investigate the variation of wire diameter and <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> attacking angle on atomization process efficiency and production rate. Wire material which used in this research is commercial steel wire with 0. 75 mm; 1. 25 mm; 1. 50 mm in diameter. <b>Flame</b> <b>gun</b> attacking angle is varied 25 o, 30 o, 35 o, 40 o, and 45 o.

40|$|Spongy Raney nickel {{catalysts}} {{for use as}} hydrogen electrodes of {{fuel cells}} were prepared by a new method. In this method molten a luminum was sprayed {{on both sides of}} a spongy plate of nickel as substrate with an acetylene-oxygen <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> Then, the spongy nickel electrodes were activated by alloying at a given temperature of from 550 ~ to 750 ~ and leaching the a luminum from the alloy in alkaline solution. This type of catalyst showed good thermal and electrical con-ductivity and also mechanical strength by itself. Its polarization resistance was very low, and the characteristics of the electrodes improved with increase in the temperature of heat-treatment for alloying. The finding that activity depended on the alloying temperature was consistent with observations by scanning electron microscope on the surface textures of cat-a]ysts alloyed at different emperatures. Raney nickel catalyst is said to be suitable for hydrogen electrodes of alkaline H 2 -O 2 fuel cells because of its low cost and high activity. The characteristics of polarization for electrodes of Raney nickel electrocatalyst depend mainly on the structure of the electrodes.
