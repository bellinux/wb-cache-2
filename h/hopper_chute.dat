50|$|White's Shed is timber framed. Thirteen {{transverse}} frames {{support the}} roof, {{which are in}} turn linked by a ridge beam, purlins and girts, a wall top plate, and diagonal wall braces. Large double doors {{are present in the}} ends of the building and central on the east and west walls. These doors are supported by I-beams. The roof is gabled and has a ventilated ridge. A complex system of conveyors and <b>hopper</b> <b>chutes</b> for the delivery of sugar bags is present attached to the ceiling of the structure. The building's wall and roof cladding is of recently installed corrugated sheeting. A secure room is present along the inside of the north wall.|$|R
50|$|The kiln complex {{consists}} of a boiler shed with a prominent tall stack, <b>hopper</b> and <b>chutes,</b> control room, reconditioning chamber, a four chamber drying kiln and associated equipment, fixtures and fittings including a steam engine and electric generators in the boiler shed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{potential}} methods to move woodchips: pneumatic, conveyor belt, <b>hopper</b> with direct <b>chute,</b> batch system (manual conveyance).|$|R
50|$|The boiler was fuelled by {{waste from}} the {{adjacent}} sawmill via a <b>hopper</b> and <b>chutes</b> (all extant). As well as providing steam for the kiln, the boiler powered a steam engine and electric generator (extant). Electricity from this {{was used to}} power the electrical plant including the fans.|$|R
50|$|Rokenbok {{contains}} a user-constructed chute system. This includes the ROK Motorized Conveyor, <b>hoppers,</b> sorting <b>chutes,</b> trap door chutes, {{along with many}} other curve pieces. Hoppers will sort the ROK balls in one of two directions depending on where the balls fall. Sorting chutes will force the red ROK balls to fall through a hole that the blue ROKs can't go through. Trap door chutes have a hinged door that you can open or close, then deciding if the ROKs will move on or not.|$|R
40|$|A {{great many}} {{industrial}} processes involve interaction between solids and fluids (i. e. gases or liquids). Combustion, gasification of solid fuels, shales or solid wastes, drying of particles, calcining, particle heating, regenerative heat exchangers, oxidation or reduction of ores, metal surface treatments and catalytic and thermal cracking {{are some of}} such processes. Solids and fluids serve different roles and several combinations of solids and fluids can arise in a practical situation. Thus, when considering processes or plants {{it is necessary to}} be clear as to the particular purpose served by the fluids and the solids. Heating and drying of solids, for example, involve heat and mass transfer only, whereas combustors, gasifiers etc. have the additional complication of chemical reactions which have to be carried out simultaneously with heat and mass transfer. Again, there are many processes where just the flow of granular particles take place, for example, the flow of food grain, coal or sand particles through bin, silo, <b>hoppers,</b> <b>chutes,</b> conveyor belts, inclined planes etc. In most of these cases, a theoretical modeling of the process requires a complete and thorough understanding of the phenomena involved and constitutive modeling of the constituents along with the usual balance laws. In a process, where both a fluid and a solid constituents are involved, it is essential to model both the constituents such that the models accurately describes the characteristics of the constituent concerned. While there are many different models available for fluids, the models for granular materials lack from an understanding of the material parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a granular material with boundary materials {{is one of}} the most important factors to consider when designing mass flow <b>hoppers,</b> <b>chutes,</b> feeders and other equipment where flow is expected to occur. Numerous properties of a bulk material and wall surface influence the measurement of wall friction angles (e. g. particle size and distribution, particle shape, particle and boundary asperities and moisture content) which can be difficult to thoroughly investigate on a standard Jenike direct shear tester. Often the Jenike direct shear tester is limited to small particle sizes, wall sample materials, shear rates and displacements. This paper presents the design and commissioning of a new large scale wall friction tester (LSWFT) to measure the wall friction angles of dry and wet bulk materials with a wide particle size distribution using a large shear cell. Factors which are examined on the LSWFT include particle size, moisture content, wall sample material conditions (i. e. effects of joints and edges between tiled materials) and shear cell size to improve the understanding of granular material interaction withboundaries to enhance infrastructure performance. The wall yield loci and kinematic angles of wall friction measured from the LSWFT are compared to the Jenike direct shear tester to examine the difference between the two measuring techniques and evaluate the performance of the LSWFT. The results presented in this paper are preliminary and are not intended to show any particle or shear cell scaling effects but to rather demonstrate the potential usefulness of the LSWFT and limitations of the Jenike tester...|$|R
50|$|With the {{construction}} of the coal facility, railroad hopper cars loaded with coal could be brought directly by way of carfloat, where a locomotive hauled the hopper car(s) off the carfloat and brought it up an incline and placed it in the elevated coal facility. The <b>hopper</b> car had <b>chutes</b> on its underside and these chutes where placed over the coal bins by locomotive, and when opened, the coal would discharge into the storage bins (silo) below. These storage bins themselves were elevated above street level, and at such time when the retailers wagon or truck, located under the silo chute; the coal could be dispensed directly into the coal retailers vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The {{flow and}} {{transport}} of granular media {{have been of}} major importance in commerce and industry for a long time; materials such as coal, ore, cement, grain, soap granules, sugar, sand, gravel, etc., flow in <b>hoppers,</b> bins, <b>chutes,</b> rotating drums, and moving bands. The desire to improve such transportation equipment and to reduce the energy expenditure has motivated interest in understanding the fluid mechanics of such bulk flows (Wieghardt [25] 1). Though transport, heat transfer, and other processes are often effected by fluidization we are concerned here with those situations in which the flow takes place with direct physical contact between the grains. Indeed the simplest situation is that in which the interstitial fluid (usually air) has a negligible effect on the equations of motion. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a comparison of experimental data and analysis for the flow of dry granular media through a two-dimensional or wedge-shaped hopper. It will be seen that the analytical solution which begins with the constitutive postulates suggested by Jenike and Shield [9] of (i) intergrain Coulomb friction and (ii) isotropy produces results which are in good agreement with the experimental measurements...|$|R
50|$|Ground {{was broken}} on November 13, 2009 and was {{completed}} {{in the summer of}} 2011. The renovations used the 65000 sq ft of space to create seven studios, including the 180-seat Michael and Ginger Frost Studio Theater. The building design includes areas for production, wardrobe/costume, physical therapy, storage, artist locker rooms and administration. BNIM Architects were challenged with adapting the Power House structure into a new facility. Design elements from the historic building will be incorporated to create unique interior elements, such as coal <b>hoppers</b> and ash <b>chutes</b> as children’s dressing rooms. Restoring the abandoned Power House building to the new home for the Kansas City Ballet cost approximately $39 million, which included a $7 million endowment. Of the costs, $11 million {{came in the form of}} state and federal historic tax cuts given to the Kansas City Ballet for restoring this near extinct building.|$|R
40|$|Annular, ring or {{torsional}} shear testers {{are commonly}} used in bulk solids handling research {{for the purpose of}} powder characterisation or equipment design. This paper reports from a DEFRA sponsored project which aims to develop an industrial powder flow-ability tester (based on an automated annular shear tester) that is economic to buy and quick and easy to use in trained but unskilled hands. A necessary part of the development of the annular shear tester was to design a wall friction cell so that a complete ‘flow’ characterisation of a powder could be undertaken. Whilst the Jenike type linear wall friction tester is the accepted standard tester, {{a review of the literature}} turned up several different designs for torsional type wall friction testers. However, from the literature review it was apparent that what appears to be a simple test gives very varied results and that there is a need to standardise the wall friction test procedure to get reproducible results. This paper reports the effects on the measured wall failure loci, and effective wall friction angle of changes in the testing procedure such as: • the technique used to prepare the wall sample prior to testing, to produce a dirty surface representative of the material in service in a <b>hopper</b> or <b>chute,</b> • consolidating the powder over an increasing versus a decreasing stress range, • assumption of a family of over-consolidated failure loci versus a single critically consolidated locus, • and shearing the powder over the wall versus shearing the wall over the powde...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review some recent {{advances}} in DEM (DPM) modelling undertaken at the University of Twente. We introduce the new open-source package MercuryDPM {{that we have been}} developing over the last few years. MercuryDPM is an object-oriented program with a simple C++ implementation and in-cludes: support for moving and complex walls, such as polyhedra or screw-threads; state-of-the-art granular contact models; multi-species support; specialised classes, allowing the easy implementation of common geometries like <b>chutes,</b> <b>hoppers,</b> etc.; common handler in-terfaces for particles, walls and boundaries (so all type of objects are changed using the same interfaces); restarting; large self-test suite and numerous simple demos; visualisation support, both internal and using Visual Molecular Dynamics. Additionally to these features, MercuryDPM has two major components that, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, cannot be found in other DPM packages. Firstly, it uses a novel advanced contact detection method that is able of dealing with multiple distinct granular components with sizes ranging over many orders of magnitude: the hierarchical grid.

40|$|In many {{mining and}} {{industrial}} processes where {{large quantities of}} non-degrading bulk materials such as crushed ores are handled, silos, <b>hoppers,</b> stockpiles and <b>chutes</b> are widely used because they are economical and reliable (if properly designed and operated). However, they are not free of trouble and may experience flow problems such as arching, ratholing, erratic flow, limited storage capacity, limited discharge flow rate, caking, segregation and/or flooding. Moisture content and fine particles significantly affect the flowability of most ores, increasing their cohesive strength and turning them more prone to these problems. The {{purpose of this article}} is to highlight a proven, scientific method that can be utilized to ensure reliable storage, flow and discharge of bulk solids in these equipment based on Jenike’s flow-of-solids theory and laboratory testing. Knowledge of the flow properties of the material handled provides a design basis to ensure mass flow, avoid arching and prevent the formation of “ratholes”. The effect of an increase in water content of the ore is discussed with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{requests}} assistance in preventing deaths and injuries among workers who load, operate, or work near refuse compacting or baling equipment. Recent NIOSH investigations suggest that worker injuries and deaths could be prevented by using safe work procedures, appropriate safety devices, and hazardous energy control {{programs designed to}} address the hazards of operating, maintaining, and servicing compacting and baling equipment. This Alert describes five cases of fatal injuries that resulted when workers entered, fell, or were caught and pulled into energized compacting or baling equipment. All managers, supervisors, and workers in companies that use compacting or baling equipment should follow the recommendations in this Alert. NIOSH requests that equipment manufacturers, safety and health officials, industry associations, unions, and editors of trade journals bring the recommendations in this Alert {{to the attention of}} all employers and workers who use compacting and baling equipment. Compacting and baling equipment reduces large amounts of solid waste to smaller, more manageable units by means of powered rams. These machines may be used by manufacturing companies to compact and bale large amounts of scrap and waste materials such as paper, cotton, and metals, and by retail and service industries to compress paper and cardboard boxes. Compactors compress the refuse material into containers for transport. Baling equipment is designed to compress material and produce a bale (bound or unbound) that can be handled and transported as a material unit. Compacting and baling equipment are available in many sizes and configurations. These machines may have one or more rams for compressing materials or extruding bales. The rams may move vertically or horizontally. Some types of equipment allow direct access to the compression chamber. Others have a <b>hopper</b> or <b>chute</b> through which material feeds into the machine. In businesses where refuse processing is incidental to the primary operation (such as in retail and service industries), loading and compressing may be done as separate work activities-that is, material may be intermittently loaded until the chamber is full and then compressed. Alternatively, in businesses where compressing scrap and waste materials is the primary operation or where large volumes of refuse materials are processed daily, loading and compressing is a continuous operation. Machines may operate in a manual, semiautomatic, or automatic mode. In the manual mode, a switch operated by a worker controls ram motion. In the semiautomatic mode, an operator initiates the compression, after which the machine automatically completes the cycle. In the automatic mode, a sensor inside the compression chamber signals when the chamber is full and activates the compression cycle. Because of the widespread use of compactors and balers across varied industries, it is difficult to obtain exact numbers of workers who are exposed to the hazards of this equipment. The workers most likely to be exposed to risk from compacting and baling equipment are those in the wholesale trade and transportation/public utilities industries engaged in recycling and the collection and disposal of refuse. Employees working in manufacturing settings and in retail and service trades may also be at risk because of the large volume of waste generated and processed daily.

Firstly, it uses a novel advanced contact detection method that is able of dealing with multiple distinct granular components with sizes ranging over many orders of magnitude: the hierarchical grid. We explain how this algorithm works and demonstrate the speedup gained over the traditional linked cell approach. This algorithm has lower complexity for poly-dispersed ows which means for the first time large simulations with extremely wide size distributions are feasible. Secondly, we present a novel way to extract continuum fields from discrete particle systems that is applicable to mixtures as well as boundaries and interfaces. The particle data is coarse grained in a way that is by construction compatible with the continuum equations of mass-, momentum-, and energy balance. Boundary interaction forces are taken into account in a self-consistent way and thus allow the construction of a continuous stress field even within one particle radius of the boundaries. The method does not require temporal averaging and thus can be used to investigate time-dependent flows as well as static and steady situations. This coarse-graining method is available from MercuryDPM either as a post-processing tool or it can be run in real time. In real-time mode, it not only reduces the data which has to be stored but also allows boundary conditions etc. to be updated depending on the current macroscopic state of the system, e. g. allowing the creation of a pressure-release wall. Finally, we illustrate these tools and a selection of other features of MercuryDPM via various problems including size-driven segregation in chute flow, rotating drums, and screw-conveyer...|$|R
