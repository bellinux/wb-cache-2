We show that the <b>irregularity</b> of LDPC <b>codes</b> can be optimized to provide more protection to the most sensitive bits within a codeword. Applying this in a quality progressive image transmission context, the designed code improves performance compared to existing codes. I...|$|R

The proposed architecture utilizes the value-reuse property of offset min-sum, block-serial scheduling of computations and turbo decoding message passing algorithm. Techniques of data-forwarding and out-of-order processing {{are used to}} deal with the <b>irregularity</b> of the <b>codes.</b> The decoder has the following advantages when compared to recent state-of-the-art architectures: 55 % savings in memory, reduction of routers by 50 % and increase of throughput by 2 x...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{optimized}} channel coding for OFDM transmissions (COFDM) over frequency-selective channels using irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Firstly, we {{introduce a new}} characterization of the LDPC <b>code</b> <b>irregularity</b> called “irregularity profile.” Then, using this parameterization, we derive a new criterion based on the minimization of the transmission bit error probability to design an irregular LDPC code suited to the frequency selectivity of the channel. The optimization of this criterion is done using the Gaussian approximation technique. Simulations illustrate the good performance of our approach for different transmission channels.|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{associated}} with the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) viral particle were identified by a combined approach of proteomic and genomic methods. Purified MCMV virions were dissociated by complete denaturation and subjected to either separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in-gel digestion or treated directly by in-solution tryptic digestion. Peptides were separated by nanoflow liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The MS/MS spectra obtained were searched against a database of MCMV open reading frames (ORFs) predicted to be protein coding by an MCMV-specific version of the gene prediction algorithm GeneMarkS. We identified 38 proteins from the capsid, tegument, glycoprotein, replication, and immunomodulatory protein families, as well as 20 genes of unknown function. Observed <b>irregularities</b> in <b>coding</b> potential suggested possible sequence errors in the 3 ′-proximal ends of m 20 and M 31. These errors were experimentally confirmed by sequencing analysis. The MS data further indicated the presence of peptides derived from the unannotated ORFs ORFc 225441 - 226898 (m 166. 5) and ORF 105932 - 106072. Immunoblot experiments confirmed expression of m 166. 5 during viral infection...|$|R
40|$|A novel self-trimming {{algorithm}} for A/D converters [1, 2] {{has been}} presented which continually trims thresholds in the flash A/D subconverters of two-stage and pipe-lined A/D converters. Roughly speaking, it trims thresholds up or down by small increments {{in such a way}} as to smooth out <b>irregularities</b> in the <b>code</b> density. This paper presents the mathematical analysis and design of the algorithm. The algo-rithm was analyzed by a novel two-dimensional z-transform introduced in [3], which can be used to demonstrate its stability, predict convergence rate, and which can be used to give a frequency-domain interpretation of the distinct prop-erties of differential and integral nonlinearity.

40|$|Abstract. Numerous modern seismic codes {{including}} Eurocode 8 provide {{rules to}} avoid pos-sible adverse {{impact of the}} presence of masonry infills in concrete buildings or unbraced steel or composite structures. These adverse effects include damage of columns in contact with strong infills, reduction of the clear column height because of partial contact with masonry along height, planwise and heightwise <b>irregularity.</b> However, <b>codes</b> emphasize on the design of new structures, while little information is provided on modeling of masonry infills. Con-versely, when the seismic upgrading of existing structures is performed with those methods that have received wider application in engineering practice, i. e., strengthening of columns and beams with reinforced concrete (RC) jackets or Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs), con-struction of additional RC shear walls and construction of diagonal steel elements, any bene-ficial effect of masonry infills is usually ignored. The present research examines the effectiveness of strengthening existing RC frames with the application of FRP sheets on their brick-infill walls. This recently proposed method uses the advantageous mechanical proper-ties of FRPs and is characterized by relatively low cost and ease of implementation compared to other aforementioned available retrofit schemes. A multi-strut masonry panel element i...|$|R
40|$|We show shortcutting and {{overlapping}} techniques that, {{separately and}} in combination show promise of speedup for parallel processing {{of problems with}} irregular or asymmetric computation. Methodology is developed and demonstrated on an example problem.... 1 Introduction We are interested in parallel programs for irregular and asymmetric problems. We have the same program on all processors, but data dependent logic may evaluate differently at different nodes, causing different code to execute, or resulting in different amounts of work by the same code. Such problems present challenges for parallel processing because synchronization delays can be {{of the order of}} the computation time. There are different kinds of <b>irregularity</b> in parallel <b>codes.</b> Data structure <b>irregularity</b> is one common case that has been addressed previously [1]. In other applications, data among parallel tasks can be regular, but access unpredictable [2] or asymmetric [3]. Another large class of problems are ver [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Classical linear block codes, such as Reed-Solomon (RS) -based codes, fail {{to recover}} any lost message symbols when the total losses exceed the {{redundant}} symbols. Under such adverse channel conditions, source and/or channel rate adaptation to incorporate additional redundancy {{might not be}} a viable option. In this paper, we explore a novel method of code adaptation which alters the degree distribution in order to achieve partial recovery of information when complete recovery is not possible. In particular, we change the degree distribution by adjusting the density and <b>irregularity</b> of the <b>code.</b> First, we illustrate that, while maintaining a constant rate, a partial recovery code can be optimized by density modification. Then, we focus on the Partial Reed-Solomon (PRS) codes, which are a family of RS-based codes that are capable of achieving different levels of partial recovery by adjustment to their order. We analyze the dependence of erasure recovery of these codes on density and regularity for a given number of losses. Finally, we present results and analysis which demonstrate that, for a given number of erasures, the PRS codes of order- 1 render optimal (erasure-recovery) performance.

40|$|Background and Purpose—A stroke “weekend effect ” on {{mortality}} {{has been}} demonstrated in other countries with a possible slight effect in the United States. We studied patients with stroke in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for a weekend effect on thrombolytic use, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, hospital charges, and length of stay. Methods—The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2002 to 2007 was searched for all emergency room admissions for International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision codes corresponding to ischemic stroke. Generalized estimated equations for generalized linear models were performed, adjusting for gender, age, race, season, median income level, payer, comorbidity score, hospital region, hospital location, teaching status, bed size, and hospital annual stroke case volume to compare weekend versus weekday stroke admission incidence of thrombolytic use, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, hospital charges, and length of stay. The same analysis was performed using the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision codes for ischemic stroke AND transient cerebral ischemia to check internal validity for <b>coding</b> <b>irregularities</b> that may occur in differentiating stroke from transient ischemic attack. Results—There were 599 087 emergency room admissions for ischemic stroke: 159 906 weekend admissions and 439 181 weekday admissions. Generalized estimated equation for generalized linear model analysis was performed and demonstrated weekend compared with weekday patients with stroke were slightly more likely to receive thrombolytics (OR 1. 114; 95 % CI 1. 039 to 1. 194; P 0. 003); incur slightly higher total hospital charges (effect ratio 1. 011; 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{research}} {{as a whole is}} dedicated to studies of the work load of navigation officers and, consequently, is related to the current international research on the quality of working life. Issues of seafarers' working time are very topical because in recent years the load of navigation officers has significantly increased, either due to increase in shipping intensity, or {{in the context of the}} new international maritime law, for example, compliance with the requirements of the ISM CODE (International Management safety Code), THE ISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security <b>Code).</b> <b>Irregularities</b> are observed in practice of the seafarers' working hours and rest hours, and even the mismatch, as presented in the port of inspection materials. This article is intended to assess the 2 nd and 3 rd Officer's load compliance with the regulatory enactments for the work and rest regime to develop proposals to load optimization. Load analysis of Navigation officers is based on international maritime regulations that determine the work and rest regime on ships STCW (The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), MLC (Maritime Labour Convention). In the article, concrete data is used from the research, which was conducted 18 months on the Handy type of tanker from July, 2012 till December, 2013 in the real time mode. In the article is also concrete data used from 340 survey respondents, which reflects the views of the navigation officers on violations of the work and rest regime on the ship and the fatigue issue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The common {{practice}} for achieving {{unequal error protection}} (UEP) in scalable multimedia communication systems is to design rate-compatible punctured channel codes before computing the UEP rate assignments. This paper proposes {{a new approach to}} designing powerful irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes that are optimized for the multimedia source and to ex-ploiting the inherent <b>irregularity</b> in IRA <b>codes</b> for UEP. Using the end-to-end distortion due to the first error bit in channel decoding as the cost function, which is readily given by the operational distortion-rate function of embedded source codes, we incorporate this cost function into the channel code design process via density evolution and obtain IRA codes that minimize the average cost function instead of the usual probability of error. Because the resulting IRA codes have inherent UEP capabilities due to irregu-larity, the new IRA code design effectively integrates channel code optimization and UEP rate assignments, resulting in source-opti-mized channel coding or joint source-channel coding. We simulate our source-optimized IRA codes for transporting SPIHT-coded images over a binary symmetric channel with crossover proba-bility. When = 0 03 and the channel code length is long (e. g., with one codeword for the whole 512 512 image), we are able to operate at only 9. 38 % away from the channel capacity with code length 132380 bits, achieving the best published results in terms of average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Compared to conventional IRA code design (that minimizes the probability of error) with the same code rate, the performance gain in average PSNR from using our proposed source-optimized IRA code design is 0. 8759 dB when = 0 1 and the code length is 12800 bits. As predicted by Shannon’s separation principle, we observe that this performance gain diminishes as the code length increases.
