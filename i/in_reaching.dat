40|$|Abstract In a {{longitudinal}} study of two streams whose lower reaches received unattenuated urban stormwater runoff, physical disturbance by stormflow was {{less important than the}} persistant unidentified chemical impacts of urban storm-water in limiting the distribution of Chironomi-dae, and Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera (EPT). A hierarchical spatial analysis showed that chironomid density did not decrease from rural to urban stream reaches. Instead, the taxonomic composition of chironomid assem-blages was significantly altered in urban versus rural reaches; chironomid assemblages <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches</b> exhibited higher average pollution toler-ance scores. In contrast, the density of EPT was significantly lower <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches.</b> Despite higher values of stormflow tractive force <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches,</b> streambed stability tended to be greater <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches.</b> Modeling of temporal variation in chironomid density showed similar patterns in both rural and urban reaches: chironomid density had a unimodal relationship to rainfall index (RI), with highest densities at intermediate values of RI. Models of EPT density over time <b>in</b> rural <b>reaches</b> showed no significant relation to RI, and temporal variation in EPT density <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches</b> was not predictable. The abundance of fine particulate organic matter, including periph-yton (FPOM), on cobbles was greater <b>in</b> urban <b>reaches</b> and showed a much greater degree of temporal variation than <b>in</b> rural <b>reaches.</b> <b>In</b> urban <b>reaches,</b> a negative relation between FPOM and RI indicated the importance of stormflow abra-sion...|$|R

5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to <b>in</b> <b>Reaching</b> for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems <b>in</b> <b>reaching</b> the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11–12 September, causing a few casualties, including two killed.|$|E

A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts.

Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player <b>in</b> <b>reaching</b> new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far greater degree than security guards. Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E
