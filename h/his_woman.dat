25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

He {{explains}} Marisa was <b>his</b> <b>woman,</b> but she left him for Thomas McCall, and that the medallion she took from him {{is the key to}} the location of the Gold of Juarez. He sent his men to Hope to get it from her, but when they found she didn't have it, they killed her and Thomas. Billy explains he lost the medallion in the river, but Mendoza doesn't believe him, and sends him into the desert, giving him one hour to find the gold, or he will kill Molly. Using his memory of the shape of the medallion and his mother's story, Billy is able to locate the Gold in a hidden underground passage. However, Mendoza has followed him, and attempts to kill him. Billy flees, and is rescued by Ray, who tells him to get to safety as he returns to Mendoza's alcazar to rescue Molly. Ray then reveals his own backstory; he and Thomas were running cattle over the Mexican border when they met Marisa. They both fell in love with her, although she was Mendoza's woman, and she chose Thomas over Ray. They fled to the caverns in which the Gold was hidden, but Ray tracked them. There, he confronted Thomas. Their younger brother, William, a priest, attempted to intervene, but Ray killed him. On that day, Ray renounced violence and embraced God. Believing the gold to be cursed, he, Marisa and Thomas agreed to leave it behind and seal the cavern.|$|E

[...] "Confessions (Interlude)" [...] {{serves as the}} opening of the video. Set in a studio, Usher receives a phone message and finds out that he impregnated his mistress. After he speaks the spoken section of the interlude and gets in a car, [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] proceeds. Usher is set in a dark lit room, with only one chair. He occasionally shows a large ring on his ring finger. In the middle of the video, he lies on a piano and in his imagination, <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> and mistress are beside him. The next scene shows Usher in a brown car singing, goes out and kneels before <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> to confess. She refuses to listen and slaps Usher, then leaves and he becomes shirtless.

500|$|Usher started {{recording}} the song on July 2003 in New York City. One day, before {{the night was}} over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant.

500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by <b>his</b> <b>woman,</b> [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Believe in Me" [...] is {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of a lover about to leave <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> for a prison term and asks for patience and support. Miles Marshall Lewis views that the song [...] "embod elements of the (oft-downtrodden) blue-collar African-American experience." [...] "Lady Sunday" [...] is a dance-oriented, orchestrated song with musical similarities to early 1970s Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. [...] "Believe That It's So" [...] features disco strings, assertive brass, and a narrative that celebrates love's ability to help people overcome adversity before celebrating celebration in general, as Kelly sings about becoming drunk and needing to draw on love to overcome his impending hangover. Deviating from the album's 1970s influence, [...] "All Rounds on Me" [...] has rockabilly elements and an alternating blues arrangement.|$|E
500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E

500|$|Pitchfork Media {{wrote that}} [...] "in a skit called [...] "Bitches Talkin", the ladies {{tell him to}} cut {{it out with the}} damn Radiohead, while [...] "Optimistic" [...] is playing in the background; in 'Songs For Women', he obliges—he's an indie kid when it comes to {{alienation}} but a pragmatist when it comes to sex." [...] "Songs For Women" [...] is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> doesn't listen to him or his music: [...] "It's like she never heard of me." [...] In spite of the [...] "suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung [...] "by real R big-shots (Drake included)".|$|E

[...] "La Vida Está De Luto" [...] {{is inspired}} by the actual situation of the planet, a place where man is accustomed to taking advantage of those weaker. [...] "Ni Tu Ni Yo" [...] is the only duet on the album, as it features Mexican ranchera singer Paquita la del Barrio.

500|$|The song [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] is a pop piano ballad {{and shows}} {{traditional}} notions of romance, a pre-fame heartbreak as Mars regrets letting <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> get away. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought the track [...] "sounds {{like a cross}} between Stevie Wonder and Elton John," [...] also seeing [...] "a touch of Michael Jackson" [...] in his delivery. Andy Gill of The Independent called it a [...] "McCartney-esque piano ballad", while Jason Lipshut of Billboard wrote that [...] "it will make for a killer lighters-in-the-air moment in concert. Although it's not quite an Alicia Keys-esque powerhouse, [...] smartly allows Mars to momentarily remove his fedora and bare his soul". The single was additionally likened to the material of Wham!. With [...] "Natalie", Mars exhibits further male chauvinist sentiments over a girl named Natalie which stole Mars' money and ran away with it; the singer is therefore plotting murderous revenge against her. The song was described as [...] "a sort of methed-up [...] "Dirty Diana", assembled with fierce handclaps and hard-edged oooh-oooh vocal echos". Lipshutz called it the [...] "flip-side of [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] and pointed out Mars lamenting the hypnotism of a [...] "gold-digging bitch". [...] "Show Me" [...] portrays a recording with ample influences of reggae and dancehall. These infusions are easily noticed by the [...] "over sampled air horns", [...] "tape-echo effects" [...] and steel drums.|$|E
500|$|Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, stating, [...] "he utilizes his vocal range here, including the teasing falsetto {{with which he}} gently instructs his partner to 'take this pillow right here/If you bite it, they won't hear.'

[...] She {{also pointed out that}} the song was inspired by Songz's [...] "stylistic antecedent", R. Kelly. Mark Edward Nero of About.com also said the song was R. Kelly influenced, calling the song among the album's best material. Nero said, [...] "Trey brags about how the people next door probably know who he is because <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> screams it during sex. 'While I be bangin' on your body, they be bangin' on our wall,' he sings. 'While they be dreamin', you be screamin', now they bangin' on our door.'"

In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The [...] actor approached the [...] director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, [...] "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to the language we use here." [...] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced [...] "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the New York Evening Post. In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard, and <b>His</b> <b>Woman</b> with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost [...] during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.|$|E
500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows <b>his</b> <b>woman</b> real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo!
