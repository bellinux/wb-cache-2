40|$|Many complex organizations, such {{as planned}} Soviet {{enterprises}} and the U. S. military, routinely <b>transfer</b> employees between <b>jobs.</b> Since this sacrifices job-specific human capital, {{the practice is}} puzzling. This article shows that regular <b>job</b> <b>transfers</b> {{may be part of}} an optimal incentive scheme in organizations plagued by the ratchet effect. The ratchet effect arises when an employer is uncertain as to the productivity of the various positions or jobs within an organization. Workers in highly productive jobs then have an incentive to disguise the productivity of their jobs by expending low effort and producing low output. This avoids having the employer construct more demanding remuneration schemes once the high productivity of a job becomes known. <b>Job</b> <b>transfers</b> break the link between current performance and future incentive schemes, and hence remove the incentive-stifling implications of the ratchet effect. This article examines the tradeoff between providing more effective incentives via <b>job</b> <b>transfers</b> and the accompanying sacrifice of job-specific human capital, establishes conditions under which <b>job</b> <b>transfers</b> are optimal, and develops comparative static results. ...|$|R

Except for avoidance coping, there were no significant differences among the three groups at T 1. At T 3, the promoted group reported significantly higher future career success expectancy, job security, coping effectiveness, and procedural justice than the lat-erally transferred group. Because similar differences occurred before any <b>job</b> <b>transfers,</b> the dif-ferences at T 3 cannot be attributed to the <b>job</b> <b>transfer</b> itself, but rather to differences that emerged between T 1 and T 2 in how thosewhowere subsequently promoted appraised and copedwith the downsizing and their coping resources...|$|R

The general technique is applied to the specific case of a distributed computing system consisting of M/M/ 1 queues. For this case, an expression for the mean of the Load-Sharing Window is derived.

30|$|Similarly, Caliendo et al. (2015) {{develop a}} job search {{model in which}} locus of control drives individuals’ {{subjective}} beliefs {{about the effect of}} their search effort on the job offer arrival rate. They then compare the theoretical predictions from this model to those derived from a competing model in which an internal locus of control increases the offer arrival rate irrespective of individuals’ search intensity. While the former model predicts that <b>internal</b> <b>job</b> seekers will search more intensively, the latter model predicts they will engage in less job search. The authors then provide empirical evidence that <b>internal</b> <b>job</b> seekers both have higher reservation wages and search more intensively. Moreover, the marginal effect of an additional job application on individuals’ propensity to report that they are very likely to get a job in the next period is higher among those job seekers with an internal locus of control. These results are consistent with locus of control influencing job search through individuals’ subjective beliefs about the payoffs to search.|$|R
40|$|The relationshipbetween jobmobility andearnings {{growth is}} a {{theoretically}} important but empiri-cally neglected issue. How important are job shifts {{as a mechanism}} {{in the development of}} earnings over the life cycle? We estimate the impact of internal and external mobility on earnings growth from age 26 to 35, a crucial formative period inwork-life careers. We present a new speci¢cation for measuring long-term e¡ects of job shift sequences, and report the following main ¢ndings on the basis of data on male wage-earners in Sweden. First, <b>internal</b> and external <b>job</b> shifts are distinct pathways in work-life careers; very few individuals pursue both routes. Secondly, both kinds of mobility increase earnings growth. Internal mobility has the strongest impact. While the economic returns of <b>internal</b> <b>job</b> shifts increase with their frequency, the returns of changing employer diminish rapidly. Thirdly, the impact of ¢rm tenure and external mobility should be considered simultaneously, otherwise the e¡ects of both are biased downward. However, the tenure e¡ect on earnings is largely unrelated to <b>internal</b> <b>job</b> shifts. Fourthly, the impact of internal mobility on earn-ings growth chie£yoperates net of occupational advancement, while the e¡ects of externalmobility to a considerable extent run via occupational attainment...|$|R
