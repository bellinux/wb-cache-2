5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.

He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E

5|$|Commonly, prey-stealing occurs where larger females take {{food items}} stored in other spiders' webs. When they {{encounter}} other spiders {{of the same}} species, often <b>including</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposite sex, they engage in battle, and the defeated spider is eaten. If a male redback is accepted by a female, it is permitted to feed on the victims snared in the female's web. Baby spiders also steal food from their mother, which she tries to prevent. They also consume sticky silk as well as small midges and flies. Spiderlings are cannibalistic, more active ones sometimes eating their less active siblings.|$|E

In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
