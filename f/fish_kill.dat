5|$|In 2009 {{there was}} another major <b>fish</b> <b>kill,</b> with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam. Measures have been since {{been put in place}} to prevent a similar incident in the future.|$|E

Of the 19 documented fish kills since that year, 11 of them have occurred within DeKalb city limits. Another well documented <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> along the Kishwaukee was in 1984. According to IDOC reports the 1984 <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> and a number of others were in direct correlation with heavy canning activities at the Del Monte canning facility that once operated on Taylor Street in DeKalb. The 1984 <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> affected a portion of the river from a bend north of Lucinda Avenue, near Annie's Woods to Lincoln Highway.

25|$|Because of its {{connection}} with Flushing Bay, several fish species native to marine habitats regularly swim into and inhabit Meadow and Willow Lakes. Fish species native to Meadow Lake include American eel, Largemouth bass, Northern snakehead (an invasive species), and White mullet. Willow Lake {{is named for}} the many species of Willow plants which inhabit the area. Invasive Phragmites are also abundant. Attempts to kill the phragmites with pesticides have led to further <b>fish</b> <b>kill.</b> Numerous berry-producing trees and shrubs near Willow Lake attract several migratory bird species.

According to the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, which investigates <b>fish</b> <b>kills</b> in the Chesapeake Bay, the causes of <b>fish</b> <b>kills</b> are varied, but often are related to environmental factors such as low amounts of oxygen in the water, algal blooms, and water temperatures that are either too hot or too cold. Other factors, such as the dumping hazardous materials or excess bycatch, can also contribute.|$|R
500|$|A major <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> {{occurred}} in Big Wapwallopen Creek in 1967. A tank of a caustic substance was accidentally overturned {{and its contents}} spilled into the creek, polluting it for a stretch running from approximately [...] from the tributary Bow Creek to Legion Road/Legislative Route 40112. Approximately 4000 fish were killed, most of them minnows, suckers, and trout.|$|E
500|$|After the Trinity and Lewiston Dams were complete, the Bureau of Reclamation did not {{adhere to}} the water export limits set in the project's authorization, {{diverting}} 72percent of the total river flow {{and as much as}} 90percent at certain times. [...] On the main stem, dam construction has greatly reduced the capacity of the river to wash away excess sediment. The annual chinook salmon run has dropped by almost 80percent since the 1950s. In 2002, 65,000 adult salmon perished in a <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> on the lower Trinity and Klamath rivers (the fish were mostly of Trinity stock).|$|E
500|$|According to {{biologists}} {{from the}} State of California and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the atypical low {{flow in the}} river along with high fish return numbers and high water temperatures allowed for a gill rot disease to kill at least 33,000salmon in September 2002, before they could reproduce. [...] The die-off was downstream of the Trinity inflow, and the salmon of the Trinity were impacted {{to a greater degree}} than the Klamath as the Trinity run was at its peak. The report does mention that the official fish die-off estimate of 34,056 is probably quite low and could be only half of the actual loss. Klamath River flows as measured at the river gauge in Keno show a low flow of [...] in September 1908 (before irrigation began). During the 2002 <b>fish</b> <b>kill,</b> flows of [...] were recorded.

500|$|Irrigation {{along the}} upper Klamath and the Shasta and Scott rivers, {{along with the}} almost-total {{diversion}} of the upper Trinity River, have all lowered the total river flow supporting out-migrating young salmon in spring and in-migrating adult salmon in the fall. In the 1960s, a project was proposed to divert the entire Klamath River to Central California and Southern California, an undertaking known as the Klamath Diversion, but this project was defeated. It would have limited salmon to the last [...] of the entire river. In 2002, a major <b>fish</b> <b>kill</b> took its toll on {{the river and the}} Tribes that depend on it. More than 34,000 salmonoids died alone, due to the low waters and poor hindsight, as well as compassion, of those in charge(PacifiCorp). In 2005, PacifiCorp applied to the federal government to relicense its four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath for up to 50years. Environmentalists opposed the relicensing, arguing that the dams should be removed to reopen the upper Klamath to salmon.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>fish</b> <b>kill,</b> known also as fish die-off, {{refers to}} a {{localized}} die-off of fish populations which may also be associated with more generalized mortality of aquatic life.
