50|$|In {{the metric}} system, {{chemical}} engineers once used the kilogram-mole (notation kg-mol), which {{is defined as}} the number of entities in 12 kg of 12C, and often referred to the mole as the <b>gram-mole</b> (notation g-mol), when dealing with laboratory data.|$|E
5000|$|The unit of {{substance}} in the FPS {{system is the}} pound-mole (lb-mol) = [...] Until the SI decided to adopt the <b>gram-mole,</b> the mole was directly derived from the mass unit as (mass unit)/(atomic mass unit). The unit (lbf⋅s2/ft)-mol also appears in a former definition of the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} {{of sulfur dioxide}} to elemental sulfur was investigated using coal char and methane as reducing agents. Since high temperatures were required when using coal char, methane {{was found to be}} more favorable as the reducing agent. The {{reduction of}} sulfur dioxide with methane (natural gas) was carried out in a fixed-bed catalytic reactor containing 400 grams of alumina catalyst. The possibility of increasing yields by following the sulfur dioxide-methane reaction with a reaction between the hydrogen sulfide formed and unreacted sulfur dioxide was investigated. The low yields of sulfur that were obtained indicated that sulfur formed in the first reaction was converted to other products and that the second reaction was probably inhibited by certain components of the gas mixture. It was determined that operating without a preheat increased yields slightly and that the reaction products should be cooled as soon as possible after they have left the catalyst bed. A temperature gradient was detected throughout the catalyst bed and the influence of this gradient was found to be quite critical. Best results were obtained when the upper portion of the reaction zone was operated as low as possible without dropping the lower portion of the zone below 560 °C, the optimum temperature for producing sulfur. It was concluded that with close temperature control, conversions up to 80 percent might be expected with fresh catalyst. A mole ratio of 3. 6 moles of methane per mole of sulfur dioxide and a feed rate of 8 <b>gram-moles</b> of gas mixture per hour per 400 grams of catalyst appeared to be optimum conditions. The catalyst activity was shown to decrease approximately linearly with respect to the hours the catalyst had been in use...|$|R
