For this study, 219 fishing days were carried out in Bahia de Navidad, Jalisco, Mexico. Four gillnets with different mesh sizes (76. 2, 88. 9, 101. 6 and 114. 3 mm) were used for the fishing operations, from April 1994 to March 1995 and from January 1998 to December 2000. A total of 26126 organisms weighting 11680 kg were caught. One hundred and eighty three species belonging to 57 families and 19 orders were identified. Ten species accumulated more than 60 % of the total abundance and biomass, the remaining species (173) individually contributed with less than 2 % of the total abundance and biomass. The most important species in the catch were Microlepidotus brevipinnis, Caranx caballus, Haemulon flaviguttatum, Scomberomorus sierra, C. caninus, C. sexfasciatus, Lutjanus guttatus and L. argentiventris. The catch per unit of effort showed a large var 5287 mónica, biologíaiation during the study, both in number and biomass. On average, 110 fishes and 48. 5 <b>kg</b> <b>fishing</b> day- 1 were caught.

50|$|In 1977, Hughes-Games {{described}} the first practical marine fish/shellfish/phytoplankton culture, followed by Gordin, et al., in 1981. By 1989, a semi-intensive (1 kg fish/m−3) seabream and grey mullet pond system by the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) on the Red Sea supported dense diatom populations, excellent for feeding oysters. Hundreds of kilos {{of fish and}} oysters cultured here were sold. Researchers also quantified the water quality parameters and nutrient budgets in (5 <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> m−3) green water seabream ponds. The phytoplankton generally maintained reasonable water quality and converted on average over half the waste nitrogen into algal biomass.

50|$|Lutjanus johnii, {{commonly}} known as John's snapper or golden snapper, is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from East Africa to Fiji and Australia. In Queensland, Northern Territory {{and other parts of}} Australia it is perhaps known more commonly as Fingermark bream, and is arguably one of the best estuary eating fish. The former name ('Golden snapper') is generally used when the fish is in much larger sizes, with juveniles and young adults usually referred to as the latter ('Fingermark'). It has a remarkably slow growth rate, so release is encouraged and bag limits apply. It can grow to approximately 8 kg in weight although 10 <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> have been recorded off the coast of Cairns, though even a small individual will provide a substantial fight. They are not recommended to be targeted for catch and release when fishing in depths of 10 m or over, as the species is highly susceptible to barotrauma. Fingermark encounters often occur when targeting other species such as barramundi, and can be distinguished by their golden-brown to reddish skin tint and dark 'fingermark' beneath the dorsal fin - colourations both lost as the species dies once taken from the water or grows in size. Colourations are extremely prominent in juvenile fish. They are members of the Lutjanus genus of snappers, which also includes mangrove jack and other well-known table species.|$|E
50|$|Fishing in {{particular}} is extremely important to the local economy. Fishing provides {{the primary source of}} meat for these villagers, with fish comprising 56.3 percent of protein in the local diet. The average household consumes 83.2 <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> protein each year compared to the Laos national average of 8-10 kg /year. Among these households, 50% supplement family income by selling fish to traders in their villages. In total villagers harvest more than 55 indigenous species from in the Nam Ngum reservoir annually. In recent years the excess harvesting of the Nam Ngum reservoir has greatly reduced the biodiversity of the reservoir, and made fishing more difficult. Many ecologists have criticized the state of Laos for failing to effectively manage reservoir fishing. Annual fish production in the reservoir from 1979 to 1983 was estimated at 1,472 tons or 37 kg /ha. Since then, harvest rates and productivity have decreased substantially to about 20 kg/ha by 1988, resulting in a total estimated fish production of some 740 tonnes per year. Considering that reliable fish catch assessments are extremely difficult the actual situation may be even worse. Nonetheless, the catch statistics available indicate that the reservoir fishery has progressively shifted from the large-bodied top-predators to small-bodied, low-value planktivores. This trend of fishing down food webs is common in fisheries. The data available evidences the trend of individual fishers experience more total catches, but lesser returns from the small fish harvested. Many researchers examining the problem have suggested giving local villages more control over the regulation of fishing in the reservoir, to facilitate more sustainable fishing practices.|$|E

However, {{studies have shown that}} crafting messages to resonate with people's personal experiences can enhance engagement. Recreational fishing is one of the principal ways in which people interact with aquatic environments, but long-term data from this perspective are considered rare. We uncovered 852 popular media records of recreational fishing for an Australian estuary across a 140 -year period. Using information contained in these articles we analysed the species composition of recreational catches over time and constructed two distinct time series of catch and effort (n fish fisher- 1 trip- 1; <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> fisher- 1 trip- 1) for recreational fishing trips and fishing club competitions (mean n and <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> caught across all competitors, and n and <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> caught by the competition winner). Reported species composition remained similar over time. Catch rates reported from recreational fishing trips (1900 - 1998) displayed a significant decline, averaging 32. 5 fish fisher- 1 trip- 1 prior to 1960, and 18. 8 fish fisher- 1 trip- 1 post- 1960. Mean n fish fisher- 1 competition- 1 (1913 - 1983) also significantly declined, but best n fish fisher- 1 competition- 1 (1925 - 1980) displayed no significant change, averaging 31. 2 fish fisher- 1 competition- 1 over the time series. Mean and best <b>kg</b> <b>fish</b> fisher- 1 competition- 1 trends also displayed no significant change, averaging 4. 2 and 9. 9 kg fisher- 1 competition- 1, respectively. These variable trends suggest that while some fishers experienced diminishing returns in this region over the last few decades, the most skilled inshore fishers were able to maintain their catch rates, highlighting the difficulties inherent in crafting conservation messages that will resonate with all sections of a community.
