25|$|The {{most diverse}} group of labyrinthodonts was the Temnospondyli. Temnospondyls {{appeared}} the Late Devonian and came in all sizes, from small salamander-like Stereospondyli that scurried along the waters edge and undergrowth, to giant, well armoured Archegosauroidea that looked more like crocodiles. Prionosuchus was an exceptionally large member of the Archegosauridae, estimated to have been up to 9 meters long, {{it is the largest}} amphibian ever known to have lived. Temnospondyls typicall had large heads and <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulder</b> girdles with moderately long tails. A fossil trackway from Lesotho shows larger forms dragged themselves by the front limbs over slippery surfaces with limited sideways movement of the body, very unlike modern salamanders.|$|E
60|$|As {{they sat}} in the tramcar, she leaned her <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulder</b> against him, and he took her hand. He felt himself coming round from the anaesthetic, {{beginning}} to breathe. Her ear, half-hidden among her blonde hair, was near to him. The temptation to kiss it was almost too great. But there were other people on top of the car. It still remained to him to kiss it. After all, he was not himself, he was some attribute of hers, like the sunshine that fell on her.|$|E

50|$|The Department of Initial Entry Training (Assault and Colt Troops, 3-16 CAV) {{provides}} {{training to}} all Initial Entry Soldiers conducting Basic Combat or One Station Unit Training at Fort Benning. The Cadre provide {{training on the}} employment of machine guns (light, medium and <b>heavy),</b> <b>shoulder</b> launched munitions, mines, demolitions, grenade launchers and hand grenades, as well as training on basic soldier skills such as react to contact, land navigation, communications, first aid, and Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear (CBRN) protection. The Department of Initial Entry Training also provides training and training support to confidence and team building events at the Harmony Church Confidence Course, the Eagle and Thunderbolt Tower rappel sites, and the Harmony Church Team Development Course. The goal of the Department of Initial Entry Training is to provide world class, professional instruction and training support to every Initial Entry Soldier entering the US Army at Fort Benning and ensure the Maneuver Center provides the US Army with the best trained Infantry, Armor, and Cavalry Soldiers in the world.|$|E
40|$|Untreated Xenopus cells {{synthesize}} RNA {{is increased}} and some sequences complementary {{to those of}} the nontranscribed spacer are found in the <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the 40 S precursor rRNA peak. In such events transcription initiation seems to take place within the spacer because its middle and right BamHI endonuclease fragments are preferentially transcribed, whereas only few RNA sequences complementary to the left spacer fragment are found. It is concluded that at least some spacer regions contain promoters for transcription and can be transcribed either into a special class of "spacer transcripts" or into molecules covalently linked to rRNA precursor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNuchal-type fibroma (NTF) is a rare, benign {{subcutaneous}} tumor {{that usually}} {{arises from the}} posterior neck. NTF is histologically characterised by dense collagen bundles and sparse fibroblasts. Only four trauma-related cases have been previously published. Herein, we present a case of extra NTF with histopathology, and six palanquin porters by using snowball sampling technique in ethnographic field research. A palanquin {{is a type of}} human-powered transport carried upon the shoulders mostly seen in religious processions. All individuals (mean age, 26. 8 years) displayed similar shoulder masses measuring up to 12 cm in the greatest dimensions. They averaged approximately 8. 1 years of palanquin-carrying work each. We believe that long-term, <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulder</b> weight bearing of palanquins in religious dance performances may attribute to the incidence of extra NTF. This study reviews all literature of trauma-associated NTF through PubMed database, and highlights the association between repetitive blunt trauma and the development of NTF...|$|E

60|$|His {{waistcoat}} had {{the curve}} which waistcoats often describe at his age; and his <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> were thrown well back to balance this curve. His coat hung carelessly open; the Panama hat {{in his hand}} suggested a certain habitual informality of dress, but his smoothly shaven large handsome face, with its jaws slowly ruminant upon nothing, intimated the consequence of a man accustomed to supremacy in a subordinate place.|$|R

He is not sleek and graceful like his smaller cousin, but has an enormously thick neck and <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders.</b> His voice is a roar rather than a bark. The head of an old Sea Lion is so much like that of a true Lion that the name Sea Lion has been given this family.|$|R
40|$|Carcasses {{of twenty}} lambs (10 males and 10 females) from the Canaria Hair breed (CHB) and another twenty (10 males and 10 females) from the Canaria breed (CB) of 9. 91 ± 0. 73 kg and 9. 87 ± 0. 80 kg live weight, respectively, were studied. In the {{principal}} component (PC) analysis, {{the projection of}} carcass measurement data in the first PC allowed for clearly distinguishing between CB and CHB. In the analysis of variance, breed effect was observed in the morphology of the carcass: CB lambs showed the longest carcasses and CHB lambs showed the widest carcasses. Due to their wider rump and shorter legs, CHB lambs presented a more compact leg index. The carcasses from Canaria lambs had the highest fat score, the <b>heaviest</b> <b>shoulder</b> and the highest total fat percentage. The carcasses from CHB lambs showed a higher lean percentage. The carcass yield, conformation, degree of fatness and tissue composition were similar in both sexes. However, {{significant differences in the}} commercial cut yield were observed: males showed <b>heavier</b> <b>shoulders</b> than females. The effect of sex on carcass quality is unimportant. The breeds are different in important characteristics for the market, such as fatness. This fact is of significant interest because it diversifies the offer and means that different markets can be satisfied...|$|R
60|$|The brute looked up, and {{his companions}} halted behind him, scores and scores of red dogs with low-hung tails, <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders,</b> weak quarters, and bloody mouths. The dholes are a very silent people as a rule, {{and they have no}} manners even in their own Jungle. Fully two hundred must have {{gathered}} below him, but he could see that the leaders sniffed hungrily on Won-tolla's trail, and tried to drag the Pack forward. That would never do, or they would be at the Lairs in broad daylight, and Mowgli meant to hold them under his tree till dusk.|$|R
50|$|The murmillo's {{fighting}} {{style was}} suited for men with large muscular arms and strong <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> needed {{to carry the}} weight of the shield and sword and heavy helmet. Those who fought as murmillones were usually big tall men and always very muscular. The murmillo depended on his strength and endurance to survive the battle against foes who were more suited to attacking. The tower shield gave him an edge in defense and the gladius enabled him to thrust and swing at his enemies when in close range. The murmillones were also trained to kick their enemies with the thick padding worn around their legs.|$|R
60|$|His head hung so low {{between his}} <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> that it {{reminded}} me of a flower stooping for want of water. Not that there was anything limp or fragile or gentle in his looks. He was, far rather, clumsy and ugly in appearance, yet with a grace in his look like that of an old, haggled thorn-tree when the wind moves its branches. And anyhow, he was come to be my friend--out of the unknown. And when I looked around at the serene wild loveliness of the garden, it seemed to be no less happy a place because it was no longer quite a solitude.|$|R
60|$|It was {{one o'clock}} in the afternoon, but the day was gloomy. By {{the light of a}} single gas-jet {{depending}} from the smoked ceiling I saw an elderly man, in a long coat of black broadcloth. He had a grey beard, a big nose, thick lips, and <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders.</b> His curly white hair and the general character of his head recalled vaguely a burly apostle in the barocco style of Italian art. Standing up at a tall, shabby, slanting desk, his silver-rimmed spectacles pushed up high on his forehead, he was eating a mutton-chop, which had been just brought to him from some Dickensian eating-house round the corner.|$|R
50|$|The Kytos {{uses the}} spear as their weapon. They use {{various parts of}} <b>heavy</b> armor (<b>shoulder</b> pads, etc.) as {{defensive}} clothing. In some areas (such as their chests) they are not covered in armor however, which allows them to be incredibly mobile in battle.|$|R
60|$|His {{hair was}} chestnut-brown, {{glinting in the}} candle-light to gold, and the hint of {{waviness}} in it explained the perceptible droop to his tawny moustache. For the rest, his face was clean-shaven and cut on a good masculine pattern. At first she found fault with the more than slight cheek-hollows under the cheek-bones, but when she measured his well-knit, slenderly muscular figure, with its deep chest and <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders,</b> she discovered that she preferred the hollows; at least they did not imply lack of nutrition. The body gave the lie to that; while they themselves denied the vice of over-feeding. Height, five feet, nine, she summed up from out of her gymnasium experience; and age anywhere between twenty-five and thirty, though nearer the former most likely.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Mr. Gorse, {{and nodded}} toward me. I was {{impressed}} by the felicity with which a cartoonist of the Pilot had once caricatured him by the use of curved lines. The circle of the heavy eyebrows ended at the wide nostrils; the mouth was a crescent, but bowed downwards; the <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> were rounded. Indeed, the only straight line to be discerned about him was that of his hair, black as bitumen, banged across his forehead; even his polished porphyry eyes were constructed on some curvilinear principle, and never seemed to focus. It might be said of Mr. Gorse that he had an overwhelming impersonality. One could never be quite sure that one's words reached the mark.|$|R

60|$|The {{newspapers}} calculated Martin's royalties. In {{some way}} the magnificent offers certain magazines {{had made him}} leaked out, and Oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional begging letters began to clutter his mail. But worse than all this were the women. His photographs were published broadcast, and special writers exploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders,</b> his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his cheeks like an ascetic's. At this last he remembered his wild youth and smiled. Often, among the women he met, he would see now one, now another, looking at him, appraising him, selecting him. He laughed to himself. He remembered Brissenden's warning and laughed again. The women would never destroy him, that much was certain. He had gone past that stage.|$|R

50|$|In {{the studio}} {{the girls are}} {{evaluated}} by the panel, with Anastasia being praised for her elegant body position. Sabrina manages to redeem herself in Nadeges eyes by producing a sophisticated pose and facial expression, thus earning appreciation from the judges. Marianna and Giorgia {{on the other hand}} are not positively judged for being too technical in their poses, Giusi points out Giorgias face comes out vulgar in her shot and the panel agrees Mariannas facial expression is not well defined. Michael criticizes both girls for posing in a forced way. Caroline is noticed for her beauty that is once again her best asset, but Nadege is still unsatisfied by her lack of effort in posing, stating that the girl relies on it and does not give something more which is required in a fashion photo. Anisia disappoints Natasha and Michael for her <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> position and not having presence in her shot, even if her facial expression works.|$|R

40|$|European and Italian {{legislation}} {{have banned}} use of growth promoters in livestock since 1988, but epidemiological {{data show that}} anabolic drugs are still being used illegally. Recent surveys carried out on the cattle farms in Northern Italy have confirmed the presence of growthpromoting hormones. Authors report data on growth performances in 80 Valle del Belice×Comisana weaned lambs experimentally treated with 17 beta-estradiol with 0. 5 ml solution of oil Depot Estradiol ® (containing 5 mg of 17 β- estradiol valerate) by intramuscular injection into the thigh. The experiment was founded by the National Ministry of Health, to validate histological test for surveillance and control of growth-promoting hormones in sheep. This study confirmed the strong correlation between clinical and anatomopathological features and growth performances of treated animals. Otherwise, {{no significant differences were}} found on in vivo performance of the lambs. Estradiol treatment showed <b>heavier</b> <b>shoulders</b> and necks on treated lambs, while the loins were significantly lighter. Moreover, lambestradiol- treated groups showed lower separable and inseparable fat percentage than lamb-control groups...|$|R
60|$|Taking {{the turn}} of the garden quite naturally, he had lifted his eyes to the moon, by this time risen big and luminous, and had seen a huge, half-human figure sitting on the garden wall. It was {{outlined}} so sharply against the moon that for the first flash it was hard to be certain even that it was human: the hunched shoulders and outstanding hair had rather the air of a colossal cat. It resembled a cat also in the fact that when first startled it sprang up and ran with easy activity {{along the top of the}} wall. As it ran, however, its <b>heavy</b> <b>shoulders</b> and small stooping head rather suggested a baboon. The instant it came within reach of a tree it made an ape-like leap and was lost in the branches. The gale, which by this time was shaking every shrub in the garden, made the identification yet more difficult, since it melted the moving limbs of the fugitive in the multitudinous moving limbs of the tree.|$|R

40|$|In their far-flung peregrinations the Chemehuevi {{undoubtedly}} {{encountered the}} buffalo {{and came to}} know of tribes who lived by the buffalo.

Of the thirty-odd Chemehuevi texts of myths dictated between May 1919 and May 1920 by my informant, George Laird (who later became my husband), only two make mention of this animal. One of these is a story of the travels of Southern Fox (Tantivaiyipatsi). George Laird entitled it "Southern Fox Went Across Fire Valley. " He said frankly that he had constructed it out of four remembered fragments which he thought "belonged together. " In the tale as he told it, Southern Fox travels in a semicircle from his home on Whipple Mountain south to Blythe Intake, northwest across the Mohave River, then north to and across Death Valley. The third episode only will be given here, for it is only in this section that a buffalo is mentioned...|$|R
