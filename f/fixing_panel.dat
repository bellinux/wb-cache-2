40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy supply {{is required in}} Malaysia to meet the increasing electricity demand with rapid growing in population and economy. Photovoltaic solar panel is most suitable alternative way to generate electricity in Malaysia where most of its location receives large number of solar radiation throughout the year. However, <b>fixed</b> solar <b>panel</b> is more preferred than tracking panel because it is cost effective. In present work, the power output and efficiency of single-axis tracking solar panel is compared with <b>fixed</b> solar <b>panel</b> by experimentally in East Coast Malaysia. A single-axis tracking panel produces higher power output than <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> up to 28 W. During this time, the average efficiency of tracking panel was about 66. 70 % and <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> was 39. 96 %. Hence, the percentage increment on average power output using tracking panel reached up to 66. 92 % compare to <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> during this period. The tracking panel module efficiency was higher than <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> {{for the same period}} and can reach up to 28. 9 % at 6. 00 p. m. In conclusion, single-axis tracking panel is more efficient than <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> in premeridian and postmeridian. Thus, it produces higher power output than <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> which means it utilize the most of available solar radiation effectively and this will reduce payback period of the initial investment cost...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the gain in {{extraterrestrial}} radiation received by a single-axis tracked panel {{relative to a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> was systematically analyzed over a specific period of time. The dynamic angle that the tracked panel should rotate by in order to follow the sun was derived {{through a series of}} spherical trigonometric procedures. The instantaneous incident angle of sunlight upon the panel was then calculated, assuming that the panel would simultaneously follow the sun's position. Thus, instantaneous increments of solar energy received by the tracked panel relative to the <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> are originally presented. The results show that the angle the tracked panel has to rotate by is 0 Â° at solar noon, and increases towards dawn or dusk. The incident angle of sunlight upon the tracked panel is always smaller than that upon the <b>fixed</b> <b>panel,</b> except at solar noon. As for panels installed with a yearly optimal tilt angle in Taipei, the gains are between 36. 3 % and 62. 1 % for four particular days of year, between 37. 8 % and 60. 8 % for the four seasons and 49. 3 % over the entire year. The amount of radiation collected by the tracked panel is enhanced as the maximum rotation angle is increased. The irradiation ratio of the tracked <b>panel</b> to the <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> is close to 1. 5 for latitudes below 65 Â° and gradually increases for latitudes above this. The yearly optimal tilt angle of a south-facing <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> is approximately equal to 0. 9 multiplied by the latitude (i. e. 0. 9 Â xÂ [phi]) for latitudes below 65 Â° and is about 56 Â +Â  0. 4 Â xÂ ([phi]Â -Â  65) otherwise.

40|$|Abstract The {{fossil fuel}} is a main {{issue in the}} world due to the {{increase}} of fossil fuel cost and the depletion of the fossil fuel with continuous increasing demand on electricity. With continuous decrease of PV panels cost {{it is interesting to}} consider generation of electricity from PV system. To provide electric energy to a load in a remote area where electric grid utility is not available or connection with grid utility is available there are two approaches of photovoltaic system PV without tracking system Fixed System and PV with tracking systems. The result shows that the energy production by using PV with tracking system generates more energy in comparison with <b>fixed</b> <b>panels</b> system. However the cost per produced KWH is less in case of using <b>fixed</b> <b>panels.</b> This is the backbone in choice between two approaches of photovoltaic system. In this work a system design and cost analysis for two approaches of photovoltaic system are considered...|$|R

40|$|Analysts are {{commonly}} {{called upon to}} perform {{the difficult task of}} evaluating the effects of specific changes in public policy upon the behavior of individuals, such as a change in the provisions of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program relating to the benefits of those in the program who find work. When charged with such a task, analysts commonly try to answer the question by tracing the behavior of a <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> of individuals, comparing the experience of the group before and after the change in policy. That approach, however, risks major errors; {{in the case of the}} AFDC program, for instance, changes in the work benefit provisions affected the decisions of some who might have come into the program, a consequence that would not be picked up by a <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> of initial recipients. Cross-sectional data drawn independently from a general population at points in time before and after a policy change can often provide a more valid measure of the effects of the policy change than can panel data; moreover, cross-sectional data are usually less expensive and more readily available. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, new {{analytic}} {{models are}} proposed for mapping on-site {{global solar radiation}} values to electrical power output values in solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. The model extraction is achieved by simultaneously recording solar radiation and generated power from <b>fixed</b> and tracking <b>panels,</b> each with capacity of 3 kW, in Eskisehir (Turkey) region. It is shown that {{the relation between the}} solar radiation and the corresponding electric power is not only nonlinear, but it also exhibits an interesting time-varying characteristic {{in the form of a}} hysteresis function. This observed radiation-to-power relation is, then, analytically modelled with three piece-wise function parts (corresponding to morning, noon and evening times), which is another novel contribution of this work. The model is determined for both <b>fixed</b> <b>panels</b> and panels with a tracking system. Especially the panel system with a dynamic tracker produces a harmonically richer (with higher values in general) characteristic, so higher order polynomial models are necessary for the construction of analytical solar radiation models. The presented models, characteristics of the hysteresis functions, and differences in the <b>fixed</b> versus solar-tracking <b>panels</b> are expected to provide valuable insight for further model based researches...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though a}} fixed flat-panel {{can be set}} to collect a high {{proportion}} of available noon-time energy, significant power is also available in the early mornings and late afternoons when the misalignment with a <b>fixed</b> <b>panel</b> becomes excessive to collect a reasonable proportion of the available energy. For example, even when the Sun is only 10° above the horizon the available energy can be around half the noon-time energy levels (or even greater depending on latitude, season, and atmospheric conditions).|$|R
