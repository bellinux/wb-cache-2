This delay on crosslinking reaction enables the observation of the various stages of the morphological mechanism that takes place during dynamic vulcanisation.

50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber</b> and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubber.</b> Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|E

Two EPDM formulations, containing additives typically employed in <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubbers,</b> were analyzed. Initially, gaseous pyrolysis products from paraffin oil, stearic acid, 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), and 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) were characterized separately, and their main absorptions were identified. Subsequently, the gaseous pyrolysis products of raw, unvulcanized, and vulcanized EPDM formulations were analyzed. The similarities observed in the FT-IR spectra of unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM show that the vulcanization process does {{not interfere with the}} pyrolysis products. The identification of the functional groups of the studied additives was possible in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM samples, without solvent extraction. Results also demonstrate that the PY-G/FT-IR technique can identify additives containing sulfur in concentrations as low as 1. 4 phr (1. 26 %) in both unvulcanized and vulcanized EPDM. However, the method showed some limitation due to overlapping and to similarities of TMTM and TMTD PY-G/FT-IR spectra, which could not be distinguished from each other. The PY-G/FT-IR technique is a faster and cheaper alternative to the sophisticated techniques usually applied to detection of additives in rubbers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present work proposes an {{approach}} to identify the network structural evolution of <b>EPDM</b> <b>rubbers</b> induced by loading. An experimental device based on two camera pair systems has been developed in order to accurately measure the volume change of rubber samples during stretching. Results show that the loading is associated with an increase of volume change (∆V/V 0) up to 2 % and should be related to cavitation/decohesion at the interface between fillers and the rubbery matrix. Post mortem analysis of the microstructure, combining swelling and thermoporosimetry experiments, were then carried out. A good agreement has been found between the volume change and the microstructural evolution: as compared to virgin samples (not submitted to loading), the effective network density estimated from swelling measurements of tested materials (ν) is decreased of 7 % and thermoporosimetry shows that damage during stretching is accompanied by an average increase of the chains length. These changes are significantly increased for samples stretched up to the rupture (λ= 8). Indeed, in that case, the effective network density is decreased of more than 20 %...|$|R
