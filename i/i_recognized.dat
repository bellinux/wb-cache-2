5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a {{criminal}} element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

25|$|Because that {{protest and}} my {{communications}} to the United States Government immediately thereafter expressly declare that I yielded my {{authority to the}} forces of the United States in order to avoid bloodshed, and because <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> the futility of a conflict with so formidable a power.|$|E
25|$|In the {{negotiations}} which followed Henry <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> Gruffudd's ancestral claims of Môn, Arfon, Llŷn, Dunoding (Eifionydd and Ardudwy) and Arllechwedd (Môn, Caernarfonshire and northern Merionethshire), {{the lands of}} upper Gwynedd to the Conwy which were already firmly in Gruffudd's control. Cadwgan regained Ceredigion, and {{his share of the}} family inheritance in Powys, from the new earl of Shrewsbury, Robert of Bellême.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E

25|$|In late 1098 Gruffudd and Cadwgan {{landed in}} Wales and {{recovered}} Angelsey without much difficulty, with Hervé the Breton fleeing Bangor for safety in England. Over {{the course of}} the next three years, Gruffudd was able to recover upper Gwynedd to the Conwy, defeating Hugh, Earl of Chester. In 1101, after Earl Hugh's death, Gruffudd and Cadwgan came to terms with England's new king, Henry I, who was consolidating his own authority and also eager to come to terms. In the negotiations which followed Henry <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> Gruffudd's ancestral claims of Angelsey, Llŷn, Dunoding (Eifionydd and Ardudwy) and Arllechwedd, being the lands of upper Gwynedd to the Conwy which were already firmly in Gruffudd's control.

The {{star of the}} show Jon Provost later recalled, [...] "As young as I was, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> how much that dog meant to Rudd. Rudd loved that old dog as much as anyone could love an animal or person." ...|$|E

Sonia Munder had no difficulty recognizing the sneakers of her children, one of Christian age 14 and one of Lisi age 17, by the intricate way her children laced them. Another mother says, [...] "I recognized them just like that. You see, {{there are all kinds}} of inconspicuous marks which strangers do not notice. This is how <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> them. My daughter loved to wear them." ...|$|E

Sasha Alexander's character Kate Todd was killed in the second season finale [...] "Twilight", and Glasberg said [...] "it’s not what this character deserves". He also said that Ziva's departure [...] "is a storyline that I took very, very seriously — I felt like I had to, for the fans. <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> what this means to them, and <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> what her absence is going to mean." ...|$|R

[...] The court recognized that [...] "umerous decisions of this Court prior to Oneida <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> at least implicitly that Indians have a federal common-law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights," [...] citing a string of examples back to Johnson v.

Do per ora il semplice annunzio del fatto, proponendomi di ritornare sopra questo argomento, dopo di aver sottoposta la sublimazione ad una analisi chimica. (I collected some time ago an amorphous substance having a buttery consistency and a faded yellow color which had sublimated on the rim of a fumarole near the mouth of the eruption. Having analyzed this sublimated substance with a spectroscope, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> the lines of sodium and potassium and a very distinct linear line which corresponds exactly to D3, which is that of helium. For the present, I'm making a mere announcement of the fact, proposing to return to this subject after having subjected the sublimate to a chemical analysis.) }} ...|$|E
500|$|Dick became {{concerned}} {{that no one}} had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. He said, [...] "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." [...] He also approved of the film's script, saying, [...] "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." [...] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.|$|E

2500|$|As Professor Goodman {{describes}} him, Karl Terzaghi was {{a remarkable}} man and an impassioned engineer. As he put it himself, “All the modest achievements which I have to my credit can be described by a simple formula… Guided by common sense and casual observations, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> weak points in traditional procedures {{and tried to make}} them less weak.

2500|$|The author {{continued}} {{his work at}} the Institute before and after 1875, when it merged with the [...] "New High School" [...] into the private-run Institutele-Unite ("Unified Institutes").
