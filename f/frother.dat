40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{flotation}} behaviour of copper shale-quartz mixed {{particles in the}} presence of different <b>frothers.</b> Flotation tests were conducted in a laboratory sized self-areated mechanical flotation machine. It was found that shale was very floatable and quartz was not. Different hydrophobicities and contact angles of quartz and shale were very likely responsible for their flotation behaviour and separation results. Three <b>frothers</b> tested for shale flotation: MIBC, butanol and C 16 E 20 are all suitable for shale flotation as they all have good shale recovery at suitable concentrations. MIBC is recommended for use due to its reasonable recovery at 40 g/Mg which is a low dosage. MIBC has the highest rate constant at a low concentration but other <b>frothers</b> tend to accelerate shale flotation more at high concentrations. It was noticed that C 16 E 20 has the highest rate constant at middle concentrations. The entrainment degree of mixed ore flotation can be detected by measuring quartz recovery or water recovery. It was found shale flotation is a real flotation process rather than entrainment. It was also found that critical coalesce concentration, also called CCC 95, is a very useful way to compare flotation results for different <b>frothers.</b> The dosage and concentration are not suitable for a direct comparison of action of flotation <b>frothers</b> because the separation results using such scales are significantly scattered...|$|R

Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus (Thiobacillus) ferrooxidans are ubiquitous bacteria in the biomining industry. To date, the effects of commercial flotation reagents on the biooxidation activities of these bacteria have not been thoroughly studied.

40|$|Natural oils such as {{pine oil}} and {{eucalyptus}} oil {{were used in}} metalliferrous flotation, principally as <b>frothers,</b> {{in the early days}} of flotation In recent years synthetic collectors and <b>frothers</b> have taken over, largely because the complex chemistry and wide variation in natural oils results in poor control of their consistency as flotation reagents. Australia, however, has enormous potential as a supplier of eucalyptus oils. If one or more eucalypt species were identified as desirable sources of coal flotation reagents, it would be logical to cultivate them in industrial plantations on mine sites and to have this form of land use accepted as a satisfactory end point for rehabilitation. Such an outcome would have multiple benefits for the mining industry. Essential oils derived from eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8).

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. In 2012, Anglo American Platinum {{assembled}} a technical task team of metallurgists for their concentrator operations. Although {{there has been}} extensive research in literature regarding the flotation response and behaviour of reagents, there still exists a gap between fundamental laboratory scale research and plant scale application. This thesis {{will focus on the}} development of techniques for optimising and characterising <b>frother</b> on a full scale plant using the Anglo American Platinum Bubble Sizer (AAPBS) which is a commonly used tool by the plant metallurgist. The techniques developed have been based on the application of fundamental research of frothers in literature. This thesis consists of three main focus areas: 1) Developing a technique for measuring the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and <b>frother</b> concentration on a full scale plant. 2) Developing a technique for estimating <b>frother</b> concentrations in process streams in full scale plant 3) Establishing whether the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and superficial gas velocity in a flotation bank of identical cells in series in a plant operating at <b>frother</b> concentration above the CCC is identical, and whether this can be used to detect the decrease of <b>frother</b> concentration to below the CCC at any point in the bank. Furthermore, the metallurgical performance of a bank with a decrease in <b>frother</b> concentration below the CCC midway through the bank was determined before and after the addition of <b>frother,</b> which was added as such that all the cells in the bank operate with a <b>frother</b> concentration above the CCC. There were two techniques investigated for measuring the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and <b>frother</b> concentration. Both techniques involved using the AAPBS and the use of forced air mechanically agitated tank cells. Technique 1 involved using the first rougher cell on a flotation plant, dosing <b>frother</b> at different rates into the cell to target different <b>frother</b> concentrations and then measuring the resultant bubble size whilst operating at a fixed air rate. The coalescence mechanism here was occurring in a three phase solids/aqueous/air system occurring in a continuous stirred tank. Similarly Technique 2 involved using the first rougher cell; however, the first cell was depleted of <b>frother</b> by bypassing the <b>frother</b> dosage line into the next cell. This was done to isolate the first rougher cell and to minimise disturbance {{to the rest of the}} rougher bank. Known concentrations offrother were made up in potable water and these were added into the AAPBS. Bubbles from the pulp phase enter the bubble riser tube which is long and narrow (3 m x 25 mm diameter) which is representative of two phase aqueous/air “plug flow” system. These bubbles coalesce to different degrees based on the known <b>frother</b> concentration. The resulting bubble size distribution was then be measured by taking photographs at the viewing pane of the AAPBS. The air rate in the cell was kept constant to within 0. 7 - 0. 9 cm/s and the photographs were analysed using software provided by stone three to determine the sauter mean bubble diameter and the bubble size distribution. Technique 1 was applied to Plant A UG 2 concentrator which was using a polyglycol type <b>frother</b> called Betafroth 206 C which has an undisclosed composition and a molecular weight of approximately 200 g/mol. The first rougher cell used was an Outokumpu 70 m 3 forced air mechanically agitated tank cell. The results showed no clear relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and <b>frother</b> concentration. Furthermore, the sauter mean bubble diameter was already very small and it appeared that the changes in between runs were more strongly linked to the superficial gas velocity than <b>frother</b> concentration. The fact that the sauter mean bubble diameter obtained was already small implied that the <b>frother</b> concentration in the cell was already high. This could have been due to an additional source of <b>frother</b> due to spillage or in the process water that potentially elevated the actual <b>frother</b> concentrations in the cell. Technique 1 also resulted in significant disturbances to the entire rougher bank because it involved changing the <b>frother</b> dosages to the bank. This would affect the flotation performance of the bank for a prolonged period and affect plant performance. Hence it was decided that technique 1 would not be suitable...|$|E

The physical properties of the foaming systems versus the surfactant concentration were experimentally determined for the surface tension, bubble size, and interfacial viscosity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{selected}} cationic surfactants {{were tested in}} order to a valuate their possible use as flotation reagents.

Therefore, it is recommended to keep the surfactant concentration {{in the vicinity of}} CCC to prevent the occurrence of the coalescence phenomenon. Basing on the performed research it can be concluded that: 1. plotted graphs show that the coalescence disappears along with the increasing concentrations of the surfactants, 2. for all tested surfactants the values of critical coalescence concentrations (CCC) are similar and are in the range from 0. 041 to 0. 048 mmol/dm 3, 3. the analysis of both obtained CCC values based on arithmetic and Sauter diameters demonstrates that no considerable variation of the CCC values was observed for the tested surfactants, 4. diameters of air bubbles measured for quaternary ammonium compounds containing a hydrophobic moiety with an ester group and for typical floatation <b>frothers</b> known under the trade name of Dowfroth gave similar CCC values. 5. the CCC values can be an important material constants for foaming agents. Determination of possibility to use cationic surfactants as flotation <b>frothers</b> and their impact on flotation efficiency should help to select appropriate flotation reagents so that, in addition to typical, already known <b>frothers,</b> other environment-friendly surfactants may be used in mineral processing technology.

The surfactants used represent quaternary ammonium compounds containing a hydrophobic moiety with an ester group (commonly known as “esterquats”).

40|$|Concentrators {{processing}} platinum group mineral (PGM) bearing ores use polysaccharide depressants {{to reduce}} {{the recovery of the}} naturally floatable gangue minerals (mainly silicates) present in the ores. Recent work has shown that high depressant dosage can completely depress the naturally floatable gangue from reporting to the concentrate. Unfortunately, this high dosage of depressant can {{have a negative effect on}} the recovery of valuable minerals present in the ore by reducing the stability of the froth. In order to counterbalance the negative effects of depressant addition, frothers are normally added. The optimum <b>frother</b> provides a balance between the pulp kinetics and the froth recovery (through the effect of the <b>frother</b> on the bubble size and froth stability, respectively) over the range of <b>frother</b> addition. Usually one <b>frother</b> is added to accomplish this but using only one <b>frother</b> gives only one unique hydrodynamic relationship. It would be preferable to have independent control over the bubble size and froth stability, but unfortunately this cannot be achieved because changing the concentration of the <b>frother</b> changes both responses. An alternative strategy for gaining more independent control over the froth characteristics and bubble size would be to use a blend of frothers, such as a weak and a stronger <b>frother.</b> Such a system would give an additional degree of freedom so that changing the ratio of the two frothers would provide more independent control of bubble Sauter mean diameter and froth stability. Little research work has been conducted on <b>frother</b> blends and none suggests the mechanism of blended <b>frother</b> action.

The Merensky reef contains approximately 1 % sulphides {{in the form of}} chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite, and the PGE’s are strongly associated with these sulphides. Different operations use different reagent suites (collectors, depressants, activators and <b>frothers)</b> in the flotation process to extract the valuable minerals from their section of the reef. Batch flotation tests were done on two ores from different parts of the reef using three different reagent suites based on the typical suites presently in use, and the recovery of the sulphide and gangue minerals compared. The two ores responded in a similar manner to the three reagent suites although there were differences observed in the behaviour of the individual minerals. These differences and the reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|R
