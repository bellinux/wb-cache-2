Results of experimental investigations on adhesion strength of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> manufactured in the Republic of Belarus with concrete have been given in the paper. The paper contains an analysis pertaining to the influence of concrete contact diameter and length of fiberglass reinforcing bars on strength and deformability of adhesion with concrete. Failure behavior of prototypes and maximum loading that does cause breakage in adhesion of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> with the concrete have been controlled in order to study the influence of diameter and length of fiberglass reinforcing bar contact with the concrete on strength and deformability of concrete adhesion for composite reinforcement produced by various manufacturers. Displacement of non-loaded (free) and loaded ends of the reinforcing bars with regard to concrete exposed face on both specimen ends has been also controlled. The experiments have shown that destruction of the prototypes occurred due to initiation of one of the following three reasons: reinforcement sliding in reference to concrete, cleaving of a protective concrete layer or breakage of composite reinforcement. Start-up moments for reinforcing bar slip in relation to the concrete have been determined with the help of two methods.

40|$|Predictability of a {{structural}} design’s performance {{is one of}} many important purposes of structural analysis. Elastic analysis of structures requires that very specific conditions at all points within the structure and on its boundary are satisfied. Forces of action and reaction must be in equilibrium, deformations of adjacent points within and on the boundaries of {{a structural}} element must be compatible, and only appropriate stress-strain laws may be employed. If, and only if, displacements of a linear elastic material are small, analysis may be relied upon to be a powerful predictor of performance. Properly designed steel girders experience service displacements of about 0. 5 %. Corrugated flexible steel, aluminum and plastic pipes experience service displacements of about 5 %. The larger the displacement, the less reliable are the predictions. To enhance performance, structures and structural elements are often designed as composites of multiple materials. Familiar examples include reinforcing bars in concrete and <b>fiberglass</b> filament <b>reinforcement</b> of pressure vessels of thermosetting resins.

40|$|Fourteen foam {{insulation}} specimens were tested. Some were plain foam while others contained flame retardants, chopped <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and/or vapor barriers. The thermal {{performance of the}} insulation was determined by measuring {{the rate at which}} LH 2 boiled from an aluminum tank insulated with the test material. The test specimens were approximately 50 mm (2 in.) thick. They were structurally scaled so that the test cycle would duplicate the maximum thermal stresses predicted for the thicker insulation of an aircraft liquid hydrogen fuel tank during a typical subsonic flight. The simulated flight cycle of approximately 10 minutes duration heated the other insulation surface to 316 K (110 F) and cooled it to 226 K (20 F) while the inner insulation surface remained at liquid hydrogen temperature of 20 K (- 423 F). Two urethane {{foam insulation}}s exceeded the initial life goal of 2400 simulated flight cycles and sustained 4400 cycles with only minor damage. The addition of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of flame retardant materials to an insulation degraded thermal performance and/or the life of the foam material.

40|$|Bolted {{connections}} {{often fail}} by a shear plug or a splitting beneath the bolt caused by tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses as the bolt wedges {{its way through}} the wood. Pre-venting this type of failure would enhance the capacity and reliability of the bolted connection, thus increasing the over-all integrity of a timber structure and enabling wood to compete favorably with other engineering materials. This research investigated the use of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to enhance the load-carrying capacity of bolted wood connec-tions. A series of specimens were prepared from standard 38 - by 89 -mm (nominal 2 - by 4 -in.) lumber from the Spruce–Pine–Fir lumber grouping. Matched specimens were reinforced with one, two, or three layers of bi-directional fiberglass cloth. Resulting test specimens were configured as a connection that was in accordance with current design specifications. A total of 80 single-bolt, double-shear connec-tions were tested; 40 parallel to grain and 40 perpendicular to grain. Results indicate that connection strength increases as the layers of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>reinforcement</b> increase. The largest in-crease occurred when adding the first layer to the nonrein-forced connection. Additional layers increased strength at a decreasing rate. The ultimate strength of a three-layer rein-forced connection was 33 percent greater than the nonrein-forced connection for parallel-to grain loading and more than 100 percent for perpendicular-to-grain loading. More impor-tantly for parallel-to-grain loading, the reinforcement changed the mode of failure from an abrupt, catastrophic type associ-ated with tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses to a ductile type associated with bearing stress...|$|E

Aerospace quality composite materials typically have greater strength and stiffness to weight ratios than most metals, while providing increased damping.

The <b>reinforcements</b> are impregnated with a series of polyurethane elastomers that range from flexible to rigid in hardness. For a given type of fiberglass, the lower durometer elastomer produced the highest loss factor. For a given elastomer stiffness, the stiffest reinforcement produced the highest damping. In general the skin loss factors are inversely proportional to the equivalent axial in-plane stiffness of the composite. Skin loss factors range from 1. 5 % to approximately 20 %.

Due to the importance of epoxy resin and its use in industrial processes will be considered object of study in this project. Despite of these advantages, other challenges to overcome are the {{development of}} cheaper production process and new techniques of processing to the manufacturing of components with structural functions; one of them is the resin infusion which is based on the impregnation of thin films of dry fabrics through resin, this technique uses vacuum pressure to drive resin into laminate. Materials are laid dry into the mold and the vacuum is applied before resin is introduced. This process improves the quality and strength of the laminate <b>reinforcement</b> (<b>fiberglass)</b> of the parts. During the resin impregnation process, the vacuum causes the nucleation and formation of air bubbles from gases dissolved in the resin.
