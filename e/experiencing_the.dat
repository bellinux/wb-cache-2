Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.

5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E
5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. Reid took {{measures}} to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery {{was beyond the}} capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E

5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E

The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E
