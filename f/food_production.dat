5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; <b>food</b> <b>production</b> remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in <b>food</b> <b>production</b> since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and <b>food</b> <b>production</b> have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, <b>food</b> <b>production</b> often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{provides}} an overview of the types of factors that may lead to the decertification of organic products, and the current regulatory scheme to evaluate and adjudicate potential violations. The underlying rationale for the enforcement of the Organic <b>Foods</b> <b>Production</b> Act of 1990 may lie in protection of the integrity of the product, as well as protection of the environmental system that is integral to its production. However, the risk factors for transitioning the U. S. food economy to a larger market share in order for organic food to reach a broader population could be an unintended disincentive. Part II of this Article discusses the origins of the organic movement. It also delineates the legal framework governing organic production in the United States—the Organic <b>Foods</b> <b>Production</b> Act and National Organic Program regulations. Part II also discusses the requirements and procedures governing the organic certification process, as well as who does and does not need to obtain certification. Lastly, Part II discusses the enforcement and appeals provisions set forth under the Organic <b>Foods</b> <b>Production</b> Act and National Organic Program regulations. Part III of this Article analyzes appeals to the National Organic Program, the majority of which involve the failure to comply with procedural requirements of the Organic <b>Foods</b> <b>Production</b> Act and implementing regulations and the use of prohibited materials in production. Part IV concludes with projections of the continued growth of the organic industry and the impact that various risk factors have on such growth...|$|R

5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global <b>food</b> <b>production</b> (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Food {{culture is}} a kind of non-material culture with authenticity. To achieve {{sustainable}} development of translocal heritage and food culture, we must protect its authenticity. By selecting the cases of the Dongbeiren Flavor Dumpling Restaurant and the Daozanjia Northeast Dumpling Restaurant and using the in-depth interview method, this study discusses how northeastern Cuisine in Guangzhou balances the inheritance and innovation of authenticity, how producers and customers negotiate, and how to realize sustainable development. The main conclusions are: first, there are two different paths of translocal <b>food</b> culture <b>production,</b> which are “authentic food culture production” and “differentiated food culture production”. Second, what translocal enterprises produce is not objective authenticity, but constructive authenticity, or even existential authenticity. Third, compared with differentiated <b>food</b> culture <b>production,</b> authentic <b>food</b> culture <b>production</b> is helpful for the sustainable development of local <b>food</b> culture <b>production.</b> It protects the locality while transmitting and developing the local culture.

5|$|The rush of {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.

There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased <b>food</b> <b>production</b> for internal consumption.
