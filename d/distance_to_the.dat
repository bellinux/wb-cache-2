5|$|The <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades {{can be used}} as an {{important}} first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

Continuing northward, NY270 enters {{the center of}} the hamlet, intersecting with the termini of both CR40 (Beach Ridge Road) and CR121 (Feigle Road) at the same intersection. After Pendleton Center, NY270 bends northeast running along Campbell Boulevard through the town of Pendleton as a two-lane residential street. Serving the eastern terminus of CR32 (Mapleton Road), NY270 begins bending north, intersecting with CR6 (Lockport Road).|$|E
5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. The ribbon for the access zone was cut by the governor's wife, then the officials walked a short <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E

NY317 then intersects with Whiting Road (CR183), which heads to the east, before entering the village of Jordan.|$|E
5|$|A short <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south-west}} of {{the castle}} is a barracks block and associated storage buildings, constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to convert it into a magazine, it has changed little externally in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E
5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a short <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor {{and to other}} buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed {{and was replaced by}} an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
