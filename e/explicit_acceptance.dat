40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} {{a preliminary report}} from a larger project examining the role of adult reformulations of children's utterances. Adult reformulations appear to serve two roles simultaneously in adult-child conversations: they provide a means whereby adult speakers can check up on what a child meant by what he said, and they offer a conventional way of expressing what the child appeared to have meant on each occasion. Analysis of two corpora, one French and one English, showed that adults {{are more likely to}} reformulate erroneous child utterances than conventional, grammatical ones, and that they produce many more reformulations when the children are younger and in fact producing a higher proportion of errors. Evidence that children attend to and make use of adult reformulations can be adduced from their acceptances and rejections of reformulations. While children tacitly accept most adult reformulations as next turns in the conversation, they also offer <b>explicit</b> <b>acceptances,</b> with overt uptake in their own next turns, and explicit rejections, where the adult has misunderstood what the child was trying to say. This suggests that adult reformulations provide an essential ingredient in the process of acquisition. The contrast between child and adult forms offers children data relevant to changing their own internal representations in memory, and so moving the forms of their emerging language ever closer to the patterns of adult usage in the community around them.

Our algorithm for recognizing discourse actions combines linguistic, world, and con-textual knowledge in a unified framework. By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to model negotiation subdialogues.

40|$|Abstract As {{early as}} 1902, Gibbs {{pointed out that}} systems whose {{partition}} function diverges, e. g. gravitation, lie outside {{the validity of the}} Boltzmann–Gibbs (BG) theory. Consistently, since the pioneering Bekenstein–Hawking results, physically meaningful evidence (e. g., the holographic principle) has accumulated that the BG entropy SBG of a (3 + 1) black hole is proportional to its area L 2 (L being a characteristic linear length), and not to its volume L 3. Similarly it exists the area law, sonamedbecause,forawideclass of strongly quantum-entangled d-dimensional systems, SBG is proportional to ln L if d = 1, and to L d− 1 if d> 1, instead of being proportional to L d (d ≥ 1). These results violate the extensivity of the thermodynamical entropy of a d-dimensional system. This thermodynamical inconsistency disappears if we realize that the thermodynamical entropy of such nonstandard systems is not to be identified with the BG additive entropy but with appropriately generalized nonadditive entropies. Indeed, the celebrated usefulness of the BG entropy is founded on hypothesis such as relatively weak probabilistic correlations (and their connections to ergodicity, which by no means can be assumed as a general rule of nature). Here we introduce a generalized entropy which, for the Schwarzschild black hole and the area law, can solve the thermodynamic puzzle. 1 Introduction The entropy of a black hole presents intriguing aspects that are being currently discussed since several decades. Indeed, since the pioneering works of Bekenstein [1, 2] andHawking [3, 4], it has become frequent in the literature the (<b>explicit</b> or tacit) <b>acceptance</b> that the black-hole entropy is anomalous {{in the sense that it}} violates thermodynamical extensivity [5 – 20].

The study aims to collect and summarize the CR strategies by Chinese college students. An overall distribution is presented of CR strategies, choices of CR strategies by genders and choices of CR strategies under different contextual factors like relative social power or social distance between the speaker and the hearer. The findings show that CR strategies by Chinese college students have changed a lot and are much different with the traditional patterns: (1) Chinese college students prefer Acceptance strategy to Rejection strategy, and Implicit Acceptance strategy is the first choice. (2) The females have greater tendency to use <b>Explicit</b> <b>Acceptance</b> strategy than the males; whereas the males prefer to use Deflection and Rejection strategies.

However, this phenomenon is relatively uncommon and has a limited potential. One of the options that focuses on increasing organ donation is to admit patients with catastrophic brain injuries (with a high probability of brain death and nontreatable) to the Intensive Care Unit, with the only purpose of donation.

40|$|The thesis revives the {{historical}} {{importance of a}} small, relatively obscure Australian workfare policy through a marxist theoretical framework that is equally marginal to Australian social policy analytics. The Jobs, Education and Training Program (JET) was a first-wave Active Society social welfare policy introduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1989. JET holds the peculiar {{distinction of being the}} only voluntary mass workfare program in Australian history. JET not only affected the lives of close to one million people, mainly single mothers and their children, but {{played a key role in}} fundamentally restructuring Australian welfare production. During the late 1990 s state managers saw in the emotional and affective labour of JET workers an institutional opportunity to reconfigure frontline welfare labour processes into the neoliberal, ‘customer service’ model now adopted by Centrelink. How did JET, ‘the best social justice policy Social Security ever had’ turn into a compulsory mass workfare template for current state social reproduction policy? This first historical appraisal of JET adopts what Perry Anderson has termed marxism’s ‘classical tradition’ to ask: how might a marxist analysis of the Jobs, Education and Training program (1989 - 2006) explain its character and demise in the context of an historical critique of the Australian &# 039;welfare reform agenda&# 039;? State social reproduction relations in economically advanced countries have become a crucial and growing aspect of the accumulation dynamics of national capitals. The thesis aligns with the progressive intent of those who argue that top-down and bottom-up policy implementation is in political tension, but replaces Lipsky’s liberal rendering of this tension with an historical materialist critique of policy production. In the interviews of JET workers and policy managers conducted for this research, a capacity to elicit the material and social underpinnings from what is being said comes through a particular application of the theoretical insights offered by the Bakhtin circle and Marx’s critique of capitalist ideology. With the more <b>explicit</b> ideological <b>acceptance</b> of neoliberalism in the 1990 s, welfare policies and state organisations were structured to more openly meet the social reproduction strategies of the period. The ‘strenuous welfarism’ of compulsory workfare for the majority of welfare recipients on one side of the Centrelink counter had its corollary on the other. The emotional and affective labour-readying work, once only conducted by JET Advisers, was added to the technical payment process activities of Centrelink frontline staff. The broadening of workfare reduced and generalised this work into a labour-forcing process. Three political conclusions are drawn. Firstly, that workfare and industrial relations policies are connected aspects of a neoliberal ideology which principally aims to increase capital accumulation. Secondly, effective opposition to workfare needs to rid itself of the debilitating assumption that these are welfare arrangements rather than primarily programs designed to produce consumable labour power for capital. Thirdly, that only by reinvigorating the social and labour movements will such an effective opposition emerge capable of challenging the welfare and industrial straightjackets neoliberalism is currently imposing...|$|R
40|$|To ensure both {{long-term}} {{persistence and}} evolutionary potential, the required {{number of individuals}} in a population often greatly exceeds the targets proposed by conservation management.

The evidence is clear, yet conservation policy does not appear to reflect these findings, with pragmatic concerns on feasibility over-riding biological risk assessment. As such, we argue that conservation biology faces a dilemma akin to those working on the physical basis of climate change, where scientific recommendations on carbon emission reductions are compromised by policy makers.
