5|$|Much {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> {{applications of}} photons {{in the field}} of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, THSRC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> the {{preservation}} of the pheasant-tailed jacana, a type of bird that is considered endangered in Taiwan. With NT$50 million invested, the first artificial habitat recovery project was completed in collaboration with the local government, country development organizations and non-profit organizations. The pheasant-tailed jacana population in Tainan, Taiwan, which at one point numbered less than 50, has increased to over 300. In 2007, the recovery habitat was officially renamed “Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park” and since then, it has opened to the public. To educate students in matters concerning environmental protection, every year THSRC arranges for elementary and junior high school students to visit Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park(台南官田—水雉生態教育園區), where they are able to learn about the beauty of Taiwan’s natural habitats.|$|E

25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb is a laser source whose spectrum {{consists of a}} series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L.

25|$|Some {{but not all}} {{polynomial}} equations with rational coefficients have {{a solution}} that is an algebraic expression with {{a finite number of}} operations involving just those coefficients (that is, it can be solved algebraically).

A large amount of research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations).|$|E
25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> {{the search for a}} `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E

25|$|Will Mulcaster {{argued that}} while much {{research}} and creative thought <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> generating alternative strategies, too little {{work has been}} done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect {{it can be seen that}} the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, the French scholar Joseph de Guignes {{became the}} first to propose {{a link between the}} Huns and the Xiongnu people, who were {{northern}} neighbours of China in the 3rd century BC. Since Guignes' time, considerable scholarly effort <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> investigating such a connection. However, there is no scholarly consensus on a direct connection between the dominant element of the Xiongnu and that of the Huns. Priscus, a 5th-century Roman diplomat and Greek historian, mentions that the Huns had a language of their own; little of it has survived and its relationships have mainly been considered the Turkic or Mongolic languages. Numerous other ethnic groups were included under Attila the Hun's rule, including very many speakers of Gothic, which some modern scholars describe as a lingua franca of the Empire. Their main military technique was mounted archery.|$|E

The accuracy and effectiveness with which this is done rests on, (1) the principles involved, and (2) the methods used.|$|E
