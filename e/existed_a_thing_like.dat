60|$|COKESON. Dear! Oh dear! I {{never came}} across <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. It unsettles you. All goes on regular, {{and then}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this happens. Shan't relish my lunch to-day.|$|R
60|$|BURLACOMBE. 'Tes a bit immoral-like to {{pass over}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that. Tes funny if women's gain's on's to be encouraged.|$|R
5000|$|... "Oh no, my men wouldn't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] - his {{pro forma}} denial of any {{accusation}} against his men.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. [Disguising {{her grief}} at once.] I simply can't imagine what Roper means {{by making a}} joke of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that! ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. It's {{a matter}} of form; but I can't stand upon niceness over <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this--too serious. Just talk to Mr. Cowley.|$|R
60|$|BERT (stoutly). I don't see that, Mr. Pindar. Every man, {{no matter}} who he is, has to decide <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this for himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Jimmy. It hurts. Everything's so changed. I'm miserable. You wouldn't {{have said}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> {{that in the}} old days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] Fred cried, while Sam {{stood near}} the desk pale as death, but every action {{breathing}} defiance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sakes alive!" [...] {{the woman}} muttered, {{as she looked}} down. [...] "What does he carry <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that for--in <b>a</b> {{peaceful}} country, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{went on as}} if to himself, without {{apparently}} heeding her: [...] "There's {{only one}} way of proving one's faith in <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS [indignantly] Well, {{of all the}} mean--[words fail him]! I'd {{let myself}} be shot sooner than do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that. I {{consider}} youve stolen that drawing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Such magnanimity Is now not needed, sir; for {{you will}} see That since I am here, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this is, plainly, [...] Best done by me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Speaker (laughing). [...] "Tut, tut, {{never mind}} <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that. I {{am sure that}} after all that we have gone through together, the House is quite agreed that <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> {{parliamentary}} procedure doesn't matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? What {{on earth}} was your object--YOU to do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that!" [...] Mortimer pointed reproachfully {{at the plate}} which lay before him on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "How brutal of the friend!" [...] {{the girl}} observed. [...] "He might have {{let him down}} gently. You wouldn't do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that, would you, Mr. Pratt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{knowing how}} {{that might have}} been. I never {{calculated}} those chances. When a man wants to do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that he generally does it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, there isn't, aunt Dorcas. I {{said over}} the words jest as they was printed, 'cause I'd be sure to {{remember}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] Joe replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Married? I {{never thought}} of that. But no, I guess he's not. He'd have {{mentioned}} it. He's not the sort to hush up <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that. I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the answer, [...] "only {{with a fair}} wind. You can't beat <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that to windward. There's {{not enough}} {{of her in the}} water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say! You, who {{are up to}} {{fighting}} a man with your bare hands, could you--eh?--could you manage to stick one with <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that knife of mine?" ...|$|R
60|$|COKESON. Sit down, won't you? I'm not a {{sensitive}} man, but <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> {{this about the}} place--it's not nice. I like people to be open and jolly together.|$|R
60|$|FALDER. When I found I'd done <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that, {{to do it}} {{for nothing}} seemed so dreadful. I might just as well have chucked myself into the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am," [...] replied Peter. He {{knew that}} {{not one of the}} meadow and forest people who were always trying to catch him would do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one {{branch of}} your {{education}} that I {{should like to}} undertake if I ever saw you at <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that again. Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I have {{a notion}} {{you will have}} {{something}} to hear. I dare say you have some idea. Catch a young lady not up to <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{she is just}} as headstrong and as silly, when {{it comes}} to <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this. Our only hope is to let her have her own way." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. [Moving {{with his}} chair, and {{stopping}} with a smile.] If you ask me, I should say it wasn't {{playing the game}} to put Molly into <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> it," [...] said the chief. [...] "It is neither Waz-don nor Ho-don. I wonder from whence it came {{and what it is}} called." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Over! What a {{word that}} is! <b>A</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that is over, {{and then all the}} world cannot put it back again. What if he should be unhappy after all?" ...|$|R
50|$|Miranda: Why that's <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man (for aught I know) {{with a great}} pair of horns {{upon his}} head, and my father said 'twas made for women, look ye.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{think so}} yourself," [...] said Meta. [...] "Nobody else {{can give a}} judgment. In <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this, asking is, what you once called, seeking {{opinions}} as Balaam inquired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{could do}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that, I'd die happy!" [...] she exclaimed impetuously, as {{a feeling of}} despair came over her {{at the thought of}} her own poor attempts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid you}} will have to wait a little while, and explain the whole affair to the judge in the morning. I haven't any {{authority}} to do <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|WANKLIN. Cowardice is an {{unpleasant}} word, Mr. Edgar Anthony. It will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the men's demands when <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this happens; {{we must be}} careful! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} have, Norman. I spoke hastily, my boy--you will not think more of it. When <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> this comes on a man, he hardly knows what he says." ...|$|R
