5|$|It’s {{a deadly}} time {{in so many}} ways to be in a band; you can <b>have</b> <b>so</b> much control over your work if you’re clever; you can release it how and when you like and in our opinion, right now, Ireland is the healthiest it’s ever been in terms of talent and diversity.|$|E
60|$|Lydgate {{started up}} from his chair and went towards the window, forgetting where he was. He <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often gone over in his mind the {{possibility}} of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often decided against it--he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often said to himself that his assertions would not change people's impressions--that Dorothea's words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable.|$|R

5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far not been proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania. It shows the least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters {{range from a}} few kilometers {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo. All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks, but no crater has rays.|$|E

5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels.

5|$|The Gathering Storm was {{released}} on October 27, 2009, with an initial print run of one million books. Sanderson supported the release with a 25 city book signing tour, with McDougal attending some events. The first event in the tour was a midnight release party in Provo, Utah with several hundred fans of the series attending. An unabridged audiobook {{was released}}, produced and read by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer, who <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far produced all the audiobooks for the series.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons are at Springfield War Memorial Stadium {{watching}} the Springfield Isotopes baseball game. After the first pitch, Homer becomes {{disappointed by the}} poor performance of the Isotopes and waits in the car. Six months later, he enters Moe's Tavern and is informed by Lenny and Carl that the Isotopes are in the playoffs, and <b>have,</b> <b>so</b> far, been playing well. Homer quickly joins in with the fans to support the Isotopes, who end up winning the pennant. To celebrate, Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney go on a drunken binge and accidentally vandalize Springfield Elementary School.|$|E

5|$|The crust-like genera Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma, {{formerly}} {{placed in}} the Corticiaceae or Gloeocystidiellaceae, are now classified in the Russulaceae and basal to the clade of mushroom-forming species described above. Studies <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far failed to clearly circumscribe and place these genera within the family. Boidinia in its current extent is polyphyletic, with some species not falling into the Russulaceae.|$|E

The public is invited to come examine in the establishment some portraits obtained by the new process.|$|E
5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on {{a place for the}} premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to <b>have</b> <b>so</b> complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could take place at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

5|$|Ankylosaurus {{existed between}} 68 and 66 million years ago, in the final, or Maastrichtian, {{stage of the}} Late Cretaceous Period. It was among the last dinosaur genera that {{appeared}} before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens {{have been found in}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming and the Scollard Formation in Alberta, Canada, all of which date {{to the end of the}} Cretaceous. Fossils of Ankylosaurus are rare in these sediments, and the distribution of its remains suggest that it was restricted to the uplands of the formations, rather than the coastal lowlands. Another ankylosaur, an indeterminate nodosaur (formerly referred to as Edmontonia sp.), is also found in the same formations, but the range of the two genera does not seem to have overlapped. Their remains <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far not been found in the same localities, and the nodosaur appears to have inhabited the lowlands. The narrower muzzle of the nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than Ankylosaurus, further indicating ecological separation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to {{supplement}} the Di 3. In 1992, {{the decision was made}} to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|E
