40|$|Beryllium is a {{naturally}} occurring element with many unique properties {{and a variety}} of uses. When combined with other elements, such as copper, specialized alloys may be made that are of particular value for certain applications. In the electrical industry copper beryllium alloys are frequently present in electrical components in the contactors, relays, springs and other metallic components. Though beryllium has many excellent physical properties and poses minimal to no human health hazard when in a solid finished form, inhaling the dust or fumes of beryllium containing materials can cause serious health issues. This project assesses whether removable beryllium surface contamination is present on four different types of <b>electrical</b> <b>switchgear</b> <b>equipment.</b> A total of 119 wipe samples were collected from four different styles of electrical switchgear. All wipe sample results were well below the established criteria of 0. 2 μg/ 100 cm 2. Equipment sampled and results in μg/ 100 cm 2 included Siemen Allis Contactors (CI 95 % 0. 019, 0. 029), Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers (CI 95 % 0. 014, 0. 019), Westinghouse Air Circuit Breaker (CI 95 % - 0. 009, 0. 047), and GE Power Vacuum Breaker (CI 95 % 0. 02). In addition, 6 bulk samples were collected from 6 Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers with all results below the criteria established of 2 μg/g, (CI 95 % 0. 21, 0. 46). Extensive surface beryllium contamination {{does not appear to be}} a credible concern for the pieces of electrical switchgear sampled...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{some of the}} key {{problems in}} reducing lead times for engineered-toorder construction products, specifically items of <b>equipment</b> such as <b>electrical</b> <b>switchgear</b> (“permanent plant <b>equipment</b> ” in the jargon of the process industries). Lead time reduction has long been considered a fundamental objective in overall business improvement and is a cornerstone in lean thinking. The benefits include reduced inventories and costs, greater flexibility and responsiveness, and better satisfied customers. In construction projects, shorter lead times could significantly reduce the number of change orders and/or make projects more robust to changes. The authors suggest that the focus on reducing engineering lead times will have a greater impact on lead time reduction than a further focus on the manufacturing stage and that the product specification stage may play a more significant role in lead time reduction. An example of a switchgear supply chain demonstrates how long lead times lead to inadequate information from various players in the product specification stage impairs the process and leads to a chain reaction further down the supply chain. As a result, numerous design iterations and change orders occur, which further propagate the long lead times. This pernicious system dynamic is further {{complicated by the fact that}} some players in the switchgear supply chain profit from (or believe they profit from) change orders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To find {{feasible}} {{alternatives to}} the use of SF 6 in medium voltage <b>switchgear</b> <b>equipment,</b> AREVA T&D and Tsinghua University has started a cooperation to investigate the feasibility of using vacuum. This paper focused on three main points of the design of the Vacuum Insulated Switchgear (VIS) : the maintainability of vacuum system, the insulation performance, and the thermal behavior under operating conditions. In our work, such steps were followed: literature review, basic designs, calculation and analysis. The investigation results showed the feasibility of 40. 5 kV/ 2 kA VIS, assuming that the thermal design and material choice are done carefully in order to fulfill the requirements: insulation rating, life time and rated current. Whereas, for High Voltage <b>switchgear</b> <b>equipment,</b> 126 kV or higher voltage level, further experimental research work is still needed.
