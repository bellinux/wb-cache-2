40|$|PURPOSE: Somatostatin-based radiopeptide {{treatment}} is generally performed using the β-emitting radionuclides (90) Y or (177) Lu. The present study aimed at comparing {{benefits and harms of}} both therapeutic approaches. METHODS: In a comparative cohort study, patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours underwent repeated cycles of [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC or [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC until progression of disease or permanent adverse events. Multivariable Cox regression and competing risks regression {{were employed to}} examine predictors of survival and adverse events for both treatment groups. RESULTS: Overall, 910 patients underwent 1, 804  cycles of [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC and 141 patients underwent 259  cycles of [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC. The median survival after [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC and after [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC was comparable (45. 5  months versus 35. 9  months, hazard ratio 0. 91, 95  % confidence interval 0. 63 - 1. 30, p[*]=[*] 0. 49). Subgroup analyses revealed a significantly longer survival for [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC over [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC in patients with low tumour uptake, solitary lesions and extra-hepatic lesions. The rate of severe transient <b>haematotoxicities</b> was lower after [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC treatment (1. 4 vs 10. 1  %, p[*]=[*] 0. 001), while the rate of severe permanent renal toxicities was similar in both treatment groups (9. 2 vs 7. 8  %, p[*]=[*] 0. 32). CONCLUSION: The present results revealed no difference in median overall survival after [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC and [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC. Furthermore, [(177) Lu-DOTA]-TOC was less haematotoxic than [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin ± gemcitabine in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) pretreated with pemetrexed. Methods The study enrolled consecutive patients with relapsed MPM, all of them pretreated with a platin-pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin 80 mg/m 2 was administered as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 given on day 1 and 8. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. The primary endpoints were response rate and disease control rate. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to tumour progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), and toxicity. Results Between February 2005 and September 2007 29 patients (median age: 65. 0 years, World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status: 0 – 3) were enrolled. The follow-up period encompassed 5. 4 to 97. 4 weeks (median: 24. 3 weeks). Out of these 29 patients, 15 were treated in second, 10 in third, 3 in fourth and 1 in fifth line, respectively. The majority of the patients received the combination oxaliplatin and gemcitabine (n = 25 vs. 4; 86. 2 vs. 13. 8 %). The median overall survival (OS) was 71. 7 weeks (30. 6 – 243. 3 weeks), whereas survival from the start of oxaliplatin/gemcitabine-treatment was 24. 3 weeks (5. 4 – 97. 3 weeks). Median time to tumour progression (TTP) was 9. 3 weeks (3. 0 – 67. 6 weeks). Partial response (PR) was observed in 2 patients (6. 9 %), stable disease (SD) for at least three courses of treatment in 11 patients (37. 9 %). Thus, disease control rate was 44. 8 %, whereas 16 of 29 patients exhibited progressive disease (55. 2 %). The toxicity profile was favourable, with no WHO grade 4 -toxicities, only few dose-reductions were performed due to non-symptomatic <b>haematotoxicities</b> (neutropenia, thrombopenia). Mild WHO grade 2 neurotoxicity was seen in 6 patients. Conclusion Pemetrexed-pretreated patients with progressive MPM may benefit from a consecutive chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine without significant toxicity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Dose {{limiting}} <b>haematotoxicity</b> {{has been}} associated with a range of therapeutic agents used for the treatment of a number of different conditions. <b>Haematotoxicity</b> is usually assessed as part of the preclinical safety studies in experimental animals, where changes in peripheral blood cell numbers and bone marrow cellularity are determined {{at the end of the}} study. Often no information on the mechanism of the <b>haematotoxicity</b> is revealed. This thesis demonstrates how in vitro bone marrow cultures can be utilized to assist in the assessment of <b>haematotoxicity</b> by two different approaches; firstly, in vitro bone marrow cultures can be used to assess the haematopoietic lineage specificity of vincristine sulphate, vinblastine sulphate, hydroxyurea and anagrelide hydrochloride using clonogenic cultures, enabling ranking of these compounds according to their <b>haematotoxicity.</b> Secondly, using in vitro assays only, elucidate the mechanism(s) of the megakaryocytic lineage specific inhibition of anagrelide hydrochloride. To this end both clonogenic cultures and LTBMC offer the ability to elucidate mechanisms of action on multipotent stem cells, lineage specific cells and effects on the bone marrow microenvironment following single and repeated administration. In addition, the combination of cell identification techniques flow cytometry and light microscopy was shown to provide a more detailed understanding of the different cell populations within the non-adherent cell layer. In vivo AN reduces platelet counts only, however, the mechanism of the megakaryocyte specific toxicity by AN is not understood. In these studies, the mechanism (s) of the megakaryocytic lineage <b>haematotoxicity</b> of AN was examined using the established human clonogenic and LTBMC. The action of AN was shown to be focused at a late stage in megakaryocyte (Mk) colony development. Ranking the potential mechanisms of action of AN by concentration at which they were noted, the inability to organize the microtubules appears to be secondary to 1) alteration in cell cycling, 2) surface receptor expression and 3) inhibition in achieving high (greater than 8 N) ploidy number. However, identification of the primary mechanism based solely on concentration seems to be very crude and most probably reflects a limitation of in vitro systems. The inhibition of platelet production by AN is most likely a result from a combination of mechanisms; inhibition of cell cycling, disruption in the expression of cell surface receptors, inhibition of the ability of the cells to increase ploidy number and an associated inability to organize microtubules leading to a reduction in platelet release. This work also demonstrated the importance of the selection of the source of bone marrow used in the cultures. The concentration at which 50 percent of Mk colony growth was inhibited (IC 50) by AN for murine cells was markedly (46 fold) different (88. 6 ??M) compared to the IC 50 with human cord blood (hCB) (1. 92 ??M). This disparity is indicative of differences in species sensitivity possibly related to AN having a greater affinity towards the human c-mpl chrombopoietin (TPO) receptor than the equivalent murine receptor as suggested by McCarty et al (2006). This work highlights the utility of in vitro bone marrow cultures as a tool for investigating the lineage specific <b>haematotoxicity</b> by evaluating compounds used in the treatment of ET. In addition in vitro haematopoietic cultures can successfully be used as a tool to investigate potential mechanism(s) of <b>haematotoxicity</b> as demonstrated herein by providing an insight to mechanism of platelet count reduction by AN...|$|E

Exposure of rats to paracetamol caused changes of some haematological parameters (RBCs count, Hb concentration, Ht value and WBCs count), suggesting that the paracetamol induced <b>haematotoxicity.</b> Paracetamol reduced serum total protein (TP), albumin and globulin, while increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities compared to the control. The results indicate that paracetamol is led to significant decrease in the concentration of Na+ and K+ and increase of Ca 2 + in the serum compared to the control.

40|$|Summary. Different {{health risks}} {{including}} <b>haematotoxicity</b> {{and weight loss}} have been reported for gasoline. Supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E {{has been shown to}} ameliorate the toxicity effects of gasoline vapours exposure. Honey contains vitamins, and polyphenols that possess good antioxidant properties. The potential role of honey in preventing gasoline-induced <b>haematotoxicity</b> and weight loss was assessed in male rats. The rats were exposed to gasoline (11. 13 ± 1. 1 cm 3 /h) 6 hours/day, 6 days/week, for 11 weeks. Honey (1. 2 g/kg body weight/day) was administered for 11 weeks in one group and for 2 weeks in another group. The percentage weight gain and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly reduced in the gasoline exposed rats. On the other hand, the percentage of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow was higher in the gasoline exposed group. These findings suggest that gasoline vapours inhalation was associated with adverse alteration in weight, haematological indices, and bone marrow megakaryocytes of male rats. Administration of honey, did not improve the weight changes associated with gasoline exposure; it however improved the MCHC values and reduced the percentage of abnormal megakaryocytes. Industrial relevance. Honey is one of the famous natural products recognized for its enriched antioxidants composition which contribute significantly to its therapeutic effect in a number of diseases.

40|$|Background: <b>Haematotoxicity</b> of {{conventional}} chemotherapies {{often results in}} delays of treatment or reduction of chemotherapy dose. To ameliorate these side-effects, patients are routinely treated with blood transfusions or haematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin (EPO) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). For the latter ones, pharmaceutical derivatives are available, which differ in absorption kinetics, pharmacokinetic and -dynamic properties. Due to the complex interaction of cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and the stimulating effects of different growth factor derivatives, optimal treatment is a non-trivial task. In the past, we developed mathematical models of thrombopoiesis, granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis under chemotherapy and growth-factor applications {{which can be used}} to perform clinically relevant predictions regarding the feasibility of chemotherapy schedules and cytopenia prophylaxis with haematopoietic growth factors. However, interactions of lineages and growth-factors were ignored so far. Results: To close this gap, we constructed a hybrid model of human granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis under conventional chemotherapy, G-CSF and EPO applications. This was achieved by combining our single lineage models of human erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis with a common stem cell model. G-CSF effects on erythropoiesis were also implemented. Pharmacodynamic models are based on ordinary differential equations describing proliferation and maturation of haematopoietic cells. The system is regulated by feedback loops partly mediated by endogenous and exogenous EPO and G-CSF. Chemotherapy is modelled by depletion of cells. Unknown model parameters were determined by fitting the model predictions to time series data of blood counts and cytokine profiles. Data were extracted from literature or received from cooperating clinical study groups. Our model explains dynamics of mature blood cells and cytokines after growth-factor applications in healthy volunteers. Moreover, we modelled 15 different chemotherapeutic drugs by estimating their bone marrow toxicity. Taking into account different growth-factor schedules, this adds up to 33 different chemotherapy regimens explained by the model. Conclusions: We conclude that we established a comprehensive biomathematical model to explain the dynamics of granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis under combined chemotherapy, G-CSF, and EPO applications. We demonstrate how {{it can be used to}} make predictions regarding <b>haematotoxicity</b> of yet untested chemotherapy and growth-factor schedules...|$|E

METHODS: To further examine if genetic variation contributes to benzene <b>haematotoxicity,</b> we analysed 1023 tagSNPs in 121 gene regions important for benzene metabolism, haematopoiesis, leukaemia and lymphoma among 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 unexposed controls in a cross-sectional study {{carried out in}} China. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and total white blood cell (WBC) count and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders and occupational exposure to benzene and toluene among exposed workers. The minp test assessed the association on the gene region level. The false discovery rate method was used to control for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: VEGF (minp = 0. 0030) and ERCC 3 (minp = 0. 0042) were the most significantly associated gene regions with altered WBC counts among benzene-exposed workers, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD 4 + T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC 3. Further, in workers exposed t...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethroids, commercially {{available}} pesticides, are greatly in use these days, and thus they carry considerable chances of contaminating various ecosystems. <b>Haematotoxicity</b> of cypermethrin, a broadly used type II pyrethroid, has been assessed {{in the present}} study. Selected parameters included determination of total RBC count, haemoglobin concentration (Hb conc.), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), {{mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration}} (MCHC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (DLC), along with qualitative analysis of blood and bone marrow. Of these parameters, those showing significant decline following cypermethrin intoxication included total RBC count, Hb conc., PCV, MCV, MCH, whereas non-significant decrease was observed in the case of MCHC. ESR, TLC and DLC, on the other hand, increased significantly following cypermethrin intoxication. Qualitative changes included altered red cell morphology such as microcystosis, appearance of stomatocytes, poikilocytosis, giant platelet formation, etc. in peripheral blood and increased erythroid precursors in bone marrow of treated rats. These parameters were however normalised following twenty-two days of recovery phas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Flavonoids {{and various}} {{phenolics}} {{are the most}} important pharmacologically active constituents in propolis capable of scavenging free radicals. The present work aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} aqueous extract of Libyan propolis as a natural source of antioxidants to minimize the harmful effects of sodium nitrite induced <b>haematotoxicity</b> and hyperlipidemia in Guinea pigs. In this study, Twenty four adult male Guinea pigs were used for this study and divided into four groups. The first group was control group, the 2 nd was the propolis group orally received propolis (200 mg/kg body wt), the 3 rd was the experimental and received sodium nitrite orally at a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight, the 4 th one co-administered sodium nitrite orally at a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight with propolis (200 mg/kg body wt) daily for 35 days. Blood samples were obtained for assessment of haematological parameters and serum lipids profile. In sodium nitrite treated animals, there were severe haematological changes and dyslipidemia.

40|$|Oxaliplatin, a new third-generation {{platinum}} complex, {{is active}} {{in the treatment of}} colorectal and advanced ovarian cancers, both as monotherapy and in combination therapy. It has demonstrated a very good safety profile, characterized by low <b>haematotoxicity,</b> and moderate and manageable gastrointestinal toxicity. No significant renal or ototoxicities have been observed. Oxaliplatin induces a peripheral sensory neuropathy which is characterized by distal and perioral dysaesthesia, and is induced or exacerbated by the cold; in general, it is regressive between cycles of treatment. This dose-limiting toxicity is cumulative, but reversible within a few months of discontinuation of treatment in the majority of cases. In a cohort study of 490 patients with advanced colorectal cancer included in an extended access programme, more than 2700 cycles of oxaliplatin plus 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) were administered. The overall safety profile of oxaliplatin was shown to be very favourable. Oxaliplatin and cisplatin, each in combination with cyclophosphamide, have a similar efficacy in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, but oxaliplatin was better tolerated than cisplatin in terms of haematological, gastrointestinal, neurosensory and renal toxicities. The safety profile of oxaliplatin makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapy...|$|E

Using an in vivo-in vitro tumour-excision assay, the administration of MISO simultaneously with or 3 h after low doses of BCNU (less than 20 mg/kg) was found to give a dose-modification factor (DMF) of approximately 1. 65 relative to BCNU alone. At higher doses of BCNU, there was less enhancement of cell kill. The DMF for tumour growth delay was likewise dependent on BCNU dose, continuously decreasing with increasing BCNU dose. In contrast, the anti-tumour activity of CHLZ, assessed by both clonogenic cell survival and tumour-growth delay, was not significantly enhanced {{by the addition of}} MISO. The enhancement of gastrointestinal toxicity and <b>haematotoxicity</b> by BCNU-MISO combinations was assessed by LD 50 / 7 and CFU-S assays, respectively.

40|$|Val{{ganciclovir}} and ganciclovir {{are widely}} used {{for the prevention of}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant recipients, with a major impact on patients' morbidity and mortality. Oral valganciclovir, the ester prodrug of ganciclovir, has been developed to enhance the oral bioavailability of ganciclovir. It crosses the gastrointestinal barrier through peptide transporters and is then hydrolysed into ganciclovir. This review aims to describe the current knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of this agent, and {{to address the issue of}} therapeutic drug monitoring. Based on currently available literature, ganciclovir pharmacokinetics in adult solid organ transplant recipients receiving oral valganciclovir are characterized by bioavailability of 66 +/- 10 % (mean +/- SD), a maximum plasma concentration of 3. 1 +/- 0. 8 mg/L after a dose of 450 mg and of 6. 6 +/- 1. 9 mg/L after a dose of 900 mg, a time to reach the maximum plasma concentration of 3. 0 +/- 1. 0 hours, area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of 29. 1 +/- 5. 3 mg. h/L and 51. 9 +/- 18. 3 mg. h/L (after 450 mg and 900 mg, respectively), apparent clearance of 12. 4 +/- 3. 8 L/h, an elimination half-life of 5. 3 +/- 1. 5 hours and an apparent terminal volume of distribution of 101 +/- 36 L. The apparent clearance is highly correlated with renal function, hence the dosage needs to be adjusted in proportion to the glomerular filtration rate. Unexplained interpatient variability is limited (18 % in apparent clearance and 28 % in the apparent central volume of distribution). There is no indication of erratic or limited absorption in given subgroups of patients; however, this may be of concern in patients with severe malabsorption. The in vitro pharmacodynamics of ganciclovir reveal a mean concentration producing 50 % inhibition (IC(50)) among CMV clinical strains of 0. 7 mg/L (range 0. 2 - 1. 9 mg/L). Systemic exposure of ganciclovir appears to be moderately correlated with clinical antiviral activity and <b>haematotoxicity</b> during CMV prophylaxis in high-risk transplant recipients. Low ganciclovir plasma concentrations have been associated with treatment failure and high concentrations with <b>haematotoxicity</b> and neurotoxicity, but no formal therapeutic or toxic ranges have been validated. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ganciclovir after valganciclovir administration (bioavailability, apparent clearance and volume of distribution) are fairly predictable in adult transplant patients, with little interpatient variability beyond the effect of renal function and bodyweight. Thus ganciclovir exposure can probably be controlled with sufficient accuracy by thorough valganciclovir dosage adjustment according to patient characteristics. In addition, the therapeutic margin of ganciclovir is loosely defined. The usefulness of systematic therapeutic drug monitoring in adult transplant patients therefore appears questionable; however, studies are still needed to extend knowledge to particular subgroups of patients or dosage regimens...|$|E
40|$|Megakaryocytopoiesis {{gives rise}} to {{platelets}} by proliferation and differentiation of lineage-specific progenitors, identified in vitro as Colony Forming Unit-Megakaryocytes (CFU-Mk). The {{aim of this study}} was to refine and optimize the in vitro Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the CFU-Mk assay for detecting drug-induced thrombocytopenia and to prevalidate a model for predicting the acute exposure levels that cause maximum tolerated decreases in the platelets count, based on the correlation with the maximal plasma concentrations (C max) in vivo. The assay was linear under the SOP conditions, and the in vitro endpoints (percentage of colonies growing) were reproducible within and across laboratories. The protocol performance phase was carried out testing 10 drugs (selected on the base of their recognised or potential in vivo <b>haematotoxicity,</b> according to the literature). Results showed that a relationship can be established between the maximal concentration in plasma (C max) and the in vitro concentrations that inhibited the 10 - 50 - 90 percent of colonies growth (ICs). When C max is lower than IC 10, it is possible to predict that the chemicals have no direct toxicity effect on CFU-Mk and could not induce thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow damage. When the C max is higher than IC 90 and/or IC 50, thrombocytopenia can occur due to direct toxicity of chemicals on CFU-Mk progenitors. JRC. DDG. I. 4 -Molecular biology and genomic...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A phase I {{multicentre}} trial {{was conducted to}} define the recommended dose of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin and irinotecan (OCX) in metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with performance status (PS) < 2 and adequate haematological, renal and liver function received oxaliplatin 70 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15, irinotecan 100 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 22 and one of five dose levels (DL 1 - 5, between 800 and 1, 600 mg/ m(2)) of capecitabine on days 1 - 29 every 5 weeks. RESULTS: 23 patients received a median of 3 cycles. 3 dose-limiting toxicities occurred (DL 1 : grade 3 (G 3) elevated alkaline phosphatase; DL 5 : 1 patient G 4 hyperglycaemia/G 3 diarrhoea and 1 sudden death). The most common severe adverse event was G 3 diarrhoea (13 %). Severe <b>haematotoxicity</b> was rare. Therapy was stopped mainly due to metastasectomy or tumour progression (7 patients each). 8 patients reached a partial response. Median time to progression and overall survival (OS) were 8. 0 and 21. 9 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended capecitabine dose in this schedule is 1, 400 mg/m(2) daily. The OCX regimen is well tolerated. The response rate was surprisingly low with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS {{within the range of}} a triple combination.

Patients with no prior treatment and oesophageal cancer stage I to III, performance status 1500 [*]kcal[*]day− 1 were included. Chemotherapy, with cisplatin 30 [*]mg[*]m− 2 and irinotecan 60 [*]mg[*]m− 2, was administered at days 1, 8, 22, 29, and concurrently with radiotherapy at days 43, 50, 64 and 71. Radiotherapy was delivered with 50 or 50. 4 [*]Gy in 25 fractions/ 5 weeks. Forty-three patients were included, 10 stage I, 19 stage II and 14 stage III. Mean age was 59. 2 years (range 44 – 79). A total of 30 out of 43 (69. 8 %) patients underwent all planned treatment. During induction chemotherapy, 14 severe toxicities of grade 3 or 4 in 10 patients (23. 3 %) were reported with 57. 1 % due to haematoxicity. During chemoradiotherapy, 31 severe toxicities of grade 3 or 4 with 64. 5 % due to <b>haematotoxicity</b> were reported in 18 patients. One toxic death occurred (diarrhoea grade 4). The complete clinical response rate was 58. 1 % (95 % CI: 43. 4 – 72. 8 %).
