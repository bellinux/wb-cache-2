Energy inputs {{were calculated for}} grain corn production with data from field experiments utilizing inorganic fertilizer and liquid swine manure as sources of plant nutrients. The calculations utilized energy coefficients taken from the literature and actual application rates of the various input products including seed corn, starter fertilizer and regular <b>inorganic</b> fertilizer, <b>herbicides,</b> fuel for field operations, and grain drying. The results showed that grain corn could be produced successfully by substituting manure for inorganic fertilizer. The energy savings in the manured treatments resulted largely from eliminating the energy in fertilizer manufacture and ranged from 31 to 34 % of the energy input for inorganic fertilizer based grain corn production. Published agricultural statistics were used to extrapolate the results to the entire Mixedwood Plains Ecozone which covers the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Valley regions of Ontario and Quebec. An estimated upper bound of 4. 6 PJ (1 petajoule = 1015 joules) of energy could be saved annually by substituting livestock manure for inorganic fertilizer {{in the production of}} the entire acreage of grain corn grown in the ecozone.

40|$|The {{water utility}} sector {{is subject to}} {{stringent}} legislation, seeking to address both the evolution of practices within the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, and the safeguarding of environmental protection, and which is informed by stakeholder views. Growing public environmental awareness is balanced by fair apportionment of liability within-sector. This highly complex and dynamic context poses challenges for water utilities seeking to manage the diverse chemicals arising from disparate sources reaching Wastewater Treatment Plants, including residential, commercial, and industrial points of origin, and diffuse sources including agricultural and hard surface water run-off. Effluents contain broad ranges of organic and <b>inorganic</b> compounds, <b>herbicides,</b> pesticides, phosphorus, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals of emerging concern. These potential pollutants can be in dissolved form, or arise in association with organic matter, the associated risks posing significant environmental challenges. This paper examines how the adoption of new Big Data tools and computational technologies can offer great advantage to the water utility sector in addressing this challenge. Big Data approaches facilitate improved understanding and insight of these challenges, by industry, regulator, and public alike. We discuss how Big Data approaches {{can be used to}} improve the outputs of tools currently in use by the water industry, such as SAGIS (Source Apportionment GIS system), helping to reveal new relationships between chemicals, the environment, and human health, and in turn provide better understanding of contaminants in wastewater (origin, pathways, and persistence). We highlight how the sector can draw upon Big Data tools to add value to legacy datasets, such as the Chemicals Investigation Programme in the UK, combined with contemporary data sources, extending the lifespan of data, focusing monitoring strategies, and helping users adapt and plan more efficiently. Despite the relative maturity of the Big Data technology and adoption in many wider sectors, uptake within the water utility sector remains limited to date. By contrast with the extensive range of applications of Big Data in in other sectors, highlight is drawn to how improvements are required to achieve the full potential of this technology in the water utility industry...|$|R

40|$|N-Tox® {{is a new}} {{technique}} for evaluating the nitrification efficiency in industrial or municipal activated sludge systems, using direct measurement of nitrous oxide (N 20) {{as an indicator of}} nitrification failure. Research using pilot-scale activated sludge plants treating real settled wastewater has demonstrated that detection of increased N 2 O concentration in the aeration tanks by N-Tox® is able to provide early warning of nitrification failure. The N-Tox® monitor relies on non-invasive gas-phase detection which avoids sampling of activated sludge and eliminates associated probe fouling problems and maintenance issues. Nitrification failure detection by N-Tox® is rapid, giving plant operators the time to take remedial action before possible release of ammonia. Recently presented data has shown the effectiveness of N-Tox® in providing early warning of nitrification inhibition following loss of aeration and ammonia overloading events. New data is now presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of N-Tox® in providing early warning of nitrification failure for a number of well-known toxic chemicals. These include the organic compound phenol, the nitrification suppressant allylthiourea (ATU) and the <b>inorganic</b> fungicide and <b>herbicide,</b> sodium azide. N-Tox® was able to detect nitrification failure when the first step of nitrification was inhibited, resulting in a rise in effluent ammonia, and when the second step was inhibited, resulting in a rise in effluent nitrite.

40|$|In Uganda, use of {{high-quality}} agricultural inputs like hybrid seed, agrochemicals, and fertilizer is extremely low. This depresses farm incomes {{and contributes to}} low agricultural productivity that continues to be hampered by poor agronomic practices, low quality germplasm, declining soil fertility, and losses due to pests, disease, and postharvest handling practices. Low levels of agricultural technology adoption have been compounded {{by a lack of}} farmer trust in the current inputs supply system, which has been plagued by counterfeiting. Counterfeit products range from benign fake or adulterated materials to banned substances that are harmful to crops and human health. Counterfeit agricultural inputs directly reduce productivity and, together with the perception of widespread counterfeiting, reduce demand for high-quality inputs. This lowers input prices and reduces profits for producers of genuine products, causing a form of “adverse selection” in which counterfeit products push high-quality genuine products out of the market. In the face of this problem, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative is supporting the development of a program for input quality assurance called e-verification (EV). E-verification involves labeling genuine agricultural inputs with a scratch-off label that provides an authentication code {{that can be used to}} confirm that the labeled product is genuine. Given the potential importance of this initiative, USAID is funding an independent impact evaluation of the effectiveness of the EV system at improving adoption {{of high-quality}} inputs and reducing the prevalence of counterfeiting. The impact evaluation will estimate the impact of the e-verification scheme on each of these outcomes and will examine how the e-verification project achieved its results. To undertake the impact evaluation, IFPRI conducted a baseline survey of communities, shops, and households. This survey resulted in the dataset contained in this study. The team identified ten major maize growing regions, termed market hubs, which covered districts (and surroundings) of Hoima, Iganga, Kasese, Kiboga, Luwero, Masaka, Masindi, Mbale, Mityana, and Mubende. Within these market hubs, the study sampled 120 market locations (trading centres or collections of shops) from which households source agricultural inputs. Within each market location, a matched pair of two villages was sampled. The baseline survey was targeted towards ten households in each of the 240 villages (LC 1 s). The sample ultimately resulted in 2, 378 households being surveyed.

40|$|Organic farming systems rely on {{improved}} soil quality and biological control favored by reduced tillage and pesticide application, organic fertilizer application and crop rotation management. The {{first part of}} this study focused on the impact of organic and conventional long-term farming (DOK Trial, Switzerland), primarily characterized by fertilizer types, on major aboveground generalist predator taxa (spiders, rove beetles and ground beetles) in structurally simple (winter wheat) and complex (grass-clover) agroecosystem. Most analyzed animal taxa that improve internal nutrient cycling and biological control in agroecosystems benefited from organic farming and several taxa were negatively affected by <b>inorganic</b> fertilizer or <b>herbicides</b> application. Spiders (Araneae) benefited most from organic farming in wheat fields. Similar to results from wheat fields, spiders were more active and diverse in organically managed grass-clover fields. In contrast to wheat fields, only surface-active spiders responded positive, with strongest responses early and late in the season. Prey availability and vegetation structure caused a numerical response of spiders in organically managed fields; both factors were further analyzed in a field experiment in wheat. Increasing the structural complexity between wheat stands reduced the activity-density of cursorial spiders and ground beetles (Carabidae). Web-building spiders and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) responded positively to experimentally enhanced availability of alternative non-pest prey (Collembola), but cursorial spiders and ground beetles did not mirror prey responses. Aphid numbers increased with increasing activity-density of alternative prey. Such positive prey-prey relationship potentially reduces pest suppression by generalist predators, as non-pest prey may distract predators from aphid prey. The role of generalist predators as biological control agents is further affected by cannibalism, intraguild predation and competition between predators. Spatial patterns of web-building spiders in alfalfa did not resemble the aggregation of available pest prey (aphids). In contrast web-owners had fewer neighbors in the vicinity of their webs than expected under a random distribution of spider webs in times of highest spider activity. Spiders were most affected by organic management in the DOK trial and experiments in grass-clover and alfalfa suggest strong intraguild interactions at high densities. To evaluate the consequences of functional group identity for pest suppression, two major spider functional groups (web-builders and cursorial spiders) were manipulated in a cage experiment in wheat. Cursorial spiders slowed down the initial aphid population growth, but none of the treatments prevented an aphid outbreak. Molecular studies strengthen this result, as they indicate that cursorial species had the highest proportion of individuals that tested positive for aphid DNA. Results {{of this study suggest that}} cursorial spiders may be of particular importance as natural enemies under organic farming. They responded most consistent to organic farming across agroecosystems with different structural complexity and successfully slowed down aphid population growth during early colonization stages. Future studies need to analyze the factors responsible for the reaction of generalist predators to farming methods. Results may further identify conditions under which enhanced predator numbers result in improved pest suppression...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about discoveries of the {{religious}} factor and its influence towards purchase intention of organic food in Malaysia. Each religion teaches its followers to consume healthy food in their daily lives. Organic food is commonly known for its healthier content {{without the use of}} pesticides, <b>herbicides,</b> <b>inorganic</b> fertilizers, antibiotics and growth hormones. To a certain extent organic food is directly related to Halal, a preconditioned to the Muslim to consume certain permitted foods and preparation. Organic chicken for instance is different from the ordinary chicken as the breeding and growth require the ‘natural way’ technique rather than the use of substance, vaccine and chemical to reduce the chicken maturity age. This is also subject to the use of unsafe and non-halal vaccine that is unhygienic and unsafe to consume. Furthermore, it also incorporates element of respects to the animal welfare which is consistent with the Shariah requirements. However, not every consumer view such circumstances as important though being encouraged by their religion to consume such food in a way promoted by the organic foods. The research aims to identify the religious factor and its impact towards the customer purchase intention in Malaysia. The findings of the study indicated that religious factor was found to have less impact on customer purchase intention of organic food. This is because the consumers could be looking on other vast factors such as perceived value and health consciousness in deciding to purchase organic food products. The consumers may be leaving the responsibility to the respective government enforcement agencies, local authorities and religious departments to look on both organic conventional foods produced and served in the country. They may also perceive that the existing conventional foods are perfectly matched with organic food and the consumers are fully confident that the foods are prepared in a way permitted by their religion. The result has shown some differences with the previous literature which described that religious factor plays {{one of the most influential}} roles in shaping food choice in certain countries of the world. To date, there have been very minimal studies conducted by taking into consideration the organic food especially to the consumers in Malaysia. Hence, this study is expected to provide understanding to both the industry players as well as academicians on the factors that influence Malaysian customer purchase intention towards organic food products as such phenomena might be different from one country to another. Future research should focus on the similar study of religious factor affecting customer purchase intention towards organic food products with the extended scope to all states in Peninsular Malaysia as well as in Sabah and Sarawak. By doing this, hopefully we can get a clearer picture on the tested existing and new variables which can be further examined. Eventually, a comparison can be made between the findings so that such constructible findings and conclusions can be made to the study.       </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of a suitable model for efficiency analysis {{is one of the}} most important issues in policy analysis. Given the recent interest in the use of distance functions as alternative representation of production technology, this study compares the empirical performances of the parametric stochastic input distance function to its nonparametric counterpart, data envelopment analysis. A further comparison is made between the alternatives of a distance and production function frontiers. It further integrates efficiency scores from the consistent approaches in order to evaluate the performance of the sampled farm households and for analysis of policy impacts on technical, allocative and cost efficiency. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is applied to smallholder maize production in Benue State Nigeria. The maize subsector has featured in a number of Nigeria’s policy initiatives, the most current of which involves doubling of its production and productivity through promotion of improved technologies such as hybrid seed, <b>inorganic</b> fertilizer, pesticides, <b>herbicides,</b> and better management practices. Despite the policy initiatives, maize productivity has remained low raising questions about the efficiency of resource use by farmers and the benefits of Nigeria’s technology policy. The study used data obtained from a field survey for the 2008 / 2009 agricultural year. A multistage stratified sampling technique was employed in {{selection of}} respondents. A total of 240 maize farm households were randomly selected and interviewed using structured questionnaires. Results from all the approaches indicated considerable technical, allocative and cost inefficiency under both traditional and improved maize technology. Technical efficiency estimates range from 80 to 87 percent. Allocative efficiency estimates range from 53 to 74 percent while cost efficiency estimates range from 45 to 62 percent. The results from all the approaches indicated that inefficiency in maize production in Benue State is dominated by cost inefficiency suggesting the immense potential of enhancing production through improvement in overall efficiency. The overall consistency check shows that technical, allocative and cost efficiency measures from the three distance functions were consistent whereas similar conclusions could not hold when these were compared to the production frontier especially for technical efficiency estimates. Given the consistency of results from the parametric and non-parametric distance functions, an integrated input distance model was developed for providing final efficiency estimates and analysis of policy impacts. The results show that both traditional and improved technology users were technically, allocatively and cost inefficient. The average technical, allocative and cost efficiency are 84. 2, 65. 7 and 54. 5 percent, respectively implying that there is a possibility of raising maize production by 45. 5 percent through overall efficiency improvement. Under the integrated approach, the study revealed that hybrid seeds, inorganic fertilizer and conservation practices have positive and significant impact on farm efficiency. Other determinants of efficiency include education, age, household size, land size, credit, and membership in a farmer group. The findings justify the need for further public investment in maize technology development and proper implementation of the relevant policies in order to enhance the efficiency with which maize has been produced thereby increasing its productivity, food security and farm incomes and subsequently reducing poverty in Nigeria.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{position of}} micro-algae {{at the base}} of the aquatic food web makes them critical components of aquatic ecosystems. Their short generation time also makes them useful biological indicators because they respond quickly to changes in environmental condition, enabling timely identification and assessment of water quality changes. The inclusion of micro-algae as indicators in water resource regulation and management in South Africa has started recently, their more extensive use in biomonitoring and ecotoxicology programmes for water resource management would contribute to the South African policy if water resource protection. The standard algal growth inhibition assay with the species Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata is currently used for monitoring toxicity of in-stream and industrial wastewater discharges to freshwater micro-algae. The relevance of the data generated by standard toxicity bioassays has been questioned, since micro-algae in particular are extremely variable in their sensitivity to a range of contaminants and these standard species used may not occur in the local aquatic environment. As a result, international regulatory agencies, have recommended algal growth inhibition tests be changed from a single standard species to tests with a number of species. One recommendation, in addition to the use of standard toxicity tests, is the use of species isolated from the local environment which may be more relevant for assessing site specific impacts. This study investigated the value and application of locally isolated South African freshwater micro-algae in toxicity tests for water resource management and was carried out in three phases. The first phase involved isolating micro-algae from South African aquatic resources. Micro-algae suitable for toxicity testing were identified and selected using as set of criteria. Three (Scenedesmus bicaudatus, Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlorella vulgaris) out of eight successfully isolated species satisfied the prescribed selection criteria and these were selected as potential toxicity test species. The second phase focused on refining and adapting the existing algal toxicity test protocol (the algal growth inhibition assay) for use on the locally isolated algal species. The refinement of the test protocol was achieved by exposing the locally isolated species to reference toxicants in order to assess and compare their growth and sensitivity to the toxicants under the prescribed toxicity test conditions with that of the standard toxicity test species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and a commercial laboratory species (Chlorella protothecoides). During this phase, one of the three local species (Scenedesmus bicaudatus) was eliminated as a potential toxicity test species due to inconsistent growth. The third phase of the study involved assessing the sensitivity of the two remaining species (C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana) to a range of toxicants (reference toxicants, salts, effluents and a herbicide) and comparing it to that of the standard toxicity test species P. subcapitata and C. protothecoides. The toxicants were selected based on their relative importance in the South African context, as well as the practicality of using these local micro-algae to routinely determine the impact of these toxicants on local aquatic resources. The growth of the four micro-algae was stimulated by the selected effluents. The standard toxicity test species P. subcapitata was ranked the most sensitive and of the four species to two reference toxicants and two inorganic salts. Chlorella sorokiniana was ranked the most sensitive of the three Chlorella species to two reference toxicants and two <b>inorganic</b> salts. The <b>herbicide</b> stimulated the growth of C. vulgaris while inhibiting the growth of the other species. Pseudokirchneriela subcapitata and C. sorokiniana showed high intra-specific variability in growth, which made it difficult to determine the effective concentrations of the herbicide and therefore compare the sensitivity of the species. This varied response of micro-algal species to toxicants may result in the biodiversity shifts in aquatic ecosystems, and also supports the recommendation of using a battery of different species to support more informed decisions in water resource management...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the uptake of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies, {{it is important to}} understand the contexts in which farmers operate. Farmers use different indicators to decide whether or not to implement, what to implement, and where to implement specific technologies. Identifying and understanding such indicators can be helpful to efforts aiming to scale out adoption. The purpose of this study was to identify indicators that farmers use to prioritize agricultural innovations, in general, and CSA, in particular. Kilolo and Mbarali Districts lie in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania. Four participatory workshops, in the form of focus group discussions, were conducted in these two districts. In each district, a separate workshop was held with farmers from each agro-ecological zone (AEZ). Separate workshops were held with farmers and experts to explore differences between stakeholders and across the districts regarding perceptions of the status of soil fertility, prioritized practices, and ranking of indicators for prioritizing practices. Characterization of the AEZ, prioritization of practices, identification of indicators for prioritizing CSA, and selection of practices for demonstration as well as sites for the demonstration plots were done separately with men and women groups. Practices were prioritized using pairwise ranking, while indicators were scored on a rating scale from least important (1) to most important (5). Results showed that, both in Kilolo and Mbarali Districts, farmers perceive the status of soil fertility as poor. Up to 60 % of the workshop participants were not satisfied with the status of soil fertility in their farms. More than 80 % of workshop participants in each of the four workshops reported that they practiced burning. The main reasons for burning were to save labour and time and to reduce crop–livestock conflict. The men’s group in the upland zone in Mbarali District ranked mulching, water harvesting, improved varieties, and crop rotation as the most important practices in respective order. In the lowlands, both men and women groups selected irrigation, chemical fertilizer, and crop rotation as most relevant practices. Awareness and use of the practices was low among participants in the two workshops. The most prioritized practices by the women’s group in the uplands, Kilolo District, were improved breeds and improved varieties. Intercropping was the least prioritized practice. The men’s group prioritized improved varieties and pesticides application, while irrigation and fertilizer application ranked lowest. In the lowlands, men’s and women’s groups prioritized irrigation, inorganic fertilizer and improved varieties as most important. Mulching and herbicides ranked as least prioritized. In addition, the men’s group from the lowland zone ranked pesticide application among the most important practices, while farmyard manure and zero grazing were ranked as least important. Important indicators that farmers identified to prioritize agricultural practices across the two districts included yield, income, cost, labour, availability of inputs, the status of soil fertility, and knowledge about the practices. Several practices were selected for the proposed CSA demonstration plots. The women’s group in the uplands zone in Mbarali prioritized improved crop varieties, water harvesting, mulching, and fertilizer application. The men’s group chose irrigation, <b>herbicides,</b> <b>inorganic</b> fertilizers, and seed selection. In the lowlands, improved crop varieties, inorganic fertilizer, farmyard manure, and mulching were selected by women. Men preferred seed preparation, right use of fertilizers (i. e., rate and type), integrated pest management, and improved storage. The selected important practices for demonstration in the uplands in Kilolo District were minimum tillage, soil testing, improved varieties, fertilizer application, and irrigation. Farmers in the lowlands chose production of clean seeds of different crops, such as tomatoes, beans, maize, and chillies. In addition, they were interested in learning about fertilizer application, pesticides application, and preparation and application of compost manure. The findings of this research have several implications for policy. First, there is need to increase awareness of farmers about CSA practices, particularly those that they prioritize. The finding that farmers perceive poor soil fertility but do not prioritize soil fertility management practices implies the need to promote adoption of such technologies. Thirdly, a bottom-up approach that involves working with farmers to prioritize agricultural practices suitable for their specific AEZ and preferred by either the men or women is important to inform investment of limited resources to increase food security and resilience to climate risks while minimizing trade-offs. The findings highlight indicators that influence farmers’ adoption of agricultural practices as well as constraints to implementation...|$|R
40|$|Rice yield is {{generally}} low (2. 7 t ha(- 1) in 2008) in Cambodia. Increase of rice production remains {{the central focus}} of Cambodia's agricultural policy for potential export for economic development and for livelihood improvement for rural population. Paddy rice is grown over diverse water environments in Cambodia; (1) irrigation rehabilitation area of those constructed during Pol Pot time, (2) deepwater rice ecosystem in flood plains of Tonle Sap Lake, (3) rainfed lowland rice ecosystem sharing over 80 % of Riceland in Cambodia. Rice yield should be increased in every rice ecosystem for food security and better livelihood for farmers. This study focused on (1) heterogeneous water environments within a village or within a landscape of human sight (i. e. defined as "micro-scale" in this thesis) {{within each of the}} rice ecosystems, (2) transfer and adoption of technologies available for farmers, and (3) positive externalities (i. e. multifunctional roles) of rice farming such as biodiversity conservation, landscape or cultural values, in order to improve rice yield in sustainable manner. Analysis on the process of irrigation rehabilitation in Kamping Puoy in Battambang province, Northwest Cambodia, in the consecutive 4 cropping seasons from 2008 wet season rice to 2010 dry season rice revealed standing water depth (e. g. from September to November) much deeper in downstream fields than in upstream fields along the transect of the secondary drainage canals in wet season rice; farmers adapted to plant medium and late maturing varieties (maturity time in December and January) in the former while early and early medium maturing varieties (maturity time in November) in the latter. Water conditions were less different between upstream and downstream fields in dry season rice and with more uniform planting and harvesting time. As the area percentage of fields where dry season rice was introduced increased from 2008 (54 %) to 2010 (100 %), planting time in wet season rice shifted later (e. g., from May to July) with declining proportion of dry seeding method and mid-season tillage. On-farm grain yields in DSR were low (287 and 247 g m(- 2) in 2009 and 2010 on average, respectively), partly due to insufficient weed control and small amounts of fertilizers. Yields were lowest in fields which practiced dry season rice for the first time, and some improper management practices (such as variety mis-choice, wrong use of insecticides instead of fungicide) were observed, indicating insufficient agriculture extension support to farmers. Grain yield in WSR (286 and 291 g m(- 2) in 2008 and 2009 respectively) could be increased by transplanting, use of high yielding Raing Chey variety, and application of higher amount of N inorganic fertilizer. Characterization of deepwater rice area in the flood plain of Tonle Sap Lake in Northwest Cambodia along a transect of water depth gradient (from the shallower rainfed lowlands side to the deeper floating rice side) during wet season rice production in 2008, 2009 and 2010 revealed (A) very gentle and almost flat slope (only 40 cm elevation differences in 1 km distance) and 3 groups of rice zones with (1) upper fields located closer to the National Road Number 5 where water depth was shallower and only lowland rice was grown; (2) middle fields where both lowland rice and floating rice were grown and where lowest grain yield was recorded in 2009 due to the flood; and (3) lower fields located near to the Lake where water depth was deeper (average maximum depth more than 150 cm) and only floating rice was grown. (B) Secondly it was also revealed large yearly differences in flood from Tonle Sap Lake; 2008 and 2009 when water came to the paddy fields from both the inundation from Tonle Sap Lake and rainfall and when the presence of continuous standing water started in September, reached maximum in October (> 1 m) and became non-flooded conditions in early December vs. 2010 when flood did not come from the Lake and all the 3 rice zones had less than 30 cm of maximum water depth and when rainfed lowland rice attained higher yield due to higher N fertilizer application rate. The overall average grain yield for both years of 2009 and 2010 was low with only 1. 1 t ha(- 1) for floating rice and 1. 8 t ha(- 1) for lowland rice. Late sowing and/or lack of basal N fertilizer application resulted in smaller plant stands when flood occurred, resulting in greater flood damage and more crop failure. Limited forecasting ability for water availability (e. g., flood occurrence) for the subsequent cropping season leave large risks for deep water rice production in flood plains of Tonle Sap Lake. The study showed that grain yield was very low (1. 5 t ha(- 1)) in the studied area in rainfed lowland rice in Kompong Chhnang province because farmers planted only local varieties on poor soil fertility with the low rate of inorganic fertilizer (14 kg ha(- 1)). Results of onstation experiments in wet season rice 2009 and 2010 showed that yield was improved by planting improved variety (e. g. Phka Rumdoul) and applying the recommended amount of fertilizer. Yield of Phka Rumduol with fertilizer application could be 60 % higher than that of Thmar-Ror-meal (local variety) with fertilizer and more than triple that of Thmar-Ror-meal without fertilizer in 2009. However the efficient level of improved variety and fertilizer was less in wet season rice 2010 because of water defict. Adoption level of improved variety and fertilizer depends on the availability and popularity of these resources among the farmers. Farmers preferred to grow Phka Rumduol in wet season rice 2010 but the adopted area was not high due to the seed shortage. On the other hand, fertilizer was not highly adopted by farmers in wet season rice 2010 due to unavailability of fertilizer (lack of money to purchase) and farmers'concerns on low benefit return in the drought situation. Multifunctionalities of the 3 rice ecosystems (irrigated rice, deepwater rice and rainfed lowland rice) in Cambodia were recognized, such as those categorized as (1) livelihood and economic, (2) environment, and (3) social and cultural, at least in local scale among villagers, although the value of each function has not been quantitatively estimated. Bioresources from paddy fields are important to farmers'livelihood, particularly poor people. This study shows that (1) water environments are different not only between the rice ecosystems but also within each of the rice ecosystems at micro-scale i. e. between upstream and downstream fields along secondary canals in irrigated rice ecosystem, transect from rainfed lowland side towards the lake in deep water rice ecosystem in flood plains of Tonle Sap Lake, toposequential differences within a village in rainfed lowland ecosystem. The micro-scale variation in water conditions has large influences on farming practices and yield, so the characterization of field water environments is important for technology development and dissemination; (2) insufficient and ineffective usage of agricultural resources (e. g., <b>inorganic</b> N fertilizer, <b>herbicides,</b> fungicides, photoperiod sensitive variety) caused lower farm level yield than possible attainable level in all the 3 rice ecosystems in Cambodia. In rainfed lowland ecosystem while an improved variety of Phkar Rumduol was rapidly and popularly adopted by farmers but in short of seeds multiplication, adoption of sufficient amount of inorganic fertilizer was hindered by water deficit and influenced by the cost-benefit balance; and (3) multifunctionlaities of rice production were recognized at village or landscape levels such as other biological resources for livelihood, should be up-scaled in order to draw attention of policy makers to attain sustainable rice farming in Cambodia. 報告番号: 甲 27574; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 10 - 07; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3730 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科生産・環境生物学専...|$|R
