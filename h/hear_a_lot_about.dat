5000|$|NBC {{spends a}} smaller portion of {{coverage}} time on {{women than men}} in the Winter Olympics, but during the summer Olympics women seem to get a more equal share of attention. In the 2012 summer Games, NBC actually spent more time on women than men, and women received 55% of clock time within NBC’s telecast at the London games.2 “If your primary concern is to see the US win medals, {{the last couple of}} Olympics, the women are winning the majority of the medals, so you’re going to be showing more women’s sport,” says Billings.2 When women’s sports are covered in the media, that doesn’t mean they are represented well by the commentators. There will generally be comments about how women’s sports are years behind men’s sports in what the athletes are able to accomplish. You also <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> how a women was lucky if she succeeded in a sport, rather than about her ability and commitment. The women in non-contact or graceful, less aggressive sports, have been getting much more TV time. If you’re a gymnast, diver, runner, swimmer, or volleyball player, you’re more likely to be covered. If you compete in judo or shotput, you’re out of luck. Women’s beach volleyball tends {{to get a lot of}} coverage, but there are arguments over why this is so. Although it is an awesome sport and America happens to have some of the best sand volleyball players there are, it is questionable if they receive more coverage because of their talent, or because of their outfits. In 2008, when all four American Olympic volleyball teams (beach and indoor, men’s and women’s) medaled, the women’s beach volleyball team received more coverage than either men’s team; the women’s indoor team wasn’t covered at all.2 ...|$|E

We also <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> a group of 1960 s conceptualists called the Artist Placement Group, who brokered some of the earliest artists’ residencies in industry and government in the UK. In 1966, when APG was founded, the art world regarded ‘tangling with the dirt’ of commerce and the public sector as an anomaly, even an aberration within art. Today, on the other hand, such tangling has come to define large swathes of artistic practice. Operating with few precedents, APG worked hard to formulate a rigorous methodology of engagement – one that makes many of today’s ubiquitous residencies appear complacent, and complicit, by comparison. With art having long since burst its disciplinary banks, APG’s early excursions outside the white cube’s perimeter also shed light on the emerging hybrid landscape of business art, art & science, socially engaged art and even network art. This summer, Josephine Berry and Pauline van Mourik Broekman talked to APG co-founders Barbara Steveni and John Latham, both artists in their own right, and discovered their sometimes quite different approaches to the organisation and its implication...|$|E
