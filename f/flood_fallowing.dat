50|$|One {{control method}} is to improve soil {{conditions}} because F. oxysporum spreads faster through soils that have high moisture and bad drainage. Other control methods include planting resistant varieties, removing infected plant tissue to prevent overwintering of the disease, using soil and systemic fungicides to eradicate the disease from the soil, <b>flood</b> <b>fallowing,</b> and using clean seeds each year. Applying fungicides depends on the field environment. It {{is difficult to find}} a biological control method because research in a greenhouse can have different effects than testing in the field. The best control method found for F. oxysporum is planting resistant varieties, although not all have been bred for every forma specialis.|$|E

25|$|Black-necked storks forage in {{a variety}} of natural and {{artificial}} wetland habitats. They frequently use freshwater, natural wetland habitats such as lakes, ponds, marshes, flooded grasslands, oxbow lakes, swamps, rivers and water meadows. Freshwater, artificial wetland habitats used by these storks include <b>flooded</b> <b>fallow</b> and paddy fields, wet wheat fields, irrigation storage ponds and canals, sewage ponds, and dry floodplains. In cultivated areas, they prefer natural wetlands to forage in, though flooded rice paddies are preferentially used during the monsoon, likely due to excessive flooding of lakes and ponds. Nests are usually on trees that are located in secluded parts of large marshes or in cultivated fields as in India.|$|R
40|$|Author abstract]The greater fairy moss, Azolla japonica, a water fern, {{was found}} to {{distribute}} in the paddy fields of the limited areas in Kawachi, the eastmost region of the Osaka plain. In the summer season Azolla (A) grows and multiplicates vigorously on the flooded paddy field with the other floating weeds such as Spirodela (S) and Lemna (L). An investigation showed {{that the number of}} paddy fields and areas of the water surface occupied by the weed species were larger as follows; S>L>A. The growth rates of those weeds cultured in the nutrient solution were, however, larger as follows; L>S>A, and the dominant order in the competition for occupying the water surface in contact with each other was thought to be as follows; A>S>L. The Azolla was well grown in the nitrogen free nutrient solution at relatively acidic PH range. They doubled the fresh weight and the covering area on the water surface in 5 to 6 days in the growing season. Some possible utilization of the Azolla in our country may be for the environmental rather than the agricultural practices. By "cultivation" of the Azolla in a <b>flooded</b> <b>fallow</b> paddy field, it may contribute to reducing the water pollution or the eutrophication in the environmental water system. [著者抄録]大阪平野の東部に位置する河内地方では生駒山系に接する植く限られた地区の湿田にオオアカウキクサ,Azolla japonica,が残存し,夏季その周辺の水田に他の浮草類と共に繁殖するのが観察されている. そこで八尾市東部地区の水田において 7 月中旬Azollaの分布を調べたところ,本植物はウキクサ(Spirodela) やアオウキクサ(Lemna) と混生しておよそ 20 %の水田に分布していた. またこの地区の水田では,これら浮草の中でApirodelaがもっとも広面積に,次いでLemna,Azollaの順に水田表面を覆っていた. 3 種の浮草をそれぞれポット内の水耕液(市販ミネラップ液) で約 1 ケ月培養し,それらの葉状体の生長(増殖) 速度を見るとLemna>Spirodela>Azollaの関係でそれぞれ 3 ～ 4 倍の差があった. このような生長・増殖速度の差は葉状体の薄さの差を反映しているが,反面これらの浮草類が接触して増殖する競り合いにおいては,分厚い葉状体をもち密なマット状群落をつくるAzollaがもっとも優位で,次いでSpirodela>Lemnaの順と思われる. Azollaはロングアシュトンの無窒素培養液で他の窒素源を含む場合よりもその初期増殖速度は大であった. この培養実験での最大成長速度植から倍量増加時間を求めると 5. 3 日となったが,この値はなお培養条件の改善で小となることが予想される. Azollaはミネラップ培養液のpH 4 ～ 7 の範囲で盛んに増殖したが,その至適pHは 6 前後と思われ,また繁殖期の水田のpHは 6. 5 前後であった. わが国の今日の農業にAzollaを直接的に利用することは現実的に期し難い,しかし,本植物の窒素固定能以外に水溶液からの富栄養物質(例えば,リン酸) 吸収能,水面被覆能および周年生育性等に基いて,これを休耕田や輪作,転換作付体系の中の湛水田で"栽培"して,化学肥料や農薬多投を軽減し,水系の水質の浄化への利用も考えられる...|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} of indigenous and introduced strains of Azorhizobium caulinodans in flooded soil {{and in the}} rice rhizosphere, where in situ Sesbania rostrata was incorporated before the rice crop, is reported. The azorhizobia studied were both root and stem nodulating. In a pot experiment, two crop cycles each of inoculated and noninoculated Sesbania-rice were compared with two crop cycles of flooded fallow-rice. In a field experiment, the effect of repeated incorporation of in situ S. rostrata in the Sesbania-rice sequence was studied. Soils in which inoculated S. rostrata was incorporated contained about 3, 000 times more azorhizobia than did soils in the <b>flooded</b> <b>fallow</b> treatment and about 50 times more azorhizobia than did soils in the noninoculated Sesbania treatment. Azorhizobial numbers in the inoculated Sesbania treatment declined toward rice harvest but remained much {{higher than in the}} flooded fallow-rice treatment. Repeated incorporation of S. rostrata increased the population density of indigenous soil azorhizobia, whereas the population of inoculated strain ORS 571 (Strr Spcr) declined to an undetectable level; this finding suggested low competitiveness by the introduced strain. In the incorporated Sesbania treatment, the rice rhizosphere harbored significantly more A. caulinodans and supported higher nitrogenase activity per plant than did the rhizosphere of the flooded fallow-rice treatment. Sterile rice seedlings inoculated with A. caulinodans showed nitrogenase activity comparable to that of seedlings inoculated with Azospirillum lipoferum 34 H, a rice root isolate. Rhizobia from Sesbania aculeata, Sesbania sesban, a Trifolium sp., and Vigna unguiculata did not support appreciable nitrogenase activity...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{fields in}} the tropics can vary in water regime before {{production}} of rice on flooded soil, but relatively {{little is known about}} the effects of soil water regime and crop residue management between rice crops (i. e., fallow period) on methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions during a subsequent rice crop. We measured CH 4  and N 2 O emissions during two cropping seasons in the Philippines from field plots exposed to contrasting treatments during the fallow before land preparation for rice cultivation. The fallow treatments were continuous soil flooding (flooded), soil drying with exclusion of rainfall (dry), soil drying with dry tillage (dry + tillage), and a control with soil drying and wetting from rainfall (dry and wet). All plots were subdivided into removal of all aboveground rice residues from the previous crop (without residue) and retention of standing biomass after harvest of the previous rice crop (with residue). Emitted gas was collected weekly using chambers. Fallow treatments greatly influenced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during rice growth. Methane emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in both cropping seasons were highest following the <b>flooded</b> <b>fallow,</b> intermediate following the dry and wet fallow, and lowest following dry and dry + tillage fallows. The GWP was higher with than without residue across all fallow treatments. Nitrous oxide emissions were small during the season, and CH 4  emissions contributed more than 90 % of the cumulative GWP during the rice crop regardless of fallow and residue management. Soil drying between rice crops in the tropics can reduce CH 4  emissions and GWP during the subsequent rice crop...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{forests in}} the flood plains are {{important}} from the ecological, social and economical point of view. In this paper the management of these areas and their contribution to the economy of riverine communities in the Jenaro Herrera district is presented. A total of 108 families in 12 communities located in the flood plains about Jenaro Herrera were interviewed. Eighty six {{percent of the land}} holders had their cropping areas located in the physiographic unit ‘restinqa’, particularly in the new communities. Existing secondary forest fallows (locally called ‘purmas’) in the flood plains were part of the cropping rotation cycle. Forty eight percent of the interviewed people were carrying out some management in their forest fallows, this being more intense in the ‘high restinga’. Species under silvicultural treatment were mainly Cedrela odorato (cedro) and Calicophyllum pruceanum (capiroria negra). <b>Flood</b> plain <b>fallows</b> provide around 7 % of natural resources extracted in the zone, whereas fruits are the highest contribution in the total value of products...|$|R
40|$|Results {{based on}} a {{socioeconomic}} survey on <b>flood</b> plain forest <b>fallows</b> are presented. The study was aimed at identifying the factors influencing people's decisions on land use and forest resource utilisation, and to provide some preliminary biophysical information. It was found that 93 % of local landholders predominantly use low "restinga" sites, and that the major reason for forest fallows is to recover soil fertility. Furthermore, forest conversion and re-conversion processes are a function of community age and parcel size. Over 50 % of landholders manage their forest fallows mainly to encourage two tree species: Calycophyllum spruceanum (capiro na) and Cedrela odorata (cedro). The {{results of this study}} are encouraging to promote local forests fallows management plans...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) in soil and plants in agricultural land near an electronic waste recycling site in east China {{has become a}} great threat to the neighboring environmental quality and human health. Soil and plant samples collected from land under different utilization, including fallow plots, vegetable plots, plots with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as green manure, fallow plots under long-term <b>flooding</b> and <b>fallow</b> plots under alternating wet and dry periods, together with plant samples from relative plots were analyzed for six PAE compounds nominated as prior pollutants by USEPA. In the determined samples, the concentrations of six target PAE pollutants ranged from 0. 31 - 2. 39 mg/kg in soil to 1. 81 - 5. 77 mg/kg in various plants (dry weight/DW), and their bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranged from 5. 8 to 17. 9. Health risk assessments were conducted on target PAEs, known as typical environmental estrogen analogs, based on their accumulation in the edible parts of vegetables. Preliminary risk assessment to human health from soil and daily vegetable intake indicated that DEHP may present a high-exposure risk on all ages {{of the population in}} the area by soil ingestion or vegetable consumption. The potential damage that the target PAE compounds may pose to human health should be taken into account in further comprehensive risk assessments in e-waste recycling sites areas. Moreover, alfalfa removed substantial amounts of PAEs from the soil, and its use can be considered a good strategy for in situ remediation of PAEs...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{population}} levels of Meloidogyne hapla, M. incognita, Pratylenchus coffeae, and P. penetrans were studied in 12 strawberry {{fields in the}} Dahu region of Taiwan. Ten potential rotation crops and two cultural practices were evaluated for their effect on nematode populations and influence on strawberry yield. Rotation with rice or taro and the cultural practice of <b>flooding</b> and bare <b>fallowing</b> for four months were found to reduce nematode soil populations to two or fewer nematodes per 100 ml soil. Average strawberry yields increased between 2. 4 % to 6. 3 % following taro compared to the bare fallow treatment. Corn suppressed M. incognita and M. hapla populations and resulted in an increased in strawberry yield compared to bare fallow. Other phytopathogens also present in these fields limited taro as the rotation choice for nematode management. Results of this research and economic analysis of the input requirements for various rotation crops, corn and bare fallow were recommended as the most appropriate rotation strategies for nematode management in strawberry in this region...|$|R
30|$|Meloidogyne spp. {{have been}} {{frequent}} targets of management by crop rotation in Egypt and worldwide. Since strawberry is transplanted in Egypt as a winter crop in September and October, {{it is usually}} rotated with traditional summer crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsuture), soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), or peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Such summer crops have been useful in rotation sequences for suppressing certain species and races of RKNs (e.g., McSorley and Gallaher 1991; Rodriguez-Kabana et al. 1991; Chen and Tsay 2006; Abd-Elgawad and Askary 2015). Chen and Tsay (2006) evaluated ten potential rotation crops and two cultural practices for their effect on nematode population levels of root-knot and lesion nematodes and influence on strawberry yield in 12 fields. They found that rotation with rice or taro and the cultural practice of <b>flooding</b> and bare <b>fallowing</b> for 4 [*]months could reduce nematode soil populations to two or fewer nematodes per 100 [*]cm 3 soil. Average strawberry yields increased between 2.4 to 6.3 % following taro compared to the bare fallow treatment. Also, corn could suppress RKN populations and resulted {{in an increase in}} strawberry yield compared to bare fallow. Based on economic analysis, they concluded that corn and bare fallow were the most appropriate rotation strategies for nematode management in strawberry in Dahu region of Taiwan. On the other hand, suppression of PPNs is particularly challenging on Egyptian strawberry where short crop sequences are frequently followed as strawberry last in soil from September to October till May. Eventually, caution should be exercised especially when such sequential crops are susceptible hosts or if infestations of multiple nematode species are found (Westphal 2011). On the other hand, observations indicate that fallowing for short durations coupled with early crop destruction and plowing can result in considerable and immediate reduction in total soil-borne pathogens, weeds, and nematode population densities in soil. Therefore, many Egyptian farmers follow this technique via summer fallow for 1 – 2 [*]months during hottest months. Since soil type and soil organic matter content can also dramatically affect PPN population levels, the use of soil amendments might prove useful for control (Abd-Elgawad and Askary 2015; Noling 2016).|$|R
