40|$|A common {{deficiency}} of discretized datasets is that detail beyond {{the resolution of}} the dataset has been irrecoverably lost. This lack of detail becomes immediately apparent once one attempts to zoom into the dataset and only recovers blur. Here, we describe a method that generates the missing detail from any available and plausible high-resolution data, using texture synthesis. Since the detail generation process is guided by the underlying image or volume data and is designed to fill in plausible detail in accordance with the coarse structure and properties of the zoomed-in neighborhood, we refer to our method as constrained texture synthesis. Regular zooms become “semantic zooms”, where each level of <b>detail</b> <b>stems</b> from a data source attuned to that resolution. We demonstrate our approach by a medical application – the visualization of a human liver – but its principles readily apply to any scenario, as long as data at all resolutions are available.

The advantageous features of the modified impregnation materials compared to those made by conventional impregnation include a smaller average particle size, an optimized random alloy composition, and improved compositional uniformity from particle-to-particle resulting in higher activity and stability compared to the catalysts prepared using both conventional impregnation and sol immobilization methods. <b>Detailed</b> <b>STEM</b> combined with EDX analyses of individual particles have revealed that an increase in anion concentration increases the gold content of individual particles in the resultant catalyst, thus providing a method to control/tune {{the composition of the}} nanoalloy particles.

40|$|To {{characterize}} growth partitioning {{within the}} tree and its responses to climate, we studied 8 dominant beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) of a pure, even-aged 98 -year-old stand in Belgium. We sampled 10 disks along the stem from breast height to treetop and examined the inter-annual patterns of, and discrepancies between, ring-area and volume increments by performing <b>detailed</b> <b>stem</b> analysis and dendroecological investigations. Although the common inter-annual variation among all increment series was high, we observed increasing growth variability and climate sensitivity with height, leading to notable bole-crown discrepancies. Both the common inter-annual variation and bole-crown discrepancies were mainly driven by summer heat waves and related droughts of the previous year, and spring droughts of the current year. Despite these discrepancies, the radial growth at breast height {{can be considered a}} good estimate of the tree volume increment but not for the purpose of focusing on climatic effects of isolated years.

40|$|Nanocrystalline CeO 2 was {{prepared}} by precipitation {{of a solution}} of the acetate using supercritical CO 2 as an antisolvent. It was demonstrated that gold supported on this material is very active for the oxidation of CO at ambient temperature, particularly in comparison with CeO 2 prepared in a conventional manner by thermal decomposition of the acetate. Comparing the catalytic performance for CO oxidation with the most active catalysts in the current literature confirms the high activity of these new materials. They are considerably more active than previous Au/CeO 2 catalysts. The catalyst activity {{was found to be}} dependent on the precipitation conditions, which in turn was found to influence the dispersion of gold on the support, as evidenced by detailed microscopy and spectroscopy characterization. The most active fresh catalyst exhibited highly dispersed gold and showed no evidence of the existence of Au nanocrystals using <b>detailed</b> <b>STEM</b> analysis. Following reaction with CO/O 2, subtle microstructural changes were apparent, although the morphology of the nanocrystalline CeO 2 support was unchanged; in particular, the Au, which was previously uniformly dispersed, showed signs of beginning to agglomerate into sub- 5 nm particles.

40|$|International audienceThe Regional Curve Standardization (RCS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} standardization methods to remove biological signals in long tree ring chronologies. The approach assumes that an overall age-related growth trend typify all tree ring series to be included in a standardized tree ring chronology. Although several potential problems of the method have been examined, the influence of varying the sampling height along tree stems has not been evaluated. Considering that age-related growth trends may vary with stem height, biases may arise when combining samples from unknown or variable sampling heights, a frequent situation with subfossil logs. In this study we perform a <b>detailed</b> <b>stem</b> analysis of 15 lakeshore black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B. S. P.) trees in the taiga of eastern Canada to describe how the age-related growth trend varies with stem height and evaluate associated biases in RCS chronologies built from living and subfossil trees. Results show that the age-related growth trends vary markedly and systematically along stems, potentially generating large methodological biases in RCS chronologies, especially near the recent chronology end. These biases may lead to erroneous reconstructions of recent climatic trends and cause false divergence between tree ring and climate series. We have developed a correction procedure that appears efficient in removing these biases from chronologies built with the lakeshore trees and associated subfossil logs...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis arose from a concern that the data being obtained from the yield research plots maintained by the Forest Research Institute of the New Zealand Forest Service were inadequate for present day yield research. This was partly {{because some of the}} data were considered to be inaccurate and partly because of deficiencies in the types of data being collected. It was thought that one solution to the problem would be to give each plot a detailed final measurement to obtain additional data to supplement those collected during the life of the plot. The first section of the thesis describes the methods of data collection and processing used for the plots, and includes a detailed comparison between data available in the plot records and data obtained from a <b>detailed</b> <b>stem</b> analysis of each of the trees in two of the plots. It is shown that there are errors in both the basic and the computed data, the errors being such that the data are considered unsuitable for detailed research into methods of constructing growth models, particularly those models based on the growth of individual trees. Further analysis of the data collected for {{the first part of the}} study suggested that it is feasible to perform a final measurement of each plot during which selected sample trees would be subjected to a stem analysis. The results indicate that a minimum of ten trees per plot should be selected and that sample points should be located near the base of every second annual shoot in each tree. Not only would such a procedure provide accurate data on the growth of individual trees, but it would enable a reduction to be made in the amount of measurement necessary during the life of a plot, thereby reducing the cost of the periodic remeasurements...|$|R
