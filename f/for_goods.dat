5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> or services. However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest coins were punch marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|E

The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road.

5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> throughout Arab and African states.

5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> and services.|$|E

5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E
