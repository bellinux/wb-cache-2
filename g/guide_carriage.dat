40|$|Abstract. AGV {{is short}} for {{automated}} guided vehicle. AGV is unmanned automated <b>guided</b> <b>carriage</b> car equipped with a non-contact guidance with microcontroller as controlling core and battery as power. The basic functions of the AGV are driving automated, recognizing the site to stop and transfering loads. AGV has been more widely used, {{because it is a}} key equipment of flexible manufacturing systems and an important mean of modern logistics systems. Guidance technology is the most critical core technology in AGV system. In this paper the author consult a lot of relevant books and mainly compares principle of a variety of AGV navigation technologies,analyzes the advantages and disadvantages and forecast the trend of the agv guidance technology development in the future so that relevant researchers can do further research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} two control {{approaches for}} a linear axis with pneumatic muscles. Its <b>guided</b> <b>carriage</b> {{is driven by}} a nonlinear drive system consisting of two pulley tackles with pneumatic muscle actuators arranged at both sides. This innovative drive concept allows for an increased workspace as well as higher carriage velocities as compared to a direct actuation. Both proposed control schemes have a cascaded structure, where the control design is based on backstepping techniques. Hysteresis in the force characteristic of the pneumatic muscles is considered by an asymmetric shifted Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, while remaining uncertainties are compensated using an adaptive backstepping strategy. The main difference between both approaches is the usage of either the internal muscle pressures or the muscle forces as controlled variables of the inner control loops. Both control approaches have been implemented on a test-rig and show an excellent closed-loop performance...|$|R

50|$|Catch {{points and}} trap points are types of turnout which act as railway safety devices. Both work by <b>guiding</b> railway <b>carriages</b> and trucks from a {{dangerous}} route onto a separate, safer track. Catch points {{are used to}} derail vehicles which {{are out of control}} on steep slopes (known as runaways). Trap points are used to protect main railway lines from unauthorised vehicles moving onto them from sidings or branch lines. Either of these track arrangements may lead the vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, track arrangements which are used to safely stop them after they have left the main tracks.|$|R
50|$|Rutting {{can also}} be intentional. The ancient Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians and Greeks {{constructed}} roads with artificial wheel-ruts deliberately cut into rock. The ruts were spaced apart from each other the same distance as the wheelspan of an ordinary carriage, and thus constituted grooves that <b>guided</b> the <b>carriages</b> on the rutway. Such ancient stone rutways connected major cities with sacred sites, such as Athens to Eleusis, Sparta to Ayklia, or Elis to Olympia. The gauge of these stone grooves was 1.38 to 1.44 m. The largest number of preserved stone trackways, over 150, are found on Malta.|$|R
5000|$|The {{warp beam}} {{was at the}} top, and the work roller at the bottom. There was a sley and a <b>guide</b> bar.The <b>{{carriages}}</b> with their bobbins (brass bobbins) slid on a concave comb (bolt). In the 1825 modification, the carriages were suspended from a upwardly arching comb. The carriages are propelled by individual pusher rods which strike the ears on the carriage. There was pusher bar (later there were four) {{but there is a}} fetcher bar (locker bar) which act in conjunctions with the pushers [...] It was slow and in the early machine 14 actions were required to form each course; in 1825 this had been reduced to ten. The bobbins were necessarily small and this restricted the length of a single piece to about 4 metres The actions were controlled by an organ barrel until the adoption of the Jacquard process in 1839. This was achieved by James Wright of Radford.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{purchasing}} TV <b>Guide</b> Channel <b>carriage</b> rights, some {{services such}} as Optimum and Bright House Networks created their own scrolling listings grids, with Optimum's occasionally being interrupted by full-screen commercials, and otherwise featuring banner ads accompanied by music. Bright House's version featured a video inlay of a local news station instead of banner ads, with its overall on-screen presentation otherwise matching that of Optimum's. Other cable providers that did not carry TV Guide Channel carried a similar television listings channel provided by entertainment and listings website Zap2It. DirecTV did not begin carrying the TV Guide Channel until 2004, and began carrying it in an entirely full-screen format (without the bottom listings grid) in 2005. This was also the case with Dish Network, which aired the network in full-screen format to avoid duplication of its set top receiver-integrated IPG, also provided by Gemstar-TV Guide (another satellite provider, Primestar, had also carried the channel with the grid included, until it merged with DirecTV in 1999 shortly after the rebrand to TV Guide Channel).|$|R
60|$|Impassive, as behoves {{its high}} breeding, the Dedlock town house {{stares at the}} other houses in the street of dismal {{grandeur}} and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within. Carriages rattle, doors are battered at, the world exchanges calls; ancient charmers with skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly bloom upon them seen by daylight, when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together, dazzle the eyes of men. Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging <b>carriages</b> <b>guided</b> by short-legged coachmen in flaxen wigs, deep sunk into downy hammercloths, and up behind mount luscious Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise, a spectacle for the angels.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, at any rate, {{let us go}} to Wittenberg," [...] said I; [...] "get a <b>guide,</b> a <b>carriage,</b> cannot you?" [...] as I {{walked to}} one window of the station house and another, and looked out to see {{something}} wonderful. Nothing was in sight, however; and after the usual sputter of gutturals which precedes any arrangement in this country, we were mounted in a high, awkward carriage, and rode to the town. Two ancient round tower and a wall first met my eye; then a drawbridge, arched passage, and portcullis. Under this passage we passed, and at our right hand was the church, where once was laid the worn form that had stood so many whirlwinds--where, in short, Luther was buried. But this we did not then know; so we drove by, {{and went to a}} hotel. Talked English and got German; talked French with no better success. At last, between W., G., and the dictionary, managed to make it understood that we wanted a guide to the Luther relics. A guide was after a time forthcoming, in the person of a little woman who spoke no English, whom, guide book in hand, we followed.|$|R
60|$|Darkness {{had set in}} now, and Ney, {{finding it}} {{impossible}} {{to make his way}} further, and feeling sure that had the Emperor been still at Krasnoi he would have sent a force to his assistance, fell back into the forest. His position was a desperate one; the scanty supply of provisions with which they had started was exhausted, and they were in an unknown country, surrounded by foes, without a <b>guide,</b> without <b>carriage</b> for the wounded, without an idea of the direction in which to march. The Russian general sent in two flags of truce, offering him terms of capitulation which would save the life of himself and of his brave soldiers. Ney, however, was not yet conquered. He detained the messengers with the flags of truce, lest they might take news to their general of the position of his force, and then, with all capable of the exertion, continued his march. They passed in silence within half a mile of the Cossack fires, and reaching a village on the Dnieper, attempted the passage; but the ice broke under the first gun, and it was necessary to abandon the whole of the artillery and every vehicle.|$|R

40|$|The current {{article is}} practice-oriented and is {{intended}} for shipowners and sea carriers {{as well as for}} practitioners and students who wish to revise or expand their knowledge on this specific area of the carriage of goods by sea. The paper provides the reader with a thorough understanding of the main instrument regulating the carriage of dangerous cargo – the IMDG Code. Further, Section II of the paper addresses also the carriage of solid bulk cargo (the IMSBC Code) and the most frequent problems and hazards which are associated with the transportation of such cargo. In general, the paper analyses the process of carriage of hazardous cargo {{from the perspective of the}} carrier, and, thus, it may be used as a <b>guide</b> to the <b>carriage</b> of dangerous goods...|$|R
25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to <b>guide</b> the <b>carriage</b> wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|R
60|$|Talking in {{this manner}} about what they had seen, our {{travellers}} went on till they came to Lauterbrunnen. They found a small village here, {{in the midst of}} which was a large and comfortable inn. There were a number of <b>guides</b> and several <b>carriages</b> in the yards of this inn, and many parties of travellers coming and going. The principal attraction of the valley, however, at this part of it, is an immense waterfall, called the Fall of the Staubach, which was to be seen a little beyond the village, up the valley. This {{is one of the most}} remarkable waterfalls in all Switzerland. A large stream comes over the brink of a precipice nearly a thousand feet high, and descends in one smooth and continuous column for some hundreds of feet, when it gradually breaks, and finally comes down upon the rocks below a vast mass of foam and spray.|$|R
