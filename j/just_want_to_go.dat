First, certification requires that the victim be willing to cooperate with a police investigation. Following a police raid, some victims <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home, some victims don’t want to cooperate with police and are deported, and some victims are afraid to testify against vicious traffickers. The application for certification requires support from law enforcement. If the victim is not seen as useful for a case, or if the police don't want to pursue a case, they have no support {{to stay in the}} U.S. and will not be counted as victims of trafficking.|$|E

It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because you <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and have fun with your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E

He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds).

500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, I was ready to go for it.

According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E
