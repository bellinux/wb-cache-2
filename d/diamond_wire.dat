Since most quarries can produce either one, a crushed stone quarry {{can be converted}} to dimension stone production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed.

2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> saws which use less water and energy. Multi-wire saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques. [...] The stone for countertops or vanities is usually granite, but often is marble (especially for vanity tops), and is sometimes limestone or slate. The majority of the stone for this application is produced in Brazil, Italy, and China.|$|E
50|$|Using <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> {{for cutting}} {{does have the}} problem of being less robust (snapping when fatigued, bent, jammed or tangling) than solid cutting blades and {{possibly}} more dangerous because when the wire breaks it can whip. Because of the unique nature of DWC, most saws are expensive and are tailor made to handle <b>Diamond</b> <b>Wire.</b> Commercial saws that utilize solid blades can be augmented with diamond dust blades and thus may be more economical to operate in some areas. Another problem is when the <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> breaks in say, {{the middle of a}} 3000 ft reel leaving two 1500 ft reels of wire, thus requiring up to twice the saw direction change cycles to do the same cut and wearing out the wire saw and remaining <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> quicker. If the <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> breaks more towards an end, these shorter pieces (500 ft or less) of wire are practically unusable and are commonly disposed of due to the hundreds of feet required to thread the saw, leaving little wire to use for process cutting. Because the diamond abrasive is mechanically attached to the wire, the wire loses cutting effectiveness after a few cuts because most of the abrasive is worn off the wire. This means that the last cut may take much longer than the first cut making production timing less predictable. <b>Diamond</b> <b>wire</b> lasts around six cuts then either breaks in several places or is functionally worn out. The longevity greatly depends on the material cut and the number of slices per cut. Quality control of smaller diameter <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> also greatly affects wire life and getting a bad batch is not unknown.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>wire</b> cutting (DWC) is {{the process}} of using wire of various diameters and lengths, {{impregnated}} with diamond dust of various sizes to cut through materials. Because of the hardness of diamonds, this cutting technique can cut through almost any material that is softer than the diamond abrasive. DWC is also practical and less expensive than some other cutting techniques, for example, thin <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> cost around 10-20 cents per foot ($0.7/m) in 2005 for 140 to 500 micrometer diameter wire, to manufacture and sells around $1.25 a foot ($4.10/m) or more, compared to solid diamond impregnated blade cutters costing thousands of dollars. Thus a 1,000 foot (300 m) spool of <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> costs around $200 to manufacture and sells for around $1,250. Selling cost may vary because of wire grade and demand. Other <b>diamond</b> <b>wire</b> cutting can use shaped diamond rings threaded through cables. These larger cables are used to cut concrete and other large projects.|$|E

The anomalous mechanical strength increase is attributed to the fact that the niobium filaments acts as a barrier to copper dislocations...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{workability}} and stone machining has been, {{for the past}} thirty years, {{one of the main}} area of investigation in national and international researches. This study endorses a method for the prediction of stone-cutting tools interaction (mainly <b>diamond</b> <b>wires)</b> combining the micro-hardness and the UPV measurements, that better represent the mechanical, physical and petrographical stone properties.

In previous works, however, criteria based on quantifiable parameters (SSC - Scientific Stone Classification) have been pursued and this led to a scientific correlation with the industrial classification. For each stone the following investigation techniques were performed: petrographic analysis, micro-hardness, Schmidt rebound, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV).
