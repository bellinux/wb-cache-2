5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to <b>implode</b> a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would <b>implode</b> Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to <b>implode</b> along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{detonation}} initiation is a {{topic of}} intense interest to designers of pulse detonation engines. This experimental work {{is the first to}} detonate propane-air mixtures with an <b>imploding</b> detonation wave and to detonate a gas mixture with a non-reflected, <b>imploding</b> shock. In order to do this, a unique device has been developed that is capable of generating an <b>imploding</b> toroidal detonation wave inside of a tube from a single ignition point without any obstruction to the tube flow path. As part of this study, an initiator that creates a large-aspect-ratio planar detonation wave in gas-phase explosive from a single ignition point has also been developed. The effectiveness of our initiation devices has been evaluated. The minimum energy required by the <b>imploding</b> shock for initiation was determined to scale linearly with the induction zone length, indicating the presence of a planar initiation mode. The <b>imploding</b> toroidal detonation initiator was found to be more effective at detonation initiation than the <b>imploding</b> shock initiator, using a comparable energy input to that of current initiator tubes. ...|$|R

Cate travels to a small island located in the Caribbean, where she infiltrates a secret launch facility. Cate discovers that a rocket {{will be sent to}} the space station that afternoon to collect some antidote. Disguised as a H.A.R.M. space agent, Cate boards the rocket and travels to H.A.R.M.'s space station. While she is searching for the antidote, the space station is struck by a meteor shower, causing it to <b>implode.</b> Cate obtains a large antidote sample and uses an escape pod to return to Earth safely.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{his doctorate}} from Caltech, Bradner {{worked at the}} US Naval Ordnance Laboratory where he researched naval mines until 1943. He was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project in 1943 at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, which helped to develop the first atomic bomb. Bradner helped to develop {{a wide range of}} technology needed for the bomb, including research on the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators needed to <b>implode</b> the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering mechanism, and even helped design the new town around the laboratory. He worked closely {{with some of the most}} prominent scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky. He witnessed the Trinity test, the first nuclear weapons test, at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997 E/R Partners {{settled with}} Aetna, {{receiving}} around $300 million. After {{the legal issues}} were settled E/R Partners announced the building would be dismantled. With {{the announcement of the}} demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners. Unable to <b>implode</b> the building because of the building density of the area, E/R Partners began an eighteen-month, $23 million process to dismantle the building. Early in the process, which began in 1998, the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed, but that hope was soon abandoned. The process was finished in 1999. At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building ever razed and is currently the seventh, ranking after the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Singer Building, and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York, the Morrison Hotel in Chicago, and 130 Liberty Street in New York.|$|E

40|$|<b>Imploding</b> {{toroidal}} detonation waves {{were used}} to initiate detonations in propane-air and ethylene-air mixtures inside of a tube. The <b>imploding</b> wave was generated by an initiator consisting of an array of channels filled with acetylene-oxygen gas and ignited with a single spark. The initiator {{was designed as a}} low-drag initiator tube for use with pulse detonation engines. In order to detonate hydrocarbon-air mixtures, the initiator was overfilled so that some acetylene-oxygen spilled into the tube. The overfill amount required to detonate propane-air was less than 2 % of the volume of the 1 -m-long, 76 -mm-diameter tube. The energy necessary to create an implosion strong enough to detonate propane-air mixtures was estimated to be 13 % more than that used by a typical initiator tube, although the initiator was also estimated to use less oxygen. Images and pressure traces show a regular, repeatable <b>imploding</b> wave that generates focal pressures in excess of six times the Chapman-Jouguet pressure. A theoretical analysis of the <b>imploding</b> toroidal wave performed using Whitham’s method was found to agree well with experimental data and showed that, unlike <b>imploding</b> cylindrical and spherical geometries, <b>imploding</b> toroids initially experience a period of diffraction before wave focusing occurs. A non-reacting numerical simulation was used to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data...|$|R

5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to <b>implode</b> a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E

The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth's core with George Gamow.

5|$|Sophie arrives {{while they}} argue and is lured upstairs; the Doctor and Craig follow, {{learning}} from Amy that Craig's building {{has never had}} a second floor. Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some time ago and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since {{he does not want to}} leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves. The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship <b>implode,</b> leaving Craig's undamaged one-story flat below.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens on}} May 1, 2017, when a {{blackout}} occurs in LeMU, its communications system go down, {{and the park}} springs a leak; portions of it get flooded, blocking the exit and trapping the characters inside. Due to water pressure, the park is estimated to <b>implode</b> after 119 hours; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming, as it would crush their lungs. If the player plays as Takeshi, he builds a relationship with Tsugumi, who reveals {{that she and her}} pet hamster Chami are carriers of the Cure virus, which has rewritten their genetic code, and halted their biological aging. She and Takeshi have sex, and she is impregnated. Later, Coco becomes sick. It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU, called IBF, and that LeMU was created by the Leiblich Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF. The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it. Coco was exposed to the virus while visiting her father, an IBF researcher.|$|E

25|$|In a {{two-point}} system, if one detonator fires, one entire hemisphere {{of the pit}} will <b>implode</b> as designed. The high-explosive charge {{surrounding the}} other hemisphere will explode progressively, from the equator toward the opposite pole.

25|$|As a result, {{development}} of Fat Man was given high priority. Chemical explosives {{were used to}} <b>implode</b> a sub-critical sphere of plutonium, thus increasing its density and making it into a critical mass. The difficulties with implosion centered {{on the problem of}} making the chemical explosives deliver a perfectly uniform shock wave upon the plutonium sphere— if it were even slightly asymmetric, the weapon would fizzle. This problem was solved by the use of explosive lenses which would focus the blast waves inside the imploding sphere, akin {{to the way in which}} an optical lens focuses light rays.|$|E
