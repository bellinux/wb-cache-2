2500|$|In {{keeping with}} his {{democratic}} ideals, Mackenzie refused {{the offer of}} a knighthood three times, and was thus {{the only one of}} Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted. [...] He also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title [...] "Right Honourable". His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring Fort Henry as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, [...] "I do. It is five feet, ten inches. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> I built it myself!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 2005 {{birthday}} speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: [...] "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Because</b> if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E

[...] He described his goal {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times:"There is no agony so poignant as the feeling that one has the spark of genius with no opportunity to satisfy that ambition that goes with it. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> I have had my own struggles. [...] The stage and screen have been good to me. [...] I have accumulated all the money I need, for a few years at least, and I am going to devote at least a year of my life to helping young men and women of talent who are denied the chance to display it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 1991, the {{existence}} of the RAM Plan was leaked by Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković and its details were published in the Belgrade weekly Vreme. He says [...] "the line has been clearly established [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> I heard Milošević give the order to Karadžić to get in contact with General Uzelac and to order, following the decisions of the meeting of the military hierarchy, that arms should be distributed and that the TO of Krajina and Bosnia be armed and utilized in the realization of the RAM plan.". He accused the JNA of having [...] "placed itself directly in the service of one side" [...] and requested that Yugoslav Defense Minister Veljko Kadijević and Adžić resign, claiming the two were [...] "waging their own war in Croatia" [...] and that they had arranged a secret arms deal with conservative Soviet Union military leaders during their March 1991 visit to Moscow. Marković pressed Kadijević to comment on the RAM plan. The transcript of the tape leaked said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in New York, Bankhead {{discovered}} that her contest win was fleeting: she was paid $75 for three weeks' work on Who Loved Him Best {{and had only}} a minor part, but she quickly found her niche in New York City. She soon moved into the Algonquin Hotel, incidentally a hotspot for the artistic and literary elite of the era, where she quickly charmed {{her way into the}} famed Algonquin Round Table of the hotel bar. She was dubbed one of the [...] "Four Riders of the Algonquin", consisting of Bankhead, Estelle Winwood, Eva Le Gallienne, and Blyth Daly (all lesbians or bisexual). The Algonquin's wild parties introduced Bankhead to cocaine and marijuana, of which she later remarked, [...] "Cocaine isn't habit-forming and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>because</b> I've been taking it for years." [...] Bankhead did abstain from drinking, but only because she had promised her father that she would stay away from alcohol. At the Algonquin, Bankhead befriended actress Estelle Winwood. She also met Ethel Barrymore, who attempted to persuade her to change her name to Barbara. Bankhead declined, and Vanity Fair later wrote, [...] "she's the only actress {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to be recognized by her first name only." ...|$|E

60|$|That was all. He {{had had no}} time to see me at the poop-rail. It {{was merely}} the day's work, the ship's work, the MAN'S work--all capitals, if you please, in MAN.

60|$|This {{touched my}} heart a little, and brought tears {{out of my}} eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account; {{and this was the}} more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along {{by the side of the}} rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had seen it grow in Africa when I was ashore there.|$|R
