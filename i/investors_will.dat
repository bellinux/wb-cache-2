5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. <b>Investors</b> <b>will</b> still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is satisfied {{without the use}} of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be uncovered. Risk-neutral <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, thereby eliminating the potential for uncovered interest arbitrage profits. Uncovered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the spot exchange rate. The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} {{purchase}} and redeem creation units gives ETFs an arbitrage mechanism intended {{to minimize the}} potential deviation between the market price and the net asset value of ETF shares. Existing ETFs have transparent portfolios, so institutional <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble {{if they wish to}} purchase a creation unit, and the exchange disseminates the updated net asset value of the shares throughout the trading day, typically at 15-second intervals.|$|E
25|$|According {{to modern}} {{portfolio}} theory, rational <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> seek to hold portfolios that are mean/variance efficient (that is, portfolios that offer {{the highest level}} of return per unit of risk). One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular market neutral and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.|$|E
25|$|Private equity {{fundraising}} {{refers to}} the action of private equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds.

25|$|When {{investing}} in a startup, there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate. The first round is called seed round. The seed round generally is when the startup {{is still in the}} very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase. At this level angel <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> be the ones participating. The next round is called Series A. At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or super angel investors. The next rounds are Series B, C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the IPO. Venture capital firms and private equity firms will be participating.|$|E
25|$|A typical cycle {{begins with}} a {{relaxation}} of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions. The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as {{was the case in}} 2003). Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.|$|E

But when risk-free investments are introduced, the investor can choose the portfolio on the CML (which represents the combination of risky and risk-free investments). This can be done with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate of interest (IRF) and the purchase of efficient portfolio P. The portfolio an <b>investor</b> <b>will</b> choose depends on his preference of risk. The portion from IRF to P, is investment in risk-free assets and is called Lending Portfolio. In this portion, the <b>investor</b> <b>will</b> lend a portion at risk-free rate. The portion beyond P is called Borrowing Portfolio, where the investor borrows some funds at risk-free rate to buy more of portfolio P.|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to {{foreign exchange risk}} (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use of}} a forward contract [...] the exchange rate risk is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated forward exchange rate. <b>Investors</b> <b>will</b> be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E
2500|$|MPT {{assumes that}} investors are risk averse, meaning that given two {{portfolios}} that {{offer the same}} expected return, <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> prefer the less risky one. [...] Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns. Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk. The exact trade-off {{will be the same}} for all investors, but different <b>investors</b> <b>will</b> evaluate the trade-off differently based on individual risk aversion characteristics. [...] The implication is that a rational investor will not invest in a portfolio if a second portfolio exists with a more favorable risk-expected return profile – i.e., if for that level of risk an alternative portfolio exists that has better expected returns.|$|E
