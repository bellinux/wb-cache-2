5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though <b>digestibility</b> is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant <b>digestibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the <b>digestibility</b> of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E

5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase <b>digestibility</b> and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to <b>digestibility</b> reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are <b>digestibility</b> reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E

Concentrations of lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids were significantly greater in sunflower silage compared with sorghum silage (p< 0. 05). Silage acid concentration tended to decrease with increasing levels of sorghum in the mixtures. While concentrations of DM, OM and NDF were lower, concentrations of CP and EE were higher in sunflower than sorghum silage (p< 0. 05). Sunflower had greater DM, CP and EE but lower ADF and NDF <b>digestibilities</b> compared with sorghum silage (p< 0. 05).

5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the <b>digestibility</b> and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly <b>digestibility</b> reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E

The potential for enhancement of forage utilization of two high tannin containing tropical browse trees and three legumes {{through the use of a}} digestive modifier called Browse Plus was investigated in this study. The study was carried out in 1995. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the potential for improving <b>digestibilities</b> of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) of two browse tree species, namely; Acacia albida and Colophospermum mopane and three herbaceous legumes, namely; Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Stylosanthes scabra, and Stylosanthes guif/iensis by use of Browse Plus. The legumes were sampled at three’phases of growth in 1994, making a total of nine samples. Forages were obtained from Sanyati, a semi-arid area of Zimbabwe. Total tannin levels in the forage samples were determined using the radial diffusion technique and in WvoDM and CP <b>digestibilities</b> were determined using the mobile nylon bag technique following infusion of 0 - 3 g of Browse Plus Into rumens of each of the three cannulated Holstein steers that were used. Ruminal infusion of Browse Plus enhanced (P 0. 05) between total tannin level, DM and/or CP <b>digestibilities.</b> The results from this study indicated that Browse Plus can improve DM and CP <b>digestibilities</b> of forages containing high tannin levels. This is likely to increase nutrient availability at the level of the small intestines, thereby enhancing utilization of such forages by ruminants. From the results, we recommend that Browse Plus be utilized at an inclusion rate of 2 g per animal per day in order to realize benefits from improved utilization of forages high in tannins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT As ethanol {{production}} is increasing, new processes {{are being developed}} to maximize {{ethanol production}} from corn and to create new, more highly marketable corn distillers dried grains with or without solubles (DDGS or DDG, respectively). This current study evaluated coproducts produced from 2 new modi-fied processes, the enzymatic milling (E-Mill) and the Elusieve process. The E-Mill process subjects the corn kernel to enzymes that hydrolyze starch and help in re-moving germ, pericarp, and endosperm fiber to create a modified higher protein, lower fiber DDG. The Elusieve process involves sieving the finished co-product, DDGS, and then elutriating (air classifying) to remove fiber from the DDGS samples. A precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay was conducted to determine TMEn and amino acid <b>digestibilities</b> of E-Mill DDG and sever-al Elusieve DDGS samples produced using different screen sizes and elutriation air velocities. When com-pared with a conventionally processed DDGS, E-Mill DDG had increased protein (56. 4 vs. 29. 9 %), increased TMEn (3. 656 vs. 3. 299 kcal/g of DM), and higher ami-no acid <b>digestibilities.</b> When DDGS was subjected to various Elusieve processes, the resulting DDGS samples generally had an increased protein content and TMEn. As expected, the higher fiber fractions obtained from the Elusieve process had reduced protein, amino acid concentrations, amino acid <b>digestibilities,</b> and TMEn {{in comparison to the}} lower fiber fractions produced from the Elusieve process.

25|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} seen in cats fed home-made or vegetarian/vegan diets {{produced}} by owners with good intentions, and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages. Because the palatability, <b>digestibility,</b> and safety of these recipes have not been adequately or scientifically tested, {{it is difficult to}} characterize all of these homemade diets. Generally, most formulations contain excessive protein and phosphorus and are deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Also, the energy density of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other nutrients. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more phosphorus than calcium. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in fat or energy usually contain a vegetable oil that cats do not find palatable; therefore, less food is eaten causing a calorie deficiency. Rarely are homemade diets balanced for microminerals or vitamins. Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Dietary fiber is a {{carbohydrate}} that is incompletely {{absorbed in}} humans {{and in some}} animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and <b>digestibility.</b> Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans {{do not have the}} required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis;– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.|$|E

40|$|Two {{identical}} {{experiments were}} carried out to {{study the effects of}} four xylanases from bacterial or fungal origin supplemented to a wheat-based diet, on growth performance of broiler chickens and nutrient <b>digestibilities.</b> Experimental treatments consisted of a control basal diet containing 600 g kg- 1 wheat (C), and the basal diet supplemented with 0. 1 g kg- 1 Grindazyme G from Aspergillus niger (G), 0. 1 g kg- 1 Belfeed B 1100 MP from Bacillus subtilis (B), 0. 1 g kg- 1 Roxazyme G from Trichoderma viride (R), or 0. 0125 g kg- 1 of a xylanase from Aspergillus aculeatus (A). Each experimental diet was given to four groups of six chickens each. Growth performance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded weekly, from 7 to 21 d of age. In the second experiment, a digestion balance trial was performed from 27 to 31 d of age to evaluate the nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) and the <b>digestibilities</b> of nitrogen, crude fat, starch and crude fibre. From 7 to 21 d of age, xylanase supplementation led to increased final body weight and daily weight gain, by 3. 7 and 4. 5 % (P < 0. 05), respectively, without significant difference according to the xylanase origin.

25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as <b>digestibility</b> and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E
