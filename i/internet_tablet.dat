40|$|Abstract Background In {{the last}} 20 years, {{researchers}} have been using computer self-administered questionnaires to gather data {{on a wide range}} of adolescent health related behaviours. More recently, researchers collecting data in schools have started to use smaller hand-held computers for their ease of use and portability. The aim of this study is to describe a new technology with wi-fi enabled hand-held <b>internet</b> <b>tablets</b> and to compare adolescent preferences of laptop computers or hand-held <b>internet</b> <b>tablets</b> in administering a youth health and well-being questionnaire in a school setting. Methods A total of 177 students took part in a pilot study of a national youth health and wellbeing survey. Students were randomly assigned to <b>internet</b> <b>tablets</b> or laptops at the start of the survey and were changed to the alternate mode of administration about half-way through the questionnaire. Students at the end of the questionnaire were asked which of the two modes of administration (1) they preferred, (2) was easier to use, (3) was more private and confidential, and (4) was easier to answer truthfully. Results Many students expressed no preference between laptop computers or <b>internet</b> <b>tablets.</b> However, among the students who expressed a preference between laptop computers or <b>internet</b> <b>tablets,</b> the majority of students found the <b>internet</b> <b>tablets</b> more private and confidential (p Conclusion This study demonstrates that using wi-fi enabled hand-held <b>internet</b> <b>tablets</b> is a feasible methodology for school-based surveys especially when asking about sensitive information. </p...|$|R
