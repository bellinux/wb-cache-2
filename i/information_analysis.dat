5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the <b>Information</b> <b>Analysis</b> Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E

40|$|Remedies for the {{problems}} of bureaucracy take many forms, ranging from simply pruning existing organizations to creating new organi-zations or procedures. One remedy, increasingly popular in recent decades, is better <b>information</b> and <b>analysis</b> for decision-making. Bureaucracies work badly, it is often argued, because inadequate <b>information</b> and <b>analysis</b> are {{brought to bear on}} decisions. Typically the inadequacies are said to arise from the experience of workers within bureaucracies: their <b>information</b> and <b>analysis</b> are said to be anecdotal, fragmentary, and powerfully shaped by the perspective of their particular agency or bureau.

DACS, {{along with the other}} DTIC managed <b>Information</b> <b>Analysis</b> Centers, is collaborating with the TEMS initiative, by transforming to electronic format the documents within the DACS collection (DACS library) that exist currently only in printed format and uploading them to the database created by DTIC to support the TEMS effort. In many cases, the IACs are the single holders of valuable documents developed prior to 2000. This initiative preserves them and expands their outreach. Each IAC is transforming many thousands of documents to PDF format, making them more accessible to the IAC researchers as well as the TEMS. This initiative is ongoing although many IACs are still working on scanning the backlog of documents that existed in printed form only.

As {{demonstrated}} by recent studies, information about whether each communication succeeds is important for precise <b>information</b> flow <b>analysis</b> for concurrent programs. By collecting such information using ideas of our previous type systems for deadlock/livelock-freedom, our type system can perform more precise analysis for certain communication/synchronization patterns (like synchronization using locks) than previous type systems. Our type system treats {{a wide range of}} communication/synchronization primitives in a uniform manner, which enabled development of a clear proof of type soundness and a sound and complete type inference algorithm.
