5|$|A study <b>has</b> <b>found</b> {{a strong}} link between {{participating}} in Scouting and Guiding {{as a young}} person, and having significantly better mental health.

Some field studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> little to no negative effects on colony size or success, while others <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that infected queens produce smaller colony sizes and reduced sexual offspring. Under laboratory conditions, the fungus <b>has</b> been <b>found</b> to affect the survival and efficiency of adult individuals as well as the sperm counts of male offspring.|$|R

5|$|After leaving Elwood's hometown, {{the pair}} {{meet up with}} Gamma's long-time partner C.T. Smith, another wanted powder hunter. Smith has {{infiltrated}} the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which <b>has</b> <b>found</b> a Ring of the Dead. The three challenge the gang's leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays Calder using his mastery of the fictional sword art karin zanjutsu, a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of the Dead, concluding the first arc and volume of the series.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence <b>has</b> <b>found</b> that the pendant {{was made from}} a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It {{is likely that the}} gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

25|$|Many studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> no {{association}} between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that <b>have</b> <b>found</b> an association <b>have</b> <b>found</b> only slight associations with minor malformations like cleft palates. Review studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1-4%), {{which is similar}} to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.|$|R

5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors <b>has</b> <b>found</b> little support among modern historians.|$|E
60|$|On {{the first}} Tuesday of her visit Miss Mackenzie {{had gone with}} her uncle and aunt, and even she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the pace to be very slow, and the whole affair to be very dull. Her uncle had once enlivened the thing by asking her whether she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> any lovers since she went to Littlebath, and this {{question}} had perplexed her very much. She could not say that she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> none, and as she {{was not prepared to}} acknowledge that she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> any, she could only sit still and blush.|$|R

5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing <b>has</b> <b>found</b> the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} studies, it is {{not known}} whether {{increased}} fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness, and there is a similar lack of data for the use of heated humidified air.

However, on the whole most studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> no consistent link between cancer and intelligence.|$|R
