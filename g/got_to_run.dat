25|$|In 1983, Senna {{tested for}} Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and {{presented}} long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker {{than the other}} drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg. Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season. Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) {{so that he would}} have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.|$|E
