25|$|The Registro Civil (Civil Registry) officially records a child's {{identity}} as {{composed of a}} forename (simple or composite) and the two surnames; however, a child can be religiously baptized with several <b>forenames,</b> e.g. Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos. Until the 1960s, it was customary to baptize children with three forenames: {{the first was the}} main and the only one used by the child; if parents agreed, one of the other two {{was the name of the}} day's saint. Nowadays, baptizing with three or more <b>forenames</b> is usually a royal and noble family practice.|$|E
25|$|Lemartin {{was born}} in the commune of Dunes in the Department of Tarn-et-Garonne in south west France. From the moment of his birth he was known as Léon, but his <b>forenames</b> (Théodore, Clovis, Edmond) honoured both his father and both of his grandfathers. When he {{graduated}} in 1902 and required authorisations to work he discovered a mistake on his birth certificate, that his family name of 'Le Martin' had been written 'Lemartin', but he decided that it was easier to adopt the 'new' spelling.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, crosswords {{are usually}} oblong and larger than French ones, 13×21 being a common size. As in France, they usually are not symmetrical; two-letter words are allowed; {{and the number}} of shaded squares is minimized. Nouns (including surnames) and the infinitive or past participle of verbs are allowed, as are abbreviations; in larger crosswords, it is {{customary}} to put {{at the center of the}} grid phrases made of two to four words, or <b>forenames</b> and surnames. A variant of Italian crosswords does not use shaded squares: words are delimited by thickening the grid. Another variant starts with a blank grid: the solver must insert both the answers and the shaded squares, and Across and Down clues are either ordered by row and column or not ordered at all.|$|E

25|$|Charlotte envisaged a joint {{publication}} {{by the three}} sisters. Anne was easily won over to the project, and the work was shared, compared, and edited. Once the poems had been chosen, nineteen for Charlotte and twenty-one each for Anne and Emily, Charlotte went about searching for a publisher. She took advice from William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, directors {{of one of their}} favourite magazines, Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. It is thought, although no documents exist to support the claim, that they advised the girls to contact Aylott & Jones, a small publishing house at 8, Paternoster Row, London, who accepted but rather at the authors' own risk as they felt the commercial risk to the company was too great. The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily), and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon <b>forenames</b> but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls. It was in fact on 18 May 1845 that he took up his duties at Haworth, at the moment when the publication project was well advanced.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the members}} of the Order were {{required}} to be knights, and in practice had higher rank, many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot. As knights they could prefix [...] "Sir" [...] to their <b>forenames,</b> but the form was never used in speech, as they were referred to by their peerage dignities. They were assigned positions in the order of precedence, but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities.|$|E

500|$|Neville Cardus {{was born}} on 3 April 1888 in Rusholme, Manchester. Throughout his {{childhood}} and young adulthood {{he was known as}} [...] "Fred". There has been confusion over his birth date; some sources give it as 2 April 1889, and Cardus himself hosted a dinner party on 2 April 1959 believing this to be his 70th birthday. His birth certificate, however, confirms the earlier date. Neville's mother was Ada Cardus, one of several daughters of Robert and Ann Cardus of 4Summer Place, Rusholme. On 14 July 1888, when the baby was three months old, Ada left her parents' home and married John Frederick Newsome, a blacksmith. Apart from their shared <b>forenames,</b> {{there is no evidence that}} Newsome was Neville's biological father, who is described in Cardus's autobiographical works as a violinist in an orchestra. The Newsome marriage was short-lived, and within a few years Ada and Neville had returned to her parents' home in Summer Place.|$|E
500|$|Offitt, at birth, {{was given}} the <b>forenames</b> Andrew Jackson, which {{according}} to Hay shows that the bearer [...] "is the son of illiterate parents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history". Hay despised President Jackson and Jacksonian democracy, which he deemed corrupt and responsible for {{the continuation of the}} slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. [...] He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners [...] "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw no excuse for violence; as {{the will of the people}} could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election. According to Gale, Hay [...] "never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish"—they are depicted as talkative and easily led (Offitt writes for the Irish Harp), and the reader is told that [...] "there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his ward club as well as to mass".|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the common}} Western naming convention, {{people may have}} one or more <b>{{forename}}s</b> (either given or acquired).
