25|$|NMS Elisabeta {{was a small}} {{protected}} cruiser {{built for}} the Romanian Navy during the 1880s by Armstrong in Britain as Romania lacked the ability to build the ship itself. Serving mainly as a training ship, she represented Romania {{at the opening of}} the Kiel Canal in 1895. She helped protect Romanian interests in Constantinople during the First Balkan War in 1912–1913, but played no significant part in the Second Balkan War and was partially disarmed during World War <b>I.</b> <b>Employed</b> as a barracks ship after the war, the ship was scrapped in 1926.|$|E

While I took the three-line stanza {{as a model}} for my lyric, I found its repetition too monotonous ... Consequently I adopted the style of making a statement, repeating the statement in the second line, and then telling in the third line why the statement was made.|$|E

This {{marks the first time}} when the [...] "classical" [...] design of Islamic rugs was established: The medaillon and corner design (pers.: [...] "Lechek Torūnj") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail <b>I</b> <b>employed</b> the miniature painter Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād, a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century. As some carpets like the Ardabil carpets have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them: ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011 Coulson {{left his}} post, saying {{coverage}} of the phone-hacking scandal was {{making it difficult to}} give his best to the job. In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance. On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he [...] "regretted the furore" [...] that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that [...] "with hindsight" [...] he would not have hired him. Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a [...] "full and frank" [...] apology for hiring him, saying [...] "I am extremely sorry that <b>I</b> <b>employed</b> him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that." [...] The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.|$|E
