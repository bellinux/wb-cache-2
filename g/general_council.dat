Although the <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> {{admitted that the}} existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned, it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same-sex couples (including collateral adoption). It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution, and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means, such as the extension of civil unions.|$|E

50|$|In the Basque Provinces, {{the first}} call ever to the Spanish {{military}} draft was met with frontal opposition of the <b>general</b> <b>councils</b> by November 1877. Tension mounted again between the Basque <b>general</b> (chartered) <b>councils</b> and the Spanish government. Canovas demanded the immediate execution of the order. Provincial councils were then appointed by the Spanish government, all of them answerable to the Spanish governmental deputy in each district (the gobernador civil). In Biscay, the most upfront district to reject {{the abolition of the}} fueros, Canovas ordered an immediate dissolution of the <b>general</b> <b>councils</b> (diputaciones generales). Álava and Gipuzkoa followed suit.|$|R

5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of the}} 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the <b>General</b> <b>Council)</b> reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F.

The issue was decided at the <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the See of Sis {{experienced}} decline and disarray. The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops enhanced the importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a <b>general</b> <b>council</b> of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to reestablish a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443. At that time Etchmiadzin was {{under the control of the}} Turkic Kara Koyunlu, but in 1502, Safavid Iran gained control of parts of Armenia, including Etchmiadzin, and granted the Armenian Church some privileges.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, {{unhappy with}} the {{direction}} of the General Synod and its seminary at Gettysburg, the Ministerium established a new seminary in Philadelphia, and asked Charles Porterfield Krauth to head the seminary (now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia). This was followed, in 1867, with the Ministerium being joined by thirteen other church bodies in a more conservative and confessional organization known as the <b>General</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

Depending on the department, some candidates were supported by the NPA or the MRC.|$|R
