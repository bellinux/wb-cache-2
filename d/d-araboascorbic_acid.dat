50|$|Erythorbic acid (iso{{ascorbic acid}}, <b>D-araboascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> (D-)erythroascorbic acid) is a {{stereoisomer}} of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It is synthesized by a reaction between methyl 2-keto-D-gluconate and sodium methoxide. It {{can also be}} synthesized from sucrose or by strains of Penicillium that have been selected for this feature. It is denoted by E number E315, and is widely used as an antioxidant in processed foods.|$|E
40|$|Formation of carthamin was {{investigated}} in bufferized solution containing precarthamin and oxidizing agents. KMnO 4, H 2 O 2 and HIO 4, were stimulators for carthamin formation. K 2 Cr 2 O 7 Mn 02, Ag 2 O, SeO 2, and CrO 3 on the other hand, showed little or no activity in the catalytic carthamin synthesis. KMnO 4 was very sensitive to precarthamin, while both H 2 O 2 and HIO 4 were insensitive. The optimal pH value for carthamin formation by KMnO 4, was 5. 3 in 50. 0 mM citrate buffer. Antioxidants such as hydroquinone, L-ascorbic acid and <b>D-araboascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> completely inhibited the oxidative conversion of precarthamin to carthamin at a low concentration...|$|E
40|$|Enzymically {{synthesized}} carthamin {{was subjected}} to testing of its stability under various conditions. It easily turned to unknown reddish-yellow or orange-yellow substances in water. This instability was further accelerated {{by the presence of}} a sulfhydryl reagent and or at higher temperature. In a typical result, the rate of the discolouration was calculated to be 21 nmol carthamin h- 1 at 20 °C in water and rose to 44. 0 nmol carthamin h- 1 at 60 °C in water containing 1. 0 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol. Organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and acetone showed little effect on carthamin discolouration, while the stability of carthamin in these solvents was gradually decreased by rising temperature. In various buffers, in the acidic range. carthamin was relatively stable, whereas, it turned unstable on the basic side. All of the thiol reagents tested were unfavourable for retaining stability of carthamin in solutions. 2 -Mercaptoethanol, reduced glutathione and thioglycollic acid exhibited the strongest degrading effect on the pigment. At the 1. 0 mM level, 2 -mercaptoethanol reduced the absorption peak at 517 nm by 0. 02 min- 1, which corresponded to 0. 12 nmol carthamin cm- 3 min- 1 L-Methionine, L-ascorbic and <b>D-araboascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> were found to be strong bathochromic effectors For example, L-methionine rised AA 517 nm up to 0. 01 min- 1, whose value equaled to 0 - 1 nmol carthamin cm- 3 min- 1 at 30 °C Carthamin was absorbed and adsorbed and stabilized by many macro-molecular Substances. Among the compounds tested, cellulose was found to be the most effective stabilizer. The stabilization effect of cellulose was specific for carthamin and the term "SAITO EFFECT" is proposed for it. This effect was reduced by hydrolysis of the carthamin-adsorbed cellulose with Asperqillus cellulase in an incubation syste...|$|R
