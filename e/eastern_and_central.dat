5|$|Expert bakers {{who arrived}} among the {{immigrants}} from <b>Eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> Europe in the 1920s and 30s introduced handmade sourdough breads. From the 1950s, mass-produced bread replaced these loaves and standard, government subsidized loaves known as leḥem aḥid became mostly available until the 1980s, when specialized bakeries again began producing rich sourdough breads in the European tradition, and breads in a Mediterranean style with accents such as olives, cheese, herbs or sun-dried tomatoes. A large variety of breads {{is now available}} from bakeries and cafes.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, 118Category4 hurricanes {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> Pacific basins. Of these, thirteen have attained Category4 status {{on more than one}} occasion, by weakening to a status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale lower than Category4 and later restrengthening into a Category4. Such storms are demarcated by the dates they first attained and the final time they lost the intensity. Only two storms, Hurricane Fico in 1978 and Hurricane Norbert in 1984, reached Category4 status three times or more.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Ireland in {{particular}} has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population. A quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside Ireland. Chinese and Nigerians, along with people from other African countries, have accounted for {{a large proportion of}} the non–European Union migrants to Ireland.

5|$|Category4, {{the second-highest}} {{classification}} on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, {{is used for}} tropical cyclones that have winds of 130–156mph (209–251km/h; 113–136kn). The division of the <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> Pacific basins occurs at 140°W; the eastern Pacific covers area east of 140°W, while the central Pacific extends between 140°W to 180°W. Both basins' division points are at 66°N as a northern point and the equator as the southern point. As of , 118hurricanes have attained Category 4 status in the northeastern Pacific basins.

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} ONUC, the communist Kwilu and Simba rebellions overwhelmed the ANC in <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> Congo. The weak central government was unable to effectively deal with the problem, so President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Prime Minister Adoula and requested Tshombe to replace him. Tshombe arrived in the capital on 24 June and assumed the premiership on 9 July. The insurgencies were successfully quelled {{with the use of}} former gendarmes and mercenaries, but in October 1965 Kasa-Vubu dismissed Tshombe. In November, Colonel Joseph-Desiré Mobutu seized power in a coup and Tshombe returned to exile in Spain. Though he had designs on a return to power, Tshombe was imprisoned in Algeria in 1967 and remained there until his death.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus in {{the wide}} sense, i.e. {{including}} probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found {{on the floor in}} deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into early winter. It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha.|$|E

5|$|Of the 118 Category 4 hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> Pacific basins, 25 have made {{landfall}}. Of them, four made landfall at Category 4 intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as tropical storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than one Category 4 hurricane made landfall, and only during one year – 1992 – did three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures {{rose in the}} mid-continent {{during the}} Middle Archaic, a warming trend known as the Hypsithermal. Grasslands {{expanded}} east, forests became less common, and many Iowa lakes shrank or disappeared. Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy: eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources, and western Iowa towards Plains resources. Excavated sites in <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> Iowa include the Brash Site, the Gast Spring Site, and the Ed’s Meadow Site. Western Iowa sites include the Turin Site, Horizon I of the Cherokee Sewer Site, and the Pony Creek Site.|$|E
5|$|The East Germanic Goths and Gepids, {{who lived}} in {{sedentary}} communities, were the first new arrivals. The Goths dominated Moldavia and Wallachia from the 290s, and parts of Transylvania from the 330s. Their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic Huns in 376. The Huns controlled <b>Eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> Europe from around 400, but their empire disintegrated in 454. Thereafter the regions west of the Carpathian MountainsBanat, Crişana, and Transylvaniaand Oltenia were dominated by the Gepids. Within a century, the lands east of the mountains became important centers of the Antes and Sclavenes. Hydronyms and place names of Slavic origin also prove the one-time presence of Early Slavs in the regions west of the Carpathians.|$|E
