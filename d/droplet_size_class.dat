40|$|ABSTRACT The present {{paper is}} devoted to the {{development}} of an optical diagnostic combining 3 -color Laser-Induced Fluorescence and Phase Doppler Analyser in order to derive the mean droplet temperature per <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> The PDA is a well-established instrument to measure droplet size and velocity and the three-color LIF technique has been recently developed. The application of this technique in sprays requires taking into account the wavelength dependent scattering of the fluorescence signal. A model based on Beer’s extinction was developed and validated. The range of detection of the LIF and PDA techniques, in term of droplet size, is discussed in the light of calculations performed by Generalized Lorentz Mie Theory. The position of the LIF detector is also addressed and two configurations are compared in order to optimize both signal/noise ratio and coincidence rate between LIF and PDA detection. Finally, a demonstration experiment is presented in an ethanol spray injected in an overheated co-flow (air temperature, 100 °C), where temperature measurements per <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} a new optical {{diagnostic}} that aims to perform droplet temperature measurements based on the two-color laser-induced fluores-cence (2 cLIF). The 2 cLIF requires a single tracer, and the fluorescence intensity is collected on two spectral bands. The ratio of both intensities measured {{in the case of}} single monodisperse droplets depends in principle only on the temperature. However, the application in the case of polydispere sprays failed. Indeed, a dependence of the droplet size correlated to the depth of field of the optics, used for fluorescence collection, induces a bias in the ratio value. This work analyses these coupled effects by using combined LIF and Phase Doppler Analyser measurements. This device allows achieving fluorescence ratio measurements per <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> The study is conducted with two different sprays in terms of particles size and density. The use of a third spectral band of detection (3 cLIF) and a long distance microscope leads to correct the size effect and reduce the depth of field effect, respectively. These investigations are then demonstrated by measuring temperatures in an overheated water spray...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Effervescent {{atomization}} is a twin fluid atomization mechanism {{which is}} based on the injection of gas into a liquid stream at an upstream location of the exit nozzle. In this paper, a shadowgraph particle analyzer is used to visualize particle shape and investigate droplet evolution in the spray field. Measurement of droplet Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD), velocity, and centricity has been conducted at several axial and radial locations. The shadowgraphy images reveal non-spherical droplets formed because of aerodynamic forces and droplet collisions. Results also demonstrate that higher numbers of non-spherical droplets are observed at the near nozzle region. It is observed that particle image discretization by the CCD results in considerable error in the centricity measurement. A simulation has been conducted to investigate this error and limitations of the shape measurement method. Also, in this work the spatial structure of the liquid phase velocity field has also been studied using a Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (StereoPIV) technique. The velocity field from StereoPIV measurements is compared with the shadowgraphy velocity results averaged over different droplet size classes. Comparison of the results demonstrates that in the spray far-field region, StereoPIV velocity field measurement is biased toward the velocity of <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> which has the highest probability. 1...|$|E

Our study focuses on the physical character-istics of fog and quantifies the fogwater input to elfin cloud forest using direct eddy covariance net flux measurements during a 43 -day period in 2002.

To allow an optimisation of such processes and to provide data for the validation of numerical calculations, the spray evaporation in a heated turbulent air stream was studied experimentally. The flow configuration was a pipe expansion with an expansion ratio of 3, where heated air entered through an annulus with the hollow cone spray nozzle being mounted in the centre. In the experiments isopropyl alcohol {{was used as a}} liquid because of its high evaporation rate. Measurements were taken for different flow conditions, such as air flow I ate. air temperature, and liquid flow rate in order to provide a set of reliable data. Phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) was applied to obtain the spatial change of the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> spectrum in the flow field and to measure droplet size-velocity correlations. From these local measurements profiles of droplet mean velocities, velocity fluctuations and droplet mean diameters were obtained by averaging over all <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> Moreover. recent extensions of the PDA signal processing allowed for accurate determination of the droplet mass Bur. from which also the global evaporation rates could also be determined. The data for the different flow conditions also include the inlet conditions for air flow and spray (i. e., for all three velocity components), inlet temperature, and wall temperature profiles. The latter were measured using a thermocouple with a special wall sensor. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Application of dispersants aims {{to enhance}} the natural {{dispersion}} process {{in order to reduce}} the size of the slick and the amount of oil at the surface. This study presents an approach for modeling the development of the surface oil slick as a function of the wind speed, oil viscosity, and dispersant application. We modeled the oil slick mass distribution across a transect through the slick over time taking into account the continuous entrainment of oil, resurfacing process of the different oil <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> and horizontal transport. Outcomes show distinctively different oil slick features, depending on how favorable conditions are for dispersion. A large comet-shaped slick is formed in the case of suboptimal dispersion. Optimal dispersion yields a small surface oil slick, with a large mass of oil suspended. The benefit of dispersants is limited to in conditions with suboptimal natural dispersion, with the exception of extremely unfavorable conditions in which the slick size would be increased. The oil slick length, fraction of oil still floating, lifetime of the slick, and wind drift are highly influenced by wind speed and related mixing conditions, and to a lesser extent by oil properties. In the newly defined “Dispersibility Factor” (DF) the oil slick properties and environmental conditions can be combined into one value that correlates with the simulation outcomes and therefore can be used as an indicator of favorability of natural dispersion and likelihood of added value of chemical dispersion...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on studying an isothermal spray to understand the mechanism of interaction between droplets and turbulent air flow, and an evaporative spray to evaluate the group evaporation of droplets as opposed to single droplet evaporation. The thesis describes the development and application of two novel experimental techniques for simultaneous characterization of droplet and gaseous phases in isothermal and evaporative sprays respectively. Both approaches use the out-of-focus imaging technique, Interferometric Laser Imaging for <b>Droplet</b> <b>Sizing</b> (ILIDS), for planar measurements of <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and velocity. The in-focus imaging techniques Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) are respectively combined with ILIDS for simultaneous measurement of gas flow characteristics in an isothermal spray and vapour concentration distribution in an evaporative spray. Combination of {{either of the two}} optical arrangements results in a discrepancy in the location of the centre of a droplet leading to erroneous identification of the droplets in the PIV/PLIF images. This issue has been addressed and a method is proposed to reduce the droplet positioning error. The coupling between the droplet and gas phases in the isothermal spray is explained by evaluating several statistical quantities, the most important being the spatial correlation coefficients of the droplet-gas velocity fluctuations obtained conditional on <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> The effect of anisotropy and gravity on the momentum transfer between the two phases are studied. The gas flow eddy structures are extracted by applying Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on the instantaneous gas velocity data and the selective influence of the large scale eddy structures of the gas phase flow on the droplet-gas flow interaction are examined. In order to study the effect of inter droplet spacing on the droplet evaporation rate, experiments are first performed for the mono-sized droplet stream. The smaller inter droplet spacing of the larger <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> causes the vapour to surround the droplet stream leading to droplet group evaporation. The smaller magnitude of the mean group evaporation number, evaluated at different radial locations in the evaporative acetone spray, suggests the mode of evaporation is in the range of regimes of individual to group evaporation. It is shown that the assumption of uniform droplet spacing in the theoretical expressions for the evaluation of the group evaporation number always leads to overestimation of the group evaporation number.

A one-dimensional model of a rocket combustor, incorporating multiple <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> slurry combustion, secondary atomization, radiation heat transfer, and two-phase slip between slurry droplets and the gas flow was derived and a computer code was written to implement this model. The STANJAN chemical equilibrium solver was coupled with this code to yield gas temperature, density, and composition as functions of axial location. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} model is performing correctly, given current model assumptions. Radiation heat transfer in the combustion chamber is treated as an optically-thick participating media problem requiring a solution of the radiative transfer equation. A cylindrical P sub 1 approximation was employed to yield an analytical expression for chamber-wall heat flux at each axial location. The code exercised {{to determine the effects of}} secondary atomization intensity, defined as the number of secondary drops produced per initial drop, on chamber burnout distance and final Al 2 O 3 agglomerate diameter. These results indicate that only weak secondary atomization is required to significantly reduce these two parameters. Stronger atomization intensities were found to yield decreasing marginal benefits. The experimental apparatus was improved to reduce building vibration effects on the optical system alignment. This was accomplished by mounting the burner and the transmitting/receiving optics on a single frame supported by vibration-isolation legs.

There are several different technologies that are used by researchers to measure <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> from spray nozzles. The objective of these studies was to determine the influence of eight spray adjuvants on the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> spectrum produced by two nozzles in a high-speed wind tunnel when characterized using three different <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> measurement systems. The adjuvant, nozzles, and airspeeds used in these studies are commonly used by aerial applicators.

Schmücke in a rural, forested area in Germany during the Lagrange-type Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia 2010 (HCCT- 2010) cloud experiment. Besides bulk {{collector}}s, a three-stage and a five-stage collector were applied and samples were analysed for inorganic ions (SO 42 −,NO 3 −, NH 4 +, Cl−, Na+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, K+), H 2 O 2 (aq), S(IV), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Campaign volume-weighted mean concentrations were 191, 142, and 39 µmol L− 1 for ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate respectively, between 4 and 27 µmol L− 1 for minor ions, 5. 4 µmol L− 1 for H 2 O 2 (aq), 1. 9 µmol L− 1 for S(IV), and 3. 9 mgC L− 1 for DOC. The concentrations compare well to more recent European cloud water data from similar sites. On a mass basis, organic material (as DOC × 1. 8) contributed 20 – 40 % (event means) to total solute concentrations and {{was found to have}} non-negligible impact on cloud water acidity. Relative standard deviations of major ions were 60 – 66 % for solute concentrations and 52 – 80 % for cloud water loadings (CWLs). The similar variability of solute concentrations and CWLs together with the results of back-trajectory analysis and principal component analysis, suggests that concentrations in incoming air masses (i. e. air mass history), rather than cloud liquid water content (LWC), were the main factor controlling bulk solute concentrations for the cloud studied. Droplet effective radius was found to be a somewhat better predictor for cloud water total ionic content (TIC) than LWC, even though no single explanatory variable can fully describe TIC (or solute concentration) variations in a simple functional relation due to the complex processes involved. Bulk concentrations typically agreed within a factor of 2 with co-located measurements of residual particle concentrations sampled by a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) and analysed by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), with the deviations being mainly caused by systematic differences and limitations of the approaches (such as outgassing of dissolved gases during residual particle sampling). Scavenging efficiencies (SEs) of aerosol constituents were 0. 56 – 0. 94, 0. 79 – 0. 99, 0. 71 – 98, and 0. 67 – 0. 92 for SO 42 −, NO 3 −, NH 4 +, and DOC respectively when calculated as event means with in-cloud data only. SEs estimated using data from an upwind site were substantially different in many cases, revealing the impact of gas-phase uptake (for volatile constituents) and mass losses across Mt. Schmücke likely due to physical processes such as droplet scavenging by trees and/or entrainment. Drop size-resolved cloud water concentrations of major ions SO 42 −, NO 3 −, and NH 4 + revealed two main profiles: decreasing concentrations with increasing <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and “U” shapes. In contrast, profiles of typical coarse particle mode minor ions were often increasing with increasing drop size, highlighting the importance of a species' particle concentration size distribution for the development of size-resolved solute concentration patterns. Concentration differences between <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were typically < 2 for major ions from the three-stage collector and somewhat more pronounced from the five-stage collector, while they were much larger for minor ions. Due to a better separation of droplet populations, the five-stage collector was capable of resolving some features of solute size dependencies not seen in the three-stage data, especially sharp concentration increases (up to a factor of 5 – 10) in the smallest droplets for many solutes...|$|R

40|$|Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SNEDDSs) were {{developed}} using well-defined excipients {{with the objective}} of mimicking digested SNEDDSs without the use of enzymes and in vitro lipolysis models and thereby enabling studies of the morphology and size of nanoemulsions as well as digested nanoemulsions by Cryo-TEM imaging and Dynamic Light Scattering. Four SNEDDSs (I-IV) {{were developed}}. Going from SNEDDS I to IV lipid content and solubility of the model drug cinnarizine decreased, which was also the case for dispersion time and <b>droplet</b> <b>size.</b> <b>Droplet</b> <b>size</b> of all SNEDDS was evaluated at 1 % (w/w) dispersion under different conditions. Cinnarizine incorporation increased the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> of SNEDDSs I and II whereas for SNEDDSs III and IV no difference was observed. At low pH cinnarizine had no effect on <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> probably due to increased aqueous solubility and partitioning into the aqueous phase. Dispersion of the SNEDDSs in Simulated Intestinal Media (SIM) containing bile salts and phospholipids resulted in a decrease in <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> for all SNEDDS, as compared to dispersion in buffer. Increasing the bile salt/phospholipid content in the SIM decreased the <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> further. Mimicked digested SNEDDS with highest lipid content (I and II) formed smaller nanoemulsion <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> upon dispersion in SIM, whereas <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> from III and IV were virtually unchanged by digestion. Increasing the bile acid/phosphatidylcholine content in the SIM generally decreased <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> due to the solubilizing power of the endogenous surfactants. Digestion of SNEDDSs II resulted in formation of vesicles or micelles in fasted and fed state SIM, respectively. The developed and characterized SNEDDS provide for a better knowledge of the colloid phases generated during digestion of SNEDDS and therefore will enable studies that may yield a more detailed understanding of SNEDDS performance...|$|R

In the present study, high-pressure (HP) pasteurisation and sterilisation were evaluated as alternatives for heat preservation of emulsions. HP conditions used were 600 MPa, 5 min, room temperature and 800 MPa, 5 min, 80 °C initial temperature, 115 °C maximum temperature for HP pasteurisation and HP sterilisation respectively. The effects on <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> of these conditions were compared to heat treatments for whey protein isolate (WPI) and soy protein isolate (SPI) emulsions at two pH values and two ionic strengths. For WPI, also the effect of protein in the bulk phase was evaluated. Both HP and heat pasteurisation treatments resulted in similar or slightly decreased average <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> compared to the untreated samples. For neutral SPI emulsions, heat sterilisation increased the average <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> from 1. 6 ¿m to 43. 7 ¿m, while HP sterilisation resulted only in a small increase towards an average <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> of 2. 1 ¿m. The neutral WPI emulsions, except those with a high ionic strength, gave similar results {{with respect to the}} <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> showing that for neutral pH WPI or SPI emulsions HP sterilisation is preferable above heat sterilisation.

40|$|The <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} {{produced by}} the atomization system within a spray d 1 yer is vital in defining the output particle size distribution, which in turn can strongly influence the subsequent flow, dissolution, ingestion or bioavailability of the final product. This thesis explores the capability of a simple atomizing system {{for the production of}} narrow <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distributions within an industrially-relevant spray dryer. The combination of constrained <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution, defined solute concentration and selected processing conditions has been evaluated to determine the influence upon the physicochemical properties of a model active pharmaceutical ingredient, and the dosing characteristics of formulated products. The flow focusing atomizer was demonstrated to be capable of generating distinct <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distributions, and able to produce similar performance in the dynamic environment within a spray dryer. Experiments conducted using the inhaled corticosteroid mometasone furoate indicate that <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> concentration and drying conditions are important in determining the particle size, texture and thermodynamic properties of the output powder. Analysis of formulations containing the flow-focused mometasone furoate particles defined a clear link between the impaction profile in a cascade impactor and <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and spray d 1 ying conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{steady state}} model of {{co-current}} spray evaporator and air (de) humidifier for non-isothermal droplets {{has been developed}} to investigate the effect of polydispersity of <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> on performance. The model is validated by comparison with results of Dickinson and Marshall (1968, AICHE J. 14, 541). It reveals that their ideal assumption of constant droplet temperature leads to significant error when the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution is strongly polydisperse. Numerous simulation cases of the spray evaporator show that the average droplet diameter and <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution of water spray significantly affect {{the change in the}} air properties and the size, velocity and temperature of water droplets. For polydisperse droplets, a narrower <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution (# = 0. 2) shows a more rapid decrease in the diameter of the droplets, thus causing a more rapid temperature decrease and humidity increase of the air than the case of a broader <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution (# = 0. 4) with the same volume-averaged diameter.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of fuel sprays {{generated by a}} rotary atomizer exposed to a cross flow of air. The effects of two variables, the rotational speed and cross-flow velocity, on the <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> were studied. The rotary atomizer was driven at speeds up to 15, 000 rpm with a fuel flow rate of 15 kg/h and cross flow from 10 to 150 m/s. For any given rotational speed, the fuel <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> decreased as the air cross flow increased, reaching an almost constant value of about 8 3 ̆bcm at 150 m/s cross-flow velocity. At cross-flow velocities less than about 50 m/s, the fuel <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> decreased as the rotational speed increased. However, at a cross-flow velocity greater than 100 m/s, the fuel <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> did not changed significantly as the rotational speed increased. Of the two variables studied, each influenced the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> differently in a certain cross-flow velocity region. The rotational speed influenced the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> at relatively low cross-flow velocity. By exceeding a cross-flow velocity of 75 m/s, the dynamic effect of high-speed cross flow became dominant. This effect can be generalized to the Weber number based on the orifice diameter and the non-dimensional <b>droplet</b> <b>size.</b> In this correlation, the following three distinct spray regimes were identified according to the Weber number based on orifice diameter: rotation dominant, intermediate, and cross flow dominant. 9 2012 by Begell House, Inc.
