5|$|Already {{before the}} battle Paskevich {{achieved}} devastating numerical superiority {{on the western}} front. The first Russian line facing Wola had 30,200 soldiers, 144 pieces of artillery and eight mortars; the second line was formed by 39,200 soldiers and 196 pieces of artillery. <b>Facing</b> <b>them</b> were 5,300 infantry, 65 cannons and 1,100 cavalry under Dembiński, with another 4,800 soldiers in reserve.|$|E
5|$|South of the pike, Archer's {{men were}} expecting an easy fight against {{dismounted}} cavalrymen and were astonished {{to recognize the}} black Hardee hats worn by the men <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, {{had a reputation as}} fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland began on 17 September {{in accordance with}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Red Army advanced quickly and met little resistance, as Polish forces <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> were under orders not to engage the Soviets. About 250,000 to 454,700 Polish soldiers and policemen were captured and interned by the Soviet authorities. Some were freed or escaped quickly, but 125,000 were imprisoned in camps run by the NKVD. Of these, 42,400 soldiers, mostly of Ukrainian and White Russian ethnicity serving in the Polish army, who lived in the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, were released in October. The 43,000 soldiers born in western Poland, then under German control, were transferred to the Germans; in turn, the Soviets received 13,575 Polish prisoners from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} the castle, Major Hannibal Bonithon, was invited by Colonel John Arundell to retreat to the {{stronger}} fortress of Pendennis, but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately without putting up resistance. This decision has been put down to a result of war-weariness, {{the large numbers of}} Parliamentary troops <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> and the generous surrender terms on offer, although the 19th-century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies. 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured: the castle's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis, which fell that August.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam and Shelton Benjamin. Both Van Dam and Benjamin started the match with high spots as Benjamin {{performed}} a Sunset Flip Powerbomb, a move in which a wrestler will roll/flip over an elevated opponent <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent down to the floor. The match {{went back and forth}} with action, but in the end Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash on Benjamin and pinned him to win the match and retain his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

5|$|This {{short-sighted}} belief had a detrimental {{impact on}} the tactical effectiveness of RAF Fighter Command until the summer, 1940. With German bombers perceived as the only prey, AOC Fighter Command Hugh Dowding and his planners devised a system and tactics which used unwieldy and tight fighter formations to bring the RAF fighters into combat with bombers, followed by set-piece tactics for the engagement. Because the bomber's return fire was considered so dangerous, fighter pilots were trained to open fire at long range, 300 to 400 yards, then break away without closing to short-range. These tactics, practised so thoroughly over the years, proved totally useless in the battle situation <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> over Britain in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when <b>facing</b> <b>them).</b>|$|E
5|$|In August, {{she began}} a storyline where she acted {{friendly}} and nice, seemingly diminishing her heel characteristics, later shaking {{the hand of}} rival Kaitlyn following a match and teaming with her and Layla on the September 10 episode of Raw. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, Kaitlyn was attacked and injured by a masked figure backstage, and as a result, she was replaced by Eve in a match against Divas Champion Layla, which Eve won. In doing so, {{she became the first}} ever three-time Divas Champion. After Kaitlyn revealed that her attacker was a blonde, Eve accused Phoenix, attacking her on the September 24 episode of Raw. The following week, pending an investigation into Kaitlyn's attack, Eve suspended Phoenix, which was reversed by Booker T. It was later revealed that Kaitlyn was attacked by Aksana on Eve's orders. At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Eve retained the Divas Championship against Layla and Kaitlyn in a triple threat match. Eve then continued her feud with the duo, <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> in tag team matches with various partners, and defeating Kaitlyn at Survivor Series to retain the championship. At , she defeated Naomi to retain the title. After winning a non-title match against Eve, Kaitlyn went on to defeat Eve by disqualification on December 18, with Eve retaining the championship. A rematch occurred on the January 7, 2013, episode of Raw, in which Eve successfully defended the championship after losing the match via count-out. The following week, Eve dropped the Divas Championship to Kaitlyn. Following the loss, Eve immediately quit WWE in storyline. In reality, Torres had asked for her release from the company in December 2012 to focus on her role as an instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered self-defense program.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2013, Cena won {{his second}} Royal Rumble match, and later {{announced}} that he'd pursue the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 29. Cena, along with Ryback and Sheamus, began feuding with The Shield, which {{culminated in a}} six-man tag team match at Elimination Chamber, where The Shield were victorious. On the February 25 episode of Raw, Cena defeated CM Punk to reaffirm his status as number one contender for the Rock's WWE Championship. He then returned to his rivalry with The Rock, with Cena blaming his personal and professional troubles on his loss to The Rock the previous year, {{going so far as}} admitting his own vanity had cost him the match. At WrestleMania 29, Cena defeated Rock in their rematch to win his eleventh WWE Championship and shook hands with Rock as sign of respect. Cena then began a rivalry with Ryback, during which Cena suffered a legitimate achilles tendon injury, while also battling The Shield and <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> in losing efforts. Cena retained his championship against Ryback in a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules as the match ended in a no contest aftet both men were down for a 10 count. Cena then defeated Ryback in a Three Stages of Hell match at Payback. He defeated Mark Henry via submission at Money in the Bank. At SummerSlam, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Daniel Bryan, with Triple H as the special guest referee. The following night on Raw, Cena announced that he would undergo surgery for a triceps tear and would be out for four to six months.|$|E
5|$|The HV Zagreb Corps, {{assigned}} the Storm-1 plan, initially commanded by Major General Ivan Basarac, {{on the left}} flank of the Karlovac Corps, was deployed on three main axes of attacktowards Glina, Petrinja and Hrvatska Kostajnica. It was opposed by the ARSK 39th Banija Corps, headquartered in Glina and commanded by Major General Slobodan Tarbuk. The Zagreb Corps was tasked with bypassing Petrinja to neutralize ARSK artillery and missiles potentially targeting Croatian cities, making a secondary thrust from Sunja towards Hrvatska Kostajnica. Their secondary mission was compromised when a battalion of the special police and the 81st Guards Battalion planned to spearhead the advance were deployed elsewhere forcing modifications to the plan. The Zagreb Corps was composed of 30,000 troops, while the ARSK had 9,000 <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> and about 1,000 ARBiH troops in the Bihać pocket to their rear. At the start of Operation Storm, about 3,500 ARSK troops were {{in contact with the}} ARBiH. HV Bjelovar Corps, on the left flank of the Zagreb Corps, covering the area along the Una River, had a forward command post in Novska. The corps was commanded by Major General Luka Džanko. Opposite the Bjelovar Corps {{was a part of the}} ARSK Banija Corps. The Bjelovar Corps was included in the attack on 2 August and were therefore not issued a separate operations plan.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on a barrage of heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and such tactics very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting over the heads of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry <b>facing</b> <b>them</b> and then, if possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E
