40|$|Information Systems Geographic {{information}} systems {{are used to}} collect, analyze, and present information describing the physical and logical properties of the geographic world. Geographically referenced data is the spatial data that pertain to a location on the earth’s surface. There are four major functional units in a typical geographic {{information systems}} (GIS) : • <b>Data</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Unit.</b> Measurements in GIS are taken by sensors such as cameras and global positioning systems. A manual process is then used for inputting data that cannot easily be processed automatically. The measurements are discretized, for example, by imposing a regular, multidimensional discrete grid over the surface to be measured, allowing points of interest to lie only {{at the intersection of}} the grid lines. In addition to the error imposed by this discretization process, measurement errors also reduce the accuracy of attribute values. The data input therefore needs validation. Various integrity constraints including topological constraints also need to be checked. An example of a topological constraint is “Minneapolis should be inside Minnesota. ” • Data Model. A conceptual data model is a type o...|$|E

40|$|River {{discharge}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in river basins study to forecast drought or flood events from a time-series of stream flow and rainfall runoff. Unfortunately in Malaysia, the existing discharge stations are limited and cater only small parts a basin. This study aims to estimate the discharge in ungauged catchment of Sungai Muar, using HEC-HMS hydrological modelling software. In this study, maps and hydrological data were collected from SRTM and DID, and the data were pre-analyzed for modelling <b>data</b> <b>input.</b> Clark <b>Unit</b> Hydrograph method was used HEC-HMS to simulate the daily stream flow through calibration against available gauged data. From the result obtained, Clark Unit hydrograph method is applicable in estimating flow discharge in ungauged Muar catchment through projection of calibration discharge -simulation based one available data. The results indicate that this hydrological scheme that has been developed is good in simulating hydrograph for low flow period but a little weaker for high flow period as Root Mean Square error value for low flow 11. 46 m 3 /s smaller than high flow simulation 18. 45 m 3 /s. While Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency for the low flow value is 0. 23 bigger than high flow simulation value 0. 017. From these two error analysis, it is proven that low flow simulation is more accurate compare to high flow simulation...|$|R
40|$|Error {{detection}} is {{the detection}} of errors caused by noise or other impairments during the transmission of signal from transmitter to receiver. Logic design errors may occur during simulation and synthesis due to increase in the complexity of CMOS and VLSI circuits. Error detection method can be either systematic or non-systematic. In systematic method, the transmitter sends the original data unit, and a fixed number of check bits or Parity data is been attached to it, which are derived from the same <b>input</b> <b>data</b> <b>unit.</b> In this work, we describe a method of error detection in 4 -bit multiplier with parity predictor circuit in QCA tool. 4 -bit multiplier {{is used as a}} logic in which we detect error according to its <b>input</b> <b>data.</b> The outputs of logic used and the parity predictor are then compared using comparator. If the values do not match, error has occurred. The technique we used is Concurrent error detection using parity predictor circuit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—JavaScript is {{expected}} to be a programming language of even wider use, considering demands for more interactive web/mobile applications and deployment in server-side software. While reliability of JavaScript code will be of more importance, testing techniques for the language remain insufficient, compared to other languages. We propose a technique to automatically generate high-coverage unit tests for JavaScript code. The tech-nique makes use of symbolic execution engine for JavaScript, and symbolic stub/driver generation engine, which injects symbolic variables to system under test. Our methodology allows for automatic generation of <b>input</b> <b>data</b> for <b>unit</b> testing of JavaScript code with high coverage, which ensures quality of target code with reduced effort.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{improving}} word alignment for statistical syntax-based machine translation that employs a syntactically informed alignment model closer to the translation model than commonly-used word alignment models. This leads to extraction of more useful linguistic patterns and improved BLEU scores on translation experiments in Chinese and Arabic. 1 Methods of statistical MT Roughly speaking, there are two paths commonly taken in statistical machine translation (Figure 1). The idealistic path uses an unsupervised learning algorithm such as EM (Demptser et al., 1977) to learn parameters for some proposed translation model from a bitext training corpus, and then directly translates using the weighted model. Some examples of the idealistic approach are the direct IBM word model (Berger et al., 1994; Germann et al., 2001), the phrase-based approach of Marcu and Wong (2002), and the syntax approaches of Wu (1996) and Yamada and Knight (2001). Idealistic approaches are conceptually simple and thus easy to relate to observed phenomena. However, as more parameters {{are added to the}} model the idealistic approach has not scaled well, for it is increasingly difficult to incorporate large amounts of training data efficiently over an increasingly large search space. Additionally, the EM procedure has a tendency to overfit its training <b>data</b> when the <b>input</b> <b>units</b> have varying explanatory powers, such as variable-size phrases or variable-height trees...|$|R
50|$|Structurally, a {{neural network}} has three {{different}} classes of units: <b>input</b> <b>units,</b> hidden units, and output units. An activation pattern is {{presented at the}} <b>input</b> <b>units</b> and then spreads in a forward direction from the <b>input</b> <b>units</b> through one or more layers of hidden units to the output units. The activation coming into one unit from other unit is multiplied by the weights on the links over which it spreads. All incoming activation is then added together and the unit becomes activated only if the incoming result is above the unit’s threshold.|$|R
