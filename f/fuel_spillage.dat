Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated load-carrying capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage</b> upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the seat restraints.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} related to {{potential}} problems associated with the desalination performance of reverse osmosis (RO) units in conditions when the feed may be contaminated with crude oil and <b>fuel</b> oil <b>spillages.</b> The work has involved the examination of the behaviour of polyamide seawater membranes and brackish water membranes with feedwater comprising NaCl/water solutions of 2000 - 35000 mg/l concentration. The effect of a range of contaminants on RO membrane performance was assessed by comparing the water flux and salt rejection of membrane samples before and after their exposure to the oil-based media which comprised crude oil, crude oil/water mixtures, diesel and diesel/water mixtures. Also included in the study were hexane and hexane/water mixtures. The results demonstrated serious degradation of desalination performance after exposure to some, but not all, of the contaminating fluids. The "pure" hydrocarbons, and also when they are in emulsion form with water, cause extremely severe reductions of RO membrane performance as opposed to the situation when they are in solution in the aqueous phase...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{of a set of}} organic gas composition profiles for key source categories is described. This information is used to recompute the organic gas emission inventory for the Los Angeles area. Comparisons are made between the revised emission inventory and ambient concentration measurements in southern California. Respeciation of the organic gas emissions results in large changes in the basinwide emissions estimates for many individual organic species, including l, 3 -butadiene, ethylene glycol, methanol, and cyclohexane. Significant changes are observed in the reactivity of the chemical composition profiles for individual source categories, especially for surface-coating activities and associated thinning solvent use. Receptor-modeling methods are used to identify the relative importance of major sources that contribute to atmospheric organic gas concentrations in southern California. The receptor modeling results indicate a key discrepancy between the emission inventory and ambient data: there is much more unburned gasoline in the atmosphere than is indicated in the emission inventory. These excess unburned gasoline emissions may be coming from a combination of sources including tailpipe emissions, hot-soak evaporative emissions, and <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage...</b>|$|E

Propanol and sand particles ranging from 0. 5 to 5 mm were used as liquid fuel and porous bed, respectively. A video cinematography technique was applied to determine the rate of flame spread and combustion behaviour. Results corresponding to the flame spread over the porous bed for quiescent, assisting and opposing airflow configurations show that the flame spread rate decreases as either the particle size or the depth of porous bed increases. However, the rate of deceleration was found to be more distinct for the flame spread under airflow condition compared to quiescent condition. The flame spread rate for 39. 9 mm bed depth in quiescent condition decreased from 1. 2 m/s to 0. 89 m/s with increasing the particle sizes from 0. 5 to 5 mm.

Results showed that fuel penetration rate was a function of permeability of porous bed and mass of the liquid fuel. The permeability of porous bed and consequently the rate of fuel penetration decreased as either the tortuosity or the specific surface area was increased. Fuel penetration measurement and mathematical results indicated that the rate of fuel penetration is directly proportional to the fuel ratio. The fuel penetration rate was found to be higher for larger fuel ratios compared with that for small ratios.

Most {{previous studies}} also utilize the incident data set from highways or freeways between cities or urbanized regions; few of these studies adopt data from arterial roads and streets in cities. Previous studies [9, 25, 30] revealed that incident location variables significantly influence traffic incident clearance, which imply that locations have different characteristics (such as traffic conditions and geographical attributes) and procedures and training for their local Incident Response Team. Critical analyses of the effects of different incident locations are still limited because of the limited availability of data. The influence of location on traffic incident duration can be further investigated with the support of more detailed data in the future.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into the PAH chemical contamination resulting from the “Erika ” tanker <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage</b> of December 1999 along the French coast of the Bay of Biscay. A qualitative and quantitative assessment was conducted of this contamination in water, suspended particulate matter, sediments, and in intertidal molluscs. The chemical composition of PAHs in pre-spill and post-spill samples was determined and used to distinguish the “Erika’s” fuel {{as the source of}} PAHs in the coastal environment of the Bay of Biscay. Changes in concentrations of PAHs were also assessed. The GC-MS analysis made it possible to identify and quantify parent unsubstituted PAHs, alkyl-substituted PAHs (C-PAH) and sulfur heterocycle unsubstituted and alkyl substituted compounds (SPAH and C-SPAH). The re-sults of this study demonstrated that heavily oil-contaminated shorelines, including beaches, rocky coasts as well as sandy sediments apparently became reservoirs of spilled fuel and these continued to contaminate seawater, suspended particulate matter and mussels with PAHs. These conclusions were borne out by the following observations: (1) the pat-tern changes in PAH composition after the “Erika ” oil spill were consistent in all contaminated compartments (water, suspended particulate matter SPM, intertidal sediments and molluscs), (2) the compositional patterns of PAHs after the “Erika ” oil spill in contaminated water, SPM, intertidal sediments and molluscs constantly included alkyl-substituted phenanthrenes, pyrenes, chrysenes and sulfur heterocycle compounds in higher relative abundances than those in the pre-spill samples of these compartments, (3) the relative abundances of different suites of PAHs at contaminated site...|$|E
40|$|As a prologue to {{a larger}} {{research}} project to improve the durability of Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA), the performance of five HMA wearing courses situated in South Africa's Gauteng Province was assessed in detail. Four sections reported to be performing poorly and one good performing section were investigated. The investigation included a desktop study of as-built documents, traffic records and climate data, as well as non-destructive testing to asses the structural condition of the pavements {{and an array of}} laboratory tests performed on core samples taken from the sections. The findings of the forensic investigation underlined the high demands placed on binder stiffness by the local climate, with pavement temperatures rising to above 50 ºC on more than 160 days per year. Several shortcomings in the rehabilitation design processes for the studied sections were identified. Typically, reliable prediction of future traffic was lacking, and the designs failed to address distress in the existing pavement layers. The investigation provided an indication of the potential value of grading analysis methods, such as the Bailey method, for the improvement of HMA design. Analysis of the binder recovered from field cores showed that premature binder ageing had occurred at three of the five sections. The premature ageing may be related to permeability of the HMA mixes. The core samples taken from intersections showed contamination due to <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage,</b> especially at intersections, resulting in softening of the binder and an increased risk for permanent deformation at these critical locations.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are an important}} group of organic and ubiquitous contaminants with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties, persistent in different ecosystems. Several natural and anthropogenic processes are responsible for PAHs production such as human excretion products, household disposals, fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage,</b> and urban runoff inputs that flush the organics deposited on the ground surface from vehicles or heating systems. The PAHs presence in the discharge sites and adjacent stream waters must be monitored because they can easily pass into the food chain, due to their chemical and physical properties (low hydrosolubility and high hydrophobicity). The aim of this work is the analytical determination of 16 priority EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) PAHs in different samples coming from an Italian landfill applying liquid chromatography with both fluorimetric and UV detection. Different kinds of samples have been analyzed: 10 taken from GroundWater (GW), 2 from Stream Water (SW) and 3 from Leachate (L). Extraction and clean-up of the compounds have been achieved in a single step procedure, using liquid-liquid technique for GW and SW samples and microwave technique for L samples. From the relative concentration ratios of phenanthrene/anthracene and phenanthrene/pyrene in the Leachate samples {{it is possible to}} recognize the origin of PAHs production: pyrolitic origin due to anthropogenic combustion processes, in contrast to petrogenic origin. In order to investigate the concentration trend of PAHs in landfill and adjacent stream waters sampling has been performed along two years (2013 - 2014) in different season periods (spring/summer and autumn/winter). The results showed an increasing trend during the entire period of analysis, in particular concentration values found in the autumn/winter periods are little higher than those found in the spring/summer ones...|$|E
40|$|Guide {{explains}} {{the different types}} of alternative fuel commercial mowers and lists the makes and models of the ones available on the market. Turf grass is a fixture of the American landscape and the American economy. It is the nation's largest irrigated crop, covering more than 40 million acres. Legions of lawnmowers care for this expanse during the growing season-up to year-round in the warmest climates. The annual economic impact of the U. S. turf grass industry has been estimated at more than $ 62 billion. Lawn mowing also contributes to the nation's petroleum consumption and pollutant emissions. Mowers consume 1. 2 billion gallons of gasoline annually, about 1 % of U. S. motor gasoline consumption. Commercial mowing accounts for about 35 % of this total and is the highest-intensity use. Large property owners and mowing companies cut lawns, sports fields, golf courses, parks, roadsides, and other grassy areas for 7 hours per day and consume 900 to 2, 000 gallons of fuel annually depending on climate and length of the growing season. In addition to gasoline, commercial mowing consumes more than 100 million gallons of diesel annually. Alternative fuel mowers are one way to reduce the energy and environmental impacts of commercial lawn mowing. They can reduce petroleum use and emissions compared with gasoline- and diesel-fueled mowers. They may also save on fuel and maintenance costs, extend mower life, reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage</b> and fuel theft, and promote a 'green' image. And on ozone alert days, alternative fuel mowers may not be subject to the operational restrictions that gasoline mowers must abide by. To help inform the commercial mowing industry about product options and potential benefits, Clean Cities produced this guide to alternative fuel commercial lawn equipment. Although the guide's focus is on original equipment manufacturer (OEM) mowers, some mowers can be converted to run on alternative fuels. For more information about propane conversions. This guide may be particularly helpful for organizations that are already using alternative fuels in their vehicles and have an alternative fuel supply or electric charging in place (e. g., golf cart charging stations at most golf courses). On the flip side, experiencing the benefits of using alternative fuels in mowing equipment may encourage organizations to try them in on-road vehicles as well. Whatever the case, alternative fuel commercial lawnmowers are a powerful and cost-effective way to reduce U. S. petroleum dependence and help protect the environment...|$|E
40|$|Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 301 [...] Fuel System Integrity [...] {{was first}} promulgated, {{effective}} 1 January 1968. Its {{purpose was to}} reduce the fatalities, injuries and damage caused by fires occurring in automobile crashes. It was subsequently strengthened (1 September 1975 and again 1 September 1976) and extended to all four wheel vehicles of Gross Vehicle Weight less than 10, 000 pounds (1 September 1976). This paper uses existing police accident and fire department data from a total of 10 states to estimate the effects of FMVSS 301 on the passenger car crash population. Only very limited information on the rates of <b>fuel</b> <b>spillage</b> were found, so the paper concentrates on the rate of fires in crashes involving passenger cars. Some information on fatalities from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) is also used. Post-crash passenger car fires are rare. Reported rates ranged from less than one per thousand crashes up to nearly five per thousand crashes. Rates averaged about two fires per thousand police reported crashes or about three fires per thousand towaway crashes. Fatalities are also quite rare. In 1976, 814 persons were killed in 683 vehicles that caught fire after a crash. In 1977, 982 persons died in 858 such vehicles. Fire department data proved only of supplemental use, because a car fire could not be identified with a crash. Police accident data showed smaller post-crash fire rates with newer model year cars. While {{this is consistent with}} a beneficial effect of FMVSS 301, it could also be caused by an increasing likelihood of fire in a crash for older cars. A linear trend in age for ear fire rates was statistically significant only in the Illinois data. Combining the data from 6 states showed a 16 % reduction in post-crash passenger car fire rates coincident with the first promulgation of the FMVSS 301 in 1968.
