500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. <b>Just</b> <b>continue</b> with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

2500|$|The film trilogy {{would not}} {{directly}} tie into the Stargate SG-1 series. According to Devlin, {{the relationship between}} the movie and the series is [...] "we would <b>just</b> <b>continue</b> the mythology of the movie and finish that out. I think the series could still live on {{at the end of the}} third sequel. So we're going to try to not tread on their stories." [...] Plans for sequels to the original film are unrelated to the development of straight-to-DVD films made as sequels to Stargate SG-1. Using some of Emmerich's notes, Bill McCay wrote a series of five novels, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, which involved the Earth-humans, the locals and the successors of Ra. According to Devlin, he and Emmerich had always planned to do three films with the potential for more, but MGM preferred to play out the television series first.|$|E

[...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...
