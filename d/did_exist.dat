5|$|Before these discoveries, {{a theory}} existed that a Midcontinental seaway {{separated}} {{what is now}} Texas and Oklahoma from more western lands during the Early Permian, isolating Dimetrodon to a small region of North America while a smaller sphenacodontid called Sphenacodon dominated the western area. While this seaway probably <b>did</b> <b>exist,</b> the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited {{and that it was}} not an effective barrier to the distribution of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> {{have fallen into}} disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E
5|$|In March 1993, the AFL and AFLPA {{appeared}} before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC).

The AFL and AFLPA were instructed by the AIRC to attempt negotiations away from the AIRC environment. These negotiations led to the CBA of 1994-1995.|$|E

5|$|Other major streams that drained into Lake Cahuilla were Whitewater River {{from the}} north, and San Felipe Creek and Carrizo Creek from the southwest. More minor {{drainage}} came from Arroyo Salado {{on the western}} shore, and Salt Creek and Mammoth Wash on the eastern shore. Additional unnamed drainages <b>did</b> <b>exist.</b> Drainage from the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these water systems are ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Community {{opposition}} <b>did</b> <b>exist,</b> {{mainly from}} residents of Ahwatukee. While the Maricopa Association of Governments had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway's proposed route, the eight-lane freeway concept ultimately was {{pushed by the}} region's planners to meet the traffic needs at close to the same cost. For most of 2010, the Gila River Indian Community, Maricopa Association of Governments, City of Phoenix, ADOT and others discussed movement of the alignment to tribal land, but no agreements were reached.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma <b>did</b> <b>exist,</b> and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{proboscideans}} lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> {{earlier in the}} Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands {{due to a lack}} of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The first {{numbered}} highway {{along the}} SR85 corridor {{was established in}} 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US80 still exists as Old US80 west of the SR85 alignment. A dirt road between Gila Bend and Ajo <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> at this time, {{but it was not}} a part of the state highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.|$|E
5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps <b>did</b> <b>exist,</b> they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, horses moved {{continually}} between Spain and Portugal, {{and horses}} from the studs of Andalusia {{were used to}} improve the Portuguese cavalry. Portugal's successful restoration war against Spain (1640–1668) was in part based on mounted troops riding war horses of Spanish blood. During the reign of Philip III of Portugal (also Philip IV of Spain), Portuguese horse breeding reached its lowest point. The Spanish passed laws to halt the country's production of cavalry horses, and what stud farms <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> were run in secrecy with horses smuggled or stolen from Spain. These secret farms, however, provided the base for the modern Lusitano. In 1662, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal, the royal dowry included Portugal's Tangier and Bombay garrisons. These garrisons included large groups of Portuguese cavalry, mounted on Iberian horses.|$|E

5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups <b>did</b> <b>exist.</b> By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery <b>did</b> <b>exist</b> and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement <b>did</b> <b>exist,</b> {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
