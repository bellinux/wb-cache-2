40|$|Measures {{that help}} people extend their working years and {{maintain}} their work ability {{have risen to}} the fore in the social welfare and health policies of many European countries. Improving the quality of work life, prolonging work careers, and promoting health at work are all preconditions for achieving a sustainable, stable and productive society, thus furthering {{the objectives of the}} Lisbon Strategy. Prolonging careers and health promotion at workplaces were among the themes discussed at the <b>Informal</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Meeting</b> on Employment, Social Policy and Health during Finland’s EU Presidency in July 2006. The meeting also discussed more generally how to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and ageing, and what measures Member States and the EU should take to develop work life.

40|$|In November 2004 the Dutch Presidency of the EU {{hosted a}} {{successful}} <b>informal</b> <b>ministerial</b> <b>meeting</b> on territorial cohesion. The paper discusses {{the concept of}} territorial cohesion and {{how it could be}} invoked, among others in relation to the Lisbon Strategy of turning Europe into the most competitive region of sustainable growth globally. This is put against the backdrop of previous Dutch involvement in the preparation of the European Spatial Development Perspective. The paper documents the preparation of the meeting and reports on the meeting itself and the conclusions of the Dutch Presidency. The meeting has generated commitment on the part of various Member States holding the EU Presidency (some of them with a long-standing involvement in such issues) between how and 2007 to pursue a common political agenda in so doing, these Member States signal their insistence in taking an active part in the preparation of any future EU territorial cohesion policy.

40|$|After Hungary {{was asked}} {{according}} to the Territorial Agenda (TA), agreed in the <b>informal</b> <b>ministerial</b> <b>meeting</b> under the German Presidency in May 2007, it undertook the responsibility to evaluate and review the TA and update the closely related Territorial States and Perspectives of the European Union (TSP). The TA has a key importance {{due to the fact}} that it had been the first document which identified joint action oriented framework of spatial (territorial) policy on the EU level. The TSP (as basic evidence of the TA) in its more synthetic chapters attempted to identify more integrated territorial structures of the European territory including main geographic dimensions such as north-south and east-west dichotomies, polycentricity and urban-rural patterns. Due to the changes in the driving forces and the new conditions of an enlarged EU, the content and also the function should be revised. The paper is aiming to introduce some of the main findings of the TSP / TA revision process with special reference to the new aspects and trends related to the territorial structures of the Union and the spatial structure of Europe. Finally, some solutions will be introduced which could help to enhance the currently not enough strong territorial approach within TSP and TA...|$|E

2500|$|In its beginnings, {{the council}} {{was a place}} of debate amongst the ministers over {{government}} policy. However, since the formation of real political parties {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, these debates were moved from the council to <b>informal</b> <b>ministerial</b> <b>meetings</b> where government policy could be coordinated – usually held every Wednesday. As a result, the primary function of the council today is to grant royal assent, which is done by the counter-signatures of the sovereign and a minister. Before granting the assent, a relevant minister explains the general aim of the bill brought before the council. According to section 22 of the Danish constitution, a bill must be granted assent within thirty days of its passing by parliament, at the latest, for it to become an Act. In urgent cases, or if a passed law will be in conflict with this time limit if only signed at the next scheduled council meeting, the responsible minister for the law is also allowed to visit the royal institution at a separate meeting ahead of the scheduled council meeting, and ask for royal assent. [...] The sovereign cannot be held responsible for any granted assent.|$|R

40|$|The Bristol Accord, agreed at an EU <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Informal</b> <b>meeting</b> in December 2005, was the UK‟s {{contribution}} to the emerging EU urban agenda. Although nominally positioned within contemporary European debates on sustainable urban development and linked to previous <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Informals</b> on urban policy, {{it can be seen}} {{as an example of the}} „uploading‟ of national policy to the EU policy arena. This paper argues that by drawing too closely on domestic policy agendas (as well as the very wide-ranging nature of the sustainable communities agenda) little has resulted from the Accord. This contrasts with the more sustained legacy of the Leipzig Charter, the 2007 successor agreement to the Bristol Accord which, while also an example of the uploading of national policy, has been more successful in tapping into the mainstream of EU urban policy...|$|R
