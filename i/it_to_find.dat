5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, the {{building}} and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control of the Master Apartments. Horch then closed the Roeriches' museum, forcing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled some aspects of {{the building and}} its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager.|$|E

These scenes are interchanged with scenes from the motion picture, which show Madonna as the movie character Nikki Fynn.

5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} {{wardrobe}} contains the evil George fears, opens <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire {{did not appear}} pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him.

25|$|Above Newhalem, Washington, the Skagit {{flows through}} a deep gorge, {{contrasting}} strongly with the glacial valley below Newhalem. One {{of the several}} theories about this anomaly is that the upper Skagit once drained northward into Canada and the growth and retreat of successive Cordilleran ice flows brought about the reversal. Each advance blocked the river, forcing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new routes to the south, in the process carving deep gorges. Eventually, the Skagit gorge was so deep that even after the Cordilleran ice retreated for good, the river continued flowing south instead of north into Canada.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the rights}} and freedoms that are {{protected}} under the Charter, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence, have their roots {{in a set of}} Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights. Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a contrary law inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all {{of the rights}} that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} USMC Skyknights in Korea was doubled in January 1953 to 24 which {{allowed them to}} {{effectively}} escort B-29 Superfortresses on night bombing missions. On 12 January 1953, an F3D-2 of VMF(N)-513 that was escorting B-29s on a night bombing mission was vectored to a contact and shot down the fourth aircraft by a Skyknight. By {{the end of the}} war, Skyknights had claimed six enemy aircraft (one Polikarpov Po-2, one Yakovlev Yak-15 and four MiG-15s). One aircraft was lost to enemy fire, which was piloted by LTJG Bob Bick and his crewman, Chief Petty Officer Linton Smith, on 2 July 1953. This aircraft was with a detachment from Fleet Composite Squadron FOUR (VC-4) at NAS Atlantic City, and was attached to Marine Fighter Squadron 513 (VMF(N)-513). While the Skyknight lacked the swept wings and high subsonic performance of the MiG-15, its powerful fire control system enabled <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and kill other fighters at night, while most MiG-15s could only be guided by ground-based radar.|$|E
