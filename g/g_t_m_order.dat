40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} {{of the two}} germylene complexes C 12 (THF) GeM(C 0) 5 (M = Mo (1) and W (2)) in zeolite Y was studied with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Ge, Mo, W edge EXAFS) and in situ FTIR/TPD-MS techniques. The molybdenum complex 1 interacts with the framework of Na-Y zeolite at room temperature where decarbonylation occurs to a small extent. The intrazmlite 1 retains the GeMo bond up to about 120 OC. In proton-loaded H-Y zeolite, framework interactions increase with temperature, and the <b>G</b> <b>t</b> <b>M</b> o bond is retained up to about the same temperature. At higher temperatures, the <b>G</b> <b>t</b> <b>M</b> o bond is cleaved and MoCl, and Mo-Mo species are formed in the Na-Y and H-Y forms, respectively. GeCl, fragments attach to both zeolite frameworks. The intrazeolite complex C 12 (THF) GeW(CO) S (2) retains all five carbonyl ligands up to about 100 OC in both Na-Y and the proton form. Significant anchoring through the Ge moiety is observed at room temperature in Na-Y and at about 80 OC in the proton form. The intrazeolite stability of the anchored <b>G</b> <b>t</b> W complex is somewhat {{higher than that of}} the <b>G</b> <b>t</b> <b>M</b> o analog, and WCl, species are formed upon cleavage of the G e W bond at higher temperatures. The anchoring of the C 12 (THF) Ge moiety into Na-Y is believed to be based upon a Na+ [...] C 1 - interaction between Na ions in zeolite coordination sites and the chloride ligands of the precursor. The only gas evolution detected up to about 120 OC is due to partial decarbonylation (CO) and HCl formation in the acid supports. The absence of precursor desorption confirms the effective anchoring of the transition-metal germylene complexes into zeolite cages...|$|R

This depends largely on one’s approach to interpersonal aggregation — that is, summing different goods (or harms) affecting different persons and weighing them against other similarly attained aggregates. I outline four approaches: non-aggregationism (e. g. John Taurek, 1977); asymmetric aggregationism (e. g. Peter Singer in many specialist writings, Alistair Norcross); symmetric aggregationism (e. g.

Molecular cloning of Rdl cDNA from a strain of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, which is highly resistant to dieldrin revealed this mutation (A 296 G) as well as another {{mutation in}} the third transmembrane domain (<b>T</b> 345 <b>M).</b> Wild-type, A 296 <b>G,</b> <b>T</b> 345 <b>M</b> and A 296 <b>G</b> + <b>T</b> 345 <b>M</b> homomultimeric Rdl were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and their sensitivities to fipronil, deltamethrin, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), imidacloprid and spinosad were measured using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Spinosad and DDT had no agonist or antagonist actions on Rdl. However, fipronil, deltamethrin and imidacloprid decreased GABA-evoked currents.

Special attention is given to the application of this new approach to biblical narrative, with an example drawn from a comparison of Isa 36 : 1 - 22 and 2 Kgs 18 : 13 - 37.
