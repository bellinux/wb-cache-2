5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is {{an action}} game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game {{is based on}} the arcade game and film of the same name. The resulting product differed from the arcade version in several aspects, but <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> underlying premise and style.|$|E
5|$|The artist, {{song and}} number {{graphics}} {{as well as}} tables and voting graphics were <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as those used in 2011, with a slight modification to incorporate the 2012 theme art. The lower points (1-7) were highlighted in red squares while the top points (8, 10, 12) were highlighted in orange squares with each square increasing in size {{in relation to the}} point value. Both sets of graphics were designed by London brand design agency Turquoise Branding.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1910, {{the design}} board chose the 30.5cm, to be mounted in four twin turrets on the {{centerline}} of the ship. The armor layout was <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in Seydlitz. In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E
5000|$|The Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale was revised in 1908 {{and again}} in 1911. Simon <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> scale <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after Binet's death {{as a sign of}} respect for one of history's {{greatest}} psychologists and Simon's true idol ...|$|R

5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

5|$|The M2 Light Tank {{led to the}} US M3-series and M5-series light tanks. The Ordnance Department {{viewed the}} M2A4 as a stopgap tank; work to improve it further began in June 1940. The first M3 Stuart tanks began to be {{produced}} in March 1941; the original riveted M3s closely resembled the M2A4, and the two types occasionally served in the same units; the easiest recognition feature is the rear idler wheel. On the M2A4, the idler is raised; on the M3 it trails on the ground, increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle. The M3 retained the same Continental W-670 engine, but incorporated ½-inch thicker (1½ inch total thickness) armor; weight increased to 14 tons. The tank initially <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> 37mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns, but the turret incorporated improvements. Eventually over 4,500 examples of all variants were produced.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E

Other 1980s effects also took place, with Bond smoking low-tar cigarettes and becoming increasingly health conscious.|$|R
