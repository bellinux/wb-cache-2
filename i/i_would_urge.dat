2500|$|Just {{a couple}} of months before ElBaradei took office, the Model Additional Protocol was adopted, [...] {{creating}} a new environment for IAEA verification by giving it greater authority to look for undeclared nuclear activities. When in office, ElBaradei launched a program to establish [...] "integrated safeguards" [...] combining the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguard agreements with the newly adopted Additional Protocol. In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: [...] "One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> therefore, <b>urge</b> all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also <b>urge</b> all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model Additional Protocol and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [...] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol." [...] ElBaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.|$|R

30|$|In {{choosing}} {{this title}} for the section, I am not suggesting that the standard policy prescriptions are without value. It is right that Europe, faced with the twin challenges posed by globalization and technological change, should emphasise education and the up-skilling of the labour force. “Smart growth” makes sense. In the same way, I support calls {{for a return to}} a more redistributive tax and transfer policy. Rises in top income tax rates, or the introduction of a luxury rate of VAT, can contribute to fiscal consolidation and help ensure that the burden of fiscal adjustment can be more fairly shared. But I also believe that we need to look beyond the options currently prominent in public debate, and be willing to “think outside the box”. The proposals sketched in this section may immediately be dismissed as politically infeasible; however, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>urge</b> that they be given serious consideration.|$|R

60|$|The title which heads {{this paper}} is {{intended}} to be Latin, and is modelled on the precedent of the De Amicitia, De Senectute, De Corona, and other time-honoured plagues of our innocent boyhood. It is meant to give dignity and authority to the subject with which it deals, as well as to rouse curiosity in the ingenuous breast of the candid reader, who may perhaps mistake it, at first sight, for negro-English, or for the name of a distinguished Norman family. In anticipation of the possible objection that the word 'Banana' is not strictly classical, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> humbly <b>urge</b> the precept and example of my old friend Horace--enemy I once thought him--who expresses his approbation of those happy innovations whereby Latium was gradually enriched with a copious vocabulary. I maintain that if Banana, bananæ, &c., is not already a Latin noun of the first declension, why then it ought to be, and it shall be in future. Linnæus indeed thought otherwise. He too assigned the plant and fruit to the first declension, but handed it over to none other than our earliest acquaintance in the Latin language, Musa. He called the banana Musa sapientum. What connection he could possibly conceive between that woolly fruit and the daughters of the ægis-bearing Zeus, or why he should consider it a proof of wisdom to eat a particularly indigestible and nightmare-begetting food-stuff, passes my humble comprehension. The muses, so far as I have personally noticed their habits, always greatly prefer the grape to the banana, and wise men shun the one at least as sedulously as they avoid the other.|$|R
40|$|Friedmann (1998), in {{a recent}} {{stocktaking}} article on planning research, identifies what he calls “perhaps the biggest problem ” in theorizing and understanding planning (p. 249). This problem, according to Friedmann, is “our ambivalence about power. ” He rightly argues that this ambivalence exists in all major schools of planning thought from the rational planning paradigm to the knowledge/action theory of planning to the communicative paradigm. Furthermore, Friedmann says, one “of the things <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do differently today ” in thinking about planning is introducing “the inevitable question of power ” (p. 250). Friedmann closes his article by encouraging planning researchers to ponder the question of power with {{a point of departure}} in what is actually happening in city politics and planning, as opposed to what we normatively would like to see happen, the latter being the classic and problematic approach of planning research: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>urge</b> {{those of us who are}} committed to the further development of plan-ning theory to build relations of power—and especially enabling power—into our con-ceptual framework.
