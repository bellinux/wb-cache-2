40|$|Oil and gas platforms, {{refineries}} {{and chemical}} plants need {{to burn off}} the excess gas resulting from pressure variations during production. The failure of flare tips, sometimes with short lifetimes, {{has been a major}} cause for concern in {{the oil and gas industry}} for many years. The aim of this study was to evaluate and improve the performance of flare tips. The study has been approached from two perspectives: (i) material requirements, identifying the most suitable alloys for use in flare tips, and (ii) design optimisation, aimed at the development of a <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> that minimises interaction with flame, therefore giving lower operating temperatures and longer lifetimes. The thesis also includes an Infra-Red (IR) thermal imaging study to establish <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> temperature profiles during flaring. Examination of failed flare tips has provided evidence of intergranular oxidation and stress corrosion cracking as possible failure mechanisms. A study of the effect of thermal shock on the oxidation resistance of alloys 800 H and 625, currently used in flare tips, is presented. The embrittlement of alloy 625 in the range 650 °C to 800 °C has also been investigated. Thermal imaging of three flares in operation has indicated metal temperatures of up to 1000 °C, above levels that can be sustained by alloys currently in use. A Finite Element model of stress distributions based on the temperature profiles has been developed. It was concluded that <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> lifetimes would be limited by a combination of creep and fatigue of the support brackets, and by plastic deformation at the top of the windshield. The model successfully predicted the failure of two flare tips and lead to a timely replacement, resulting in significant financial savings and the prevention of catastrophic failure. Commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software, that solves the Navier-Stokes equation combined with a combustion model, has been used to assess the effect of gas flow rates and wind conditions on combustion behaviour and the resulting operating temperatures of flare tips. The model has been validated with data obtained from thermal imaging studies and shows reasonable agreement, especially at low gas flow rates. As a result, a procedure has been developed to calculate <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> temperature profiles (via CFD) and mechanical integrity (via FE stress analysis) of flare tips, and thus assess suitability of any <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> design prior to manufacture and installation.

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} due to {{malfunctioning}} of the system or failure elsewhere, the burning of the gases had been taking place inside the flare stack {{in the vicinity of}} the SS 310 -Incoloy weld. It is believed that because of this burning, the temperature at this zone of the stack was in excess of 10000 C for a prolonged time (ever since the thermocouple was not functioning). This had promoted microstructural changes in the material as well as intergranular sulphide corrosion cracking leading to the failure. The failure has taken place at the SS 310 -weld interface and in the HAZ of SS 310.

40|$|Numerous {{community}} {{complaints were}} received {{because of what}} nearby residents perceived as excessive noise from BOP's elevated flares. Representatives from the Baytown Olefins Plant met with community residents to better understand their concerns. This qualitative data helped identify the flare noise problem to which BOP responded. BOP continued to solicit community feedback as various flare noise tests were conducted. Of particular concern to the community were low frequency rumbling noise and a higher frequency noise that resembles {{the sound of a}} jet plane passing overhead. To supplement the qualitative data received from the community, quantitative noise data was collected at various flaring conditions, wind conditions, and steam rates. Additional testing was performed to determine optimum steam rates for flaring events that could eliminate smoking and minimize noise. These tests concluded that reducing steam to the flare could reduce flare noise without jeopardizing smokeless operation. High intensity, low frequency rumbling noise (0 - 10 Hz), was rattling the windows and doors in the nearby community. It is typically generated by flame instability. Flame instability was occurring at BOP at fairly low flaring rates, and has been attributed to changes in the flare gas heating value and flare steam rates. Although a moderate amount of center steam lifts the flame {{off the top of the}} <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> and prevents backburning (another source of flare noise), too much center steam makes a flame even less stable. This instability essentially causes a series of small explosions at the <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> that generate low frequency noise. Combustion noise and steam injection noise contributed to the jet engine sound that was objectionable to the community. Steam injection noise increases as the amount of hydrocarbon burned in the flare increases, and noise increases as both hydrocarbon and steam injection increase. Although it is difficult to minimize the hydrocarbon to the flare, the steam to hydrocarbon ratio can be controlled to a minimum amount required for smokeless operation. Additionally, BOP can optimize the use of its two flares to reduce noise...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. A flow {{visualisation}} {{study was}} performed to investigate a periodic flow instability in a bifurcating duct within {{the tip of the}} flares at the Shell refinery in Clyde, NSW, to verify the trigger of a combustion-driven oscillation proposed in Part A of this study, and to identify its features. The model study assessed only the flow instability, uncoupled from the acoustic resonance and the combustion that are also present in the actual flare. Three strong, coupled flow oscillations were found to be present in three regions of the fuel line in the <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> model. A periodic flow separation was found to occur within the contraction at the inlet to the tip, a coupled, periodic flow oscillation was found in the two transverse “cross-over ducts” from the central pipe to the outer annulus and an oscillating flow recirculation was present in the “end-cap” region of the central pipe. The dimensionless frequency of these oscillations in the model was found to match that measured in the full-scale plant for high fuel flow rates. This, and the strength of these flow oscillations, gives confidence that they are integral to the full-scale combustion-driven oscillation and most likely the primary trigger. The evidence indicates that the periodic flow instability is initiated by the separation and roll-up of the annular boundary layer {{at the start of the}} contraction in the fuel section of the <b>flare</b> <b>tip.</b> The separation generates an annular vortex which interacts with the blind-ended pipe downstream, leading to a pressure wave which propagates back upstream, initiating the next separation event and repeating the cycle. The study also investigated flow control devices with a view to finding a practical approach to mitigate the oscillations. The shape of these devices was constrained to allow installation without removing the tip of the flare. This aspect of the study highlighted the strength and nature of the coupled oscillation, since it proved to be very difficult to mitigate the oscillation in this way. An effective configuration is presented, comprising of three individual components, all three of which were found to be necessary to eliminate the oscillation completely. M. Riese, R. M. Kelso, G. J.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the cause of an intermittent combustion-driven oscillation in a full-scale refinery flare is reported. When present, ambient sound pressure levels in excess of 100 dBA are generated. The oscillations began after the replacement of an old <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> with one of a different design which required the use of non-standard components. The assessment included measurements of time resolved and integrated sound pressure in the ambient environment, and pressure in the fuel pipe and the air duct. Images obtained from video recorded from two directions are presented along with relevant process data. A review is also presented of {{the conditions under which}} the oscillations are inhibited or enhanced, and a comparison is made with another flare of similar design which does not exhibit an oscillation. The Strouhal numbers of the potential causes of flow oscillation and the wavelength of acoustic resonances in the supply pipes are calculated. The findings are then compared with related investigations found in the literature. The frequency of the oscillation was found to scale with the speed of sound in the fuel and also to match a resonant frequency within three consecutive segments of the fuel supply pipe. In contrast, the speed of sound in air was constant for all tests, while the frequency varied. This shows that the resonance occurs within the fuel system. The frequency also scales approximately with the fuel flow-rate, although more poorly than with the speed of sound, and matches a vortex shedding deduced to be present within the fuel side of the <b>flare</b> <b>tip.</b> In addition the frequency also matches the fundamental vortex shedding frequency of the air jet emerging from the tip. At the same time the visual appearance of the base of the flame was consistent with the air jet being driven at its fundamental mode. This suggests that the oscillations are caused by the coincidence of several coupling mechanisms. The acoustic resonance in the fuel pipe is deduced to control the frequency of oscillation and to amplify the pressure fluctuations. However the root cause of the oscillation is deduced to be a vortex shedding within the fuel supply. This causes fluctuations in the fuel flow rate which are amplified by the heat release. This creates positive feedback in further amplifying the pressure fluctuations in the fuel jet and the acoustic resonance. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Smoking flares {{have always}} {{represented}} the visible symbols of pollution escaping from the world's oil and petrochemical industries. Only in recent years, however, has the increasing size of such complexes begun to cause acute environmental problems. During normal operations, these valuable off-gases {{ought to be}} conserved, either by gas liquifaction or by re-injection plants but, in an emergency, flares remain necessities as 'plant safety valves'. Essentially, smokeless flaring is an aerodynamic mixing problem. The large volume air requirement for clean combustion has to be induced into the flame by some kind of high pressure gas or steam entrainment system. A novel method of effecting this mixing, rapidly, is to utilise the 'Coanda Effect'. This is the name given to the tendency of a fluid jet to adhere to an adjacent surface, thereby causing enhanced entrainment, actually up to 25 times the original air inflow into the jet. The object {{of this research was}} to study and thus improve the performance of one design of Coanda, external surface, steam flare, developed and marketed by BP under the trade name Stedair. The investigation of this flare system was conducted in two parts; physical modelling of the entrainment at the <b>flare</b> <b>tip,</b> followed on by confirmatory measurements, on a 76 mm pilot scale, propylene doped, methane-steam flare, A slice (two-dimensional) water model of a Stedair <b>flare</b> <b>tip</b> was constructed, to examine the effectiveness of Coanda surface geometry, as an entrainer and mixer. The neutralisation reaction between solutions of HCl and NaOH was used to imitate the combustion reactions between oxygen and hydrocarbons, the neutralisation being made visible by the use of phenolphalcin as an indicator. Adjustment of the concentrations cuid flows simulates fuel stoichiemetry and excess air requirements, producing a 'flare envelope' corresponding to the 'mixed is burnt criterion. The second phase of the investigation consisted of a series of combustion tests on the largest (76 mm) Stedair steam flare that could b 6 safely operated within a high ceiling (7. 6 m) laboratory. Temperature and CO profiles within the flame were measured on 3 flare heads, with 4 slot widths/head and at 3 steam flows/slot width, the gas flow being kept constant. Smoke Points, Blow-off and Coanda Breakaway Points were also measured at varying gas flows. The Coanda principle is inherently such an excellent entrainment device that combustion on these flare tips is nearly always good, provided that the jet slot width remains uniform. Whilst noise and radiation levels can only be measured on real flares, combustion quality and entrainment rates are best measured on slice water models of such flares. The experimental flare built by the author demonstrated this point very well. The pulsations and oscillations of this turbulent jet, even in the wind-free laboratory environment made obtaining consistent measurements very difficult. A Coanda flare behaves like an enclosed rather than a free jet, thus the similarity criteria developed by Craya and Curtet can be applied and when it is, Jenkins and Coworkers have shown that, water model results do correspond to those measured on real flare trials...|$|E

40|$|CD-AFMs (critical {{dimension}} atomic force microscopes) are instruments with servo-control of the tip in {{more than}} one direction. With appropriately “boot-shaped ” or <b>flared</b> <b>tips,</b> such instruments can image vertical or even undercut features. As with any AFM, the image is a dilation of the sample shape with the tip shape. Accurate extraction of the CD requires a correction for the tip effect. Analytical methods to correct images for the tip shape have been available for some time for the traditional (vertical feedback only) AFMs, but were until recently unavailable for instruments with multi-dimensional feedback. Dahlen et al. [J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 23, pp. 2297 - 2303, (2005) ] recently introduced a swept-volume approach, implemented for 2 -dimensional (2 D) feedback.

5000|$|The Kilij, as a {{specific}} type of sabre associated with the Ottoman Turks and the Mamluks of Egypt, was recognisable by the late 15th century. The oldest surviving examples sport a long blade curving slightly from the hilt and more strongly in the distal half.

This distinctive <b>flaring</b> <b>tip</b> is called a [...] "yalman" [...] (false edge) and it greatly adds to the cutting power of the sword. Ottoman sabres of the next couple of centuries were often of the Selchuk variety, though the native kilij form was also found; Iranian blades (that did not have the yalman) were fitted with Ottoman hilts. These hilts normally had slightly longer quillons to the guard, which was usually of brass or silver, and sported a rounded termination to the grips, usually made of horn, unlike that seen on Iranian swords (Iranian swords usually had iron guards and the grip terminated in a hook-shape often with a metal pommel sheathing). The finest mechanical damascus and wootz steel were often used in making of these swords. In the classical period of the Ottoman Empire, Bursa, Damascus and the Derbent regions became the most famous swordsmithing centers of the empire. Turkish blades became a major export item to Europe and Asia.|$|R

The anal fasciole shows only traces of the finer spiral threads.The transverse sculpture consists of nine stout short waves, or rounded ribs, with narrower interspaces, beginning in front of the fasciole and becoming obsolete in front of the whorl toward the canal. It also shows rather coarse, strong, and somewhat irregular incremental lines. And where the fasciole borders on the suture, the arched incremental lines are crowded into a series of not very regular plications, which form a band or series in front of the suture. The fasciole is slightly excavated. The surface of the shell carries a yellowish opaque thin epidermis. The whorls are moderately rounded. The base of the shell is subconical. The siphonalcanal is short, rather large, slightly recurved and <b>flaring</b> at the <b>tip.</b> The anal sinus is rounded and rather shallow. The outer lip is convexly arched, sharp-edged, with or without a rib behind it, according to the stage of growth, with no varix. The aperture is narrow, long lirate in the throat. The columella is straight, near its junction with the body having two strong plaits, which continue internally to the apex of the shell. The inner lip has a coat of callus, somewhat reflected anteriorly in the adult.|$|R
