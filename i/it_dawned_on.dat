[...] At the time, {{he thought to}} himself, [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities".

500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> me that the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and I want to keep it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody would ever get [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> her that life {{would never be the same}} again, and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote.

2500|$|One unifying theme, on the {{striking}} formal similarities of analysis in seemingly diverse fields, occurred {{only in the}} course of writing on them—from consumer's behavior and production economics of the firm to international trade, business cycles, and income analysis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> the author that he was prodigal [...] "in proving essentially the same theorems" [...] over and over. [...] His failure of initial intuition, so he suggests, might be less surprising in light of the few economic writings then extant concerned with formulating meaningful theorems – hypotheses about empirical data—that could conceivably be refuted by empirical data (pp.3–5).|$|E
2500|$|His second novel, Shampoo Planet, was {{published}} by Pocket Books in 1992. It focused on the generation after Generation X, the group called [...] "Global Teens" [...] in his first novel and now generally labeled Generation Y. Coupland permanently moved back to Vancouver soon after the novel {{was published}}. He had spent his [...] "twenties scouring the globe thinking {{there had to be}} a better city out there, until <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> [...] that Vancouver is the best one going". He wrote a collection of small books, which together were compiled, after the advice of his publisher, into the book Life After God. This collection of short stories, with its focus on spirituality, initially provoked polarized reaction before eventually revealing itself as a bellwether text for the avant-garde sensibility identified by Ferdinand Mount as [...] "Christian post-Christian".|$|E

2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conlon {{grew up in}} {{a family}} of five {{children}} on Cherry Street in Douglaston, Queens, New York City. His mother, Angeline L. Conlon, was a freelance writer. His father was an assistant to the New York City Commissioner of Labor in the Robert F. Wagner administration. His siblings were not musically inclined, nor were his parents. When he was eleven, he went to a production of La traviata by an amateur company founded by the mother of a friend (Edith Mugdan, the mother of the young Conlon's best friend, Walter Mugdan, and the founder of the North Shore Opera [...] ). He asked for music lessons and became a treble (boy soprano) in a children's chorus in an opera company in Queens. He dreamed about being a tenor, then a baritone, and even wanted to sing the role of Carmen at one point. Finally <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> him {{that the only way to}} do everything in opera was to become an operatic conductor.|$|E

[...] In an attempt to become more popular and make friends, in 1962, Millington and her sister Jean wrote their first song [...] "Angel in White", followed by [...] "Miss Wallflower '62", which they sang with two other girls on their ukuleles at their junior high school variety show. Millington recalled that afterwards, [...] "Kids started coming up to us and telling us they liked it. So <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> us this {{was a way to}} make friends." [...] In 1962, Millington and her sister Jean began to sing folk songs together as an acoustic duo at hootenannies and similar events, including the songs of Peter, Paul and Mary and other artists featured on the television program Hootenanny.|$|E

2500|$|Ali Osman {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Ali, a Turkish Cypriot, was originally intended to be named Chris. His name was changed to Ali when <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> Holland that he had given a Christian name to a Muslim. [...] Ali was a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. [...] For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in {{the original}} character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their contacts to relay information about their origins and lifestyles and were then able to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E
