500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a meeting}} with John Houseman, Reeve was told, [...] "Mr. Reeve. It is terribly <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> become a serious {{classical}} actor. Unless, of course, they offer you a shitload of money to do something else." [...] Houseman then offered him the chance to leave school and join the Acting Company, among performers such as Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, and David Ogden Stiers. Reeve declined, as {{he had not yet}} received his bachelor's degree from Juilliard.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "independent school" [...] {{system has}} divided {{public opinion in}} Sweden. During the 2010 {{election}} neither political block suggested abandoning the program. A poll conducted in 2011 by Synovate found that Swedes who want to ban companies from operating schools for profit outnumbered those that don't. The Swedish model has been put forward as a possible model for similar solutions in both the United Kingdom and the United States, where Per Unckel, County Governor of Stockholm and former Conservative Minister of Education, in 2009 summarised {{the advantages of the}} Swedish system in an opinion piece produced by the Libertarian think tank Pacific Research Institute: [...] "Education is so <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can’t just leave it to one producer. Because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes".|$|E
2500|$|Glau {{trained with}} stunt {{coordinator}} Joel Kramer {{to prepare for}} the physical demands of her role. In learning martial arts for Serenity, Glau used her training in ballet to learn fight scenes by counts, as if they were choreographies. About bringing the practice to Terminator, Glau said, [...] "When you're working with a stunt guy ... and you need to anticipate every swing he's going to take at you ... it's <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know exactly the timing that it's all going to play out." [...] Training focused heavily on the destruction of breakable set pieces, safety in hand-to-hand fights and the use of a variety of firearms. Glau was challenged during fight scenes by not being able to move or act humanly by things such as pushing her hair out of her face. Glau modeled Cameron's walk after that of a dressage horse for its precision.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{development}} on the game's user interface began using the principle that the game needed to be both accessible and charming, being able to draw in new players and to be clear {{how to play the}} game. Unity is used as the game engine in the interest of speed and to make the game run smoother since the server is where all of the rules exist and calculations happen then the server tells the client what happened. Dodds stated that [...] "it's <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have {{to spend a lot of}} time understanding the rules to play the game, the depth grows as you go." [...] Gameplay elements such as pre-made decks for each hero, deck building helps, and visual cues on which cards could be played were used to guide new players. Card text was written in a way so that a new player should be able to immediately understand the effects.|$|E
2500|$|Dick's wealth {{allowed him}} to provide his own funding, and gave him an {{independence}} the other photographers lacked. [...] Stryker attempted to provide some guidance {{for the kind of}} photographs he was looking for, writing to Dick, [...] "It is terribly <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> in some way try to show the town against this background of waste piles and coal tipples. In other words, it is a coal town and your pictures must tell it." [...] Instead, many of Dick's photographs are interiors, bars, and images of ordinary life. [...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
