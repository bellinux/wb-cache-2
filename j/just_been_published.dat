2500|$|However, {{others have}} criticized Sowell for drawing causal inferences without a {{coherent}} methodology, and for commenting on subjects {{in which he}} has no training or formal background, a criticism Sowell has issued towards others. In 1981, The New York Times noted that two of Sowell's books, Markets and Minorities and Ethnic America, [...] "have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published,</b> to much praise from fellow conservatives and a lot of criticism, some of it bitter, from fellow blacks and from liberal intellectuals." [...] Bernadette Chachere, an economist at Hampton University, criticized Markets and Minorities for ignoring past economic research on income disparities between races: [...] "To cite one article published in 1973, after controlling for age, region of residence, parents' income, father's occupation and education, place where raised, number of siblings, health, local labor, market conditions, geographic mobility, and seasonal employment, there still remained a 70% difference in the earnings of whites and nonwhites unexplained... the lack of such a [...] review does preclude Sowell's claim to a monopoly on 'rigorous' analysis.

2500|$|In July 1825 Scott {{acquired}} {{a copy of}} the Diary of Samuel Pepys, which had <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published</b> for the first time, and according to his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart, [...] "I never observed him more delighted with any book whatsoever". [...] Later that year he read a manuscript copy of Byron's 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer. [...] Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry. [...] Only two days later he noted doubts as to the stability of the publisher Archibald Constable & Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large financial interest in the firm. [...] His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing James Ballantyne & Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him. [...] Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than £125,000. [...] He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the Journal records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including Woodstock, The Surgeon's Daughter, The Fair Maid of Perth, Anne of Geierstein, Count Robert of Paris, The Siege of Malta, Bizarro, The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and Tales of a Grandfather. [...] Other disasters are recorded in the Journal, such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers. [...] In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831. [...] In October 1831 he again resumed the Journal, having been offered £1000 or £1500 by his publisher Robert Cadell for some record of his forthcoming voyage to Malta and Italy. [...] He finally abandoned work on it in Naples in April 1832, the last entry ending {{in the middle of a}} sentence.|$|E

Which is a question I have for these ten years been endeavouring to get the British public to consider--vainly enough hitherto; and will not at present add to my own many words on the matter. But a book has <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published</b> by a British officer, who, {{if he had not}} been otherwise and more actively employed, could not only have written all my books about landscape and picture, but is very singularly also of one mind with me, (God knows of how few Englishmen I can now say so,) on matters regarding the Queen's safety, and the Nation's honour. Of whose book ("Far out: Rovings retold"), since various passages will be given in my subsequent terminal notes, I will content myself with quoting for the end of my Preface, the memorable words which Colonel Butler himself quotes, as spoken to the British Parliament by its last Conservative leader, a British officer who had also served with honour and success.|$|E
6000|$|A new Poem has <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>{{published}}</b> by {{the above}} Nobleman, and the 'Morning Chronicle' of to-day has favoured its readers with his Lordship's Dedication {{of it to}} THOMAS MOORE, Esq., in what that paper calls [...] "an elegant eulogium."

But our purpose is not with the Dedication, nor the main Poem, 'The Corsair', but {{with one of the}} pieces called Poems, published {{at the end of the}} 'Corsair'. Nearly two years ago (in March, 1812), when the REGENT was attacked with a bitterness and rancour that disgusted the whole country; when attempts were made day after day to wound every feeling of the heart; there appeared in the 'Morning Chronicle' an anonymous 'Address to a Young Lady weeping', upon which we remarked at the time ('Courier of March' 7, 1812), considering it as tending to make the Princess CHARLOTTE of WALES view the PRINCE REGENT her father as an object of suspicion and disgrace. Few of our readers have forgotten the disgust which this address excited. The author of it, however, unwilling that it should sleep in the oblivion to which it had been consigned with the other trash of that day, has republished it, and, placed the first of what are called Poems at the end of this newly published work the Corsair, we find this very address: ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{now going}} to ask your {{permission}} to name the masters whom I {{think it would be}} well if we could agree, in our Schools of Art in England, to consider our leaders. The first and chief I will not myself presume to name; he shall be distinguished for you by the authority of those two great painters of whom we have just been speaking--Reynolds and Velasquez. You may remember that in your Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition the most impressive things were the works of those two men-- nothing told upon the eye so much; no other pictures retained it with such a persistent power. Now, I have the testimony, first of Reynolds to Velasquez, and then of Velasquez to the man whom I want you to take as the master of all your English schools. The testimony of Reynolds to Velasquez is very striking. I take it from some fragments which have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published</b> by Mr. William Cotton--precious fragments--of Reynolds' diaries, which I chanced upon luckily as I was coming down here: for I was going to take Velasquez' testimony alone, and then fell upon this testimony of Reynolds to Velasquez, written most fortunately in Reynolds' own hand-you may see the manuscript. [...] "What we are all," [...] said Reynolds, [...] "attempting to do with great labor, Velasquez does at once." [...] Just think what is implied when a man of the enormous power and facility that Reynolds had, says he was [...] "trying to do with great labor" [...] what Velasquez [...] "did at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh that mine adversary {{had written}} a book!" [...] Who does not {{understand}} the truth of these words! It is always out of a man's mouth that you may most surely condemn him. Cicero wrote many books, and all about himself. He has been honored very highly. Middleton, {{in the preface to}} his own biography, which, with all its charms, has become a bye-word for eulogy, quotes the opinion of Erasmus, who tells us that he loves the writings of the man [...] "not only for the divine felicity of his style, but for the sanctity of his heart and morals." [...] This was the effect left on the mind of an accurate thinker and most just man. But then also has Cicero been spoken of with the bitterest scorn. From Dio Cassius, who wrote two hundred and twenty years after Christ, down to Mr. Froude, whose Cæsar has <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published,</b> he has had such hard things said of him by men who have judged him out of his own mouth, that the reader does not know how to reconcile what he now reads with the opinion of men of letters who lived and wrote in the century next after his death--with the testimony of such a man as Erasmus, and with the hearty praises of his biographer, Middleton. The sanctity of his heart and morals! It was thus that Erasmus was struck in reading his works. It is a feeling of that kind, I profess, that has induced me to take this work in hand--a feeling produced altogether by the study of his own words. It has seemed to be that he has loved men so well, has been so anxious for the true, has been so capable of honesty when dishonesty was common among all around him, has been so jealous in the cause of good government, has been so hopeful when there has been but little ground for hope, as to have deserved a reputation for sanctity of heart and morals.|$|E
6000|$|There {{have been}} {{included}} in this volume photographic reproductions of certain pages of the original manuscript of Doctor Grimshawe, selected at random, upon which those ingenious persons whose convictions are in advance of their instruction are cordially invited to try their teeth; for it has been maintained that Mr. Hawthorne's handwriting was singularly legible. The present writer possesses specimens of Mr. Hawthorne's chirography at various ages, from boyhood until a day or two before his death. Like the handwriting of most men, it was at its best between the twenty-fifth and the fortieth years of life; and in some instances it is a remarkably beautiful type of penmanship. But as time went on it deteriorated, and, while of course retaining its elementary characteristics, it became less and less easy to read, especially in those writings which were intended solely for his own perusal. As with other men of sensitive organization, the mood of the hour, a good or a bad pen, a ready or an obstructed flow of thought, would all be reflected {{in the formation of the}} written letters and words. In the manuscript of the fragmentary sketch which has <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>published</b> in a magazine, which is written in an ordinary commonplace- book, with ruled pages, and in which the author had not yet become possessed with the spirit of the story and characters, the handwriting is deliberate and clear. In the manuscript of [...] "Doctor Grimshawe's Secret," [...] on the other hand, which was written almost immediately after the other, but on unruled paper, and when the writer's imagination was warm and eager, the chirography is for the most part a compact mass of minute cramped hieroglyphics, hardly to be deciphered save by flashes of inspiration. The matter is not, in itself, of importance, and is alluded to here only as having been brought forward in connection with other insinuations, with the notice of which it seems unnecessary to soil these pages. Indeed, were I otherwise disposed, Doctor Grimshawe himself would take the words out of my mouth; his speech is far more poignant and eloquent than mine. In dismissing this episode, I will take the liberty to observe that it appears to indicate a spirit in our age less sceptical than is commonly supposed,--belief in miracles being still possible, provided only the miracle be a scandalous one.|$|E
