Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or <b>indirectly.</b> These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} <b>indirectly</b> through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the planet is predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President.
