The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E
50|$|New Urbanism {{has drawn}} both praise and {{criticism}} {{from all parts}} of the political spectrum.

5|$|Born in a {{small town}} in the state of Veracruz, Mart√≠nez P√©rez left her {{hometown}} to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of censorship that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Mart√≠nez P√©rez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Mart√≠nez P√©rez faced several challenges of censorship by the political establishment for her direct reporting, and particularly <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse of authority, and for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, ƒê·ªãnh moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia ƒê·ªãnh as the provincial commander. ƒê·ªãnh grew up to lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, ƒê·ªãnh organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined ƒê·ªãnh's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. ƒê·ªãnh built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led T·ª± ƒê·ª©c to grant ƒê·ªãnh command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. ƒê·ªãnh's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Esp√©rance in December 1861.|$|E
