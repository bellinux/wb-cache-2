Dormant sprays of H₂CN₂ applied at 2. 5 and 5. 0 % (v/v) concentrations hastened budbreak by at least 16 days with subsequent advancement of fruit maturity by 5 to 10 days. A 5. 0 % (v/v) <b>dormant</b> <b>application</b> of H₂CN₂ to whole vine, buds only or pruning cuts only advanced budbreak by at least 16 days and advanced fruit maturity by 1 to 5 days, regardless of application site.

40|$|Presented {{below is}} a {{recommended}} approach for monitoring waterbodies for pesticide-caused aquatic life toxicity. It {{is based on the}} experience of the authors in conducting and reviewing the aquatic life toxicity studies of others over the past 10 years. Dormant Pesticide Applications One of the issues of concern regarding pesticide runoff monitoring is the application of dormant-spray pesticides to orchards just prior to major stormwater runoff events. In order to adequately monitor for potential discharges from dormant-spray applications, there is need to develop a technically valid approach for determining worst-case water quality objective violations due to the use of these pesticides. Agricultural interests will likely be able to control stormwater runoff of these pesticides during low to moderate runoff events. However, as Lee (2005 a) indicated in his comments on the draft DPR-proposed regulations governing <b>dormant</b> <b>application</b> of the OP pesticides, there will be runoff events associated with large storms when violations of the pesticide TMDL goal will likely occur following application. It is under such conditions that there is the greatest potential for high concentrations of OP and other pesticides to be present i...|$|E
30|$|Seedlings {{greater than}} 15  mm root collar {{diameter}} had greater than 0.5 {{probability of survival}} after the first growing season in the HB treatment, regardless of the season of treatment application, and seedlings across all sizes had greater than 0.6 probability of survival in the LB treatment after the first growing season. The growing season treatment application resulted in additional mortality during the second growing season, across all seedling size classes, which was not observed in the <b>dormant</b> season <b>application.</b> Burning reduced root collar growth through two growing seasons, likely due to needle mortality and the subsequent prioritization of growth to needle production rather than to root or stem growth.|$|R

It {{is a serious}} production problem for alfalfa growers in the southern Great Plains region because of extended germination and impact on forage quality and yields. Glyphosate has been used extensively to control Palmer amaranth but control has become difficult. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate various herbicide treatments for Palmer amaranth control in established alfalfa, (2) confirm the presence and scope of glyphosate-resistance in common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth populations in eastern Kansas, and (3) to characterize glyphosate-resistance in two Palmer amaranth populations from south central Kansas. Residual Palmer amaranth control in alfalfa varied among herbicide treatments. The best late season Palmer amaranth control was accomplished with sequential treatments that included flumioxazin at 140 g ha- 1 or diuron at 2, 690 g ha- 1 as <b>dormant</b> <b>applications</b> followed by a between cutting treatment of flumioxazin at 70 g ha- 1, which was still providing 85 to 96 % control in late summer. Several other treatments provided good early season Palmer amaranth control, but control diminished as the season progressed. Palmer amaranth emerges throughout the growing season and therefore, sequential herbicide treatments with good residual activity may be necessary for season-long control. Greenhouse studies indicated that glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp is present throughout eastern Kansas with several populations that survived glyphosate up to two times the suggested use rate. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth was documented in several populations collected from various counties throughout Kansas. Two populations collected in south central Kansas in 2011 survived up to eight times the typical field use rate of glyphosate. Six more populations collected in 2012 displayed similar resistance characteristics with three populations surviving up to four times the typical rate of glyphosate. Shikimate assays on susceptible and resistant Palmer amaranth biotypes confirmed resistance to glyphosate...|$|R
40|$|Diazinon is an {{organophosphate}} (OP) insecticide {{currently used}} {{on a wide variety}} of crops during California's irrigation season, as well as on dormant orchard trees during the winter season. Detections of diazinon in surface water have been reported in several areas of the state during all times of the year. The objective of this analysis was to assess recent (2003 - 2008) irrigation season surface water monitoring data from agricultural areas of California in order to determine the extent to which diazinon moves offsite into surface waters after irrigation season use. Monitoring data from sample sites that could potentially receive runoff from <b>dormant</b> spray <b>applications</b> of diazinon, or from urban sources, were identified and eliminated from the analysis in order to focus the analysis on irrigation season uses and sources.

5000|$|Fungicides are {{a control}} measure {{commonly}} used once grape anthracnose has become established in a vineyard. The most important fungicide application occurs {{in early spring}} during the dormant period before bud swell. [...] A lime-sulfur solution is most commonly used. This is typically applied {{at a rate of}} ten gallons per acre. [...] Commercially available Sulforix can also be used at a rate of one gallon per acre. [...] Both fungicides target the sclerotia overwintering in the canes. This <b>dormant</b> fungicide <b>application</b> is then followed up throughout the season by foliar sprays—sprays that target the surface of foliage. These sprays help protect the new susceptible tissues. Foliar sprays are typically recommended at two-week intervals. Other commercial products often used include Mancozeb, Captan, Ziram, Sovran, Rally, Elite, Inspire Super, Adamant, Mettle, Revus Top, Vintage, and Pristine. [...] The majority of these fungicides are sterol inhibitors and a few are EBDC—non-systemic, surface-acting fungicides. It is important to use fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance development.|$|R

30|$|This {{study used}} a {{completely}} randomized design with four treatments and a sample population of naturally regenerated, grass stage longleaf pine seedlings. We conducted {{an inventory of}} all seedlings within the central 1  ha of the stand and stratified seedlings into three classes of root collar diameter (RCD): Small (6.4 to 13.0  mm), Medium (13.1 to 19.0  mm), and Large (19.1 to 25.4  mm). Seedlings with obvious damage (e.g., brown-spot needle blight [caused by Mycosphaerella dearnessii Barr]) were removed from consideration for the study, as were seedlings located within 5  m of canopy trees or within 1  m of other seedlings. Seedlings in each size class were then {{randomly assigned to one}} of four treatments, including an untreated control (Control), a high-temperature burn treatment (HB; maximum [recorded on 1  s intervals] TC temperature ~[*] 425  °C), a low-temperature burn treatment (LB; maximum [recorded on 1  s intervals] TC temperature ~[*] 225  °C), and mechanical removal of foliage (Clip). Study treatments were applied in January and in May 2013 to compare the effects of dormant and growing season application on response variables. The sample population for the <b>dormant</b> season <b>application</b> was 12 seedlings for each seedling size × treatment combination (n[*]=[*] 144), and the sample population for the growing season application was 10 seedlings per combination (n[*]=[*] 120).|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to our expectation, several of our {{results indicate that}} season of burn affected longleaf pine seedling response (Hypothesis 3). Although previous experimental studies have generally reported no effects of burn month or season on longleaf pine mortality across tree size classes (Glitzenstein et al. 1995, Jack et al. 2010), our study, which considers a smaller range of seedling sizes, suggests that season of burn may interact with seedling size and fire intensity to affect survival response. For example, mortality of Small seedlings was greater for the growing season <b>application</b> than the <b>dormant</b> season <b>application</b> for the low-temperature burn treatment, but the high-temperature burn treatment resulted in high mortality regardless of season. In contrast, Medium seedlings were large enough for high survival regardless of burn season for the low-temperature burn treatment but had lower survival with growing season burns than dormant season burns for the high-temperature burn treatment (Fig. 3). For Large seedlings, burn season had no effect regardless of fire intensity. Given that ambient temperatures were higher during burns in May than in January, and the fire intensity measures of Area 60 and Dur 60 were greater in May than in January, we cannot determine if the burn season effect would be attributed to seedling physiology or to differences in fire treatment intensity. However, the mortality models suggest {{that the effect of}} burn season on seedling mortality was primarily attributed to differences in mortality that took place during the second growing season.|$|R
40|$|One-year-old shoots {{of apple}} (Malus xdomestica Borkh,) {{rootstock}} Malling 9 (M. 9 clone Nic 29), approximate to 60 cm long without sylleptic side shoots, were selected randomly from a commercial stoolbed in Belgium, prepared, and forced at 25 degrees C and 16 hours daylength to follow bud developmental rate in different positions along a 1 -year-old shoot. The number of buds that reached green tip was recorded daily until 50 % of shoots exhibited budburst. The evolution of dormancy of the terminal, an upper lateral, and a lon er lateral bud was followed throughout the dormant period. The {{influence of a}} distal disbudded shoot piece and Promalin [3000 mg. L- 1 N-(phenylmethyl) - 1 H-purine 6 -amine and 3000 mg. L- 1 gibberellins A(4) +A(7) without a wetting agent] application on the developmental rate of these buds was evaluated. Bud developmental rate decreased during winter and increased to a maximum before budburst in spring. The distal shoot-forming ability or acrotonic branching habit in apple appears to be mediated via a greatly increased developmental rate of the terminal bud relative to {{the upper and lower}} lateral buds, respectively. The proximal budbursting tendency or basitony exhibited in early winter was weak compared to the acrotony that developed in the last month before budburst in spring. Lateral buds showed a lower developmental rate than the terminals when inhibited by a distal disbudded shoot piece, so that resultant overall growth habit within the shoot remained acrotonic throughout the <b>dormant</b> period. Promalin <b>application</b> in winter did not restore the bud developmental rate associated with spring budburst. These results are discussed with reference to observations of trees growing under conditions of insufficient winter chilling. status: publishe...|$|R
