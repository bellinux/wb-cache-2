6000|$|... 'For Heaven's sake, Ethelberta,' {{he exclaimed}} with great excitement, 'where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> {{with such a}} terrible {{experience}} as that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Randal, {{you must}} rouse yourself. Surely {{you can tell}} us something. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with any {{agreeable}} people, while you were away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't want to {{hear any}} more! This is your respect for your father's memory,' groaned the widow. 'When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him again?' ...|$|E
3000|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to {{maintain}} your religious community? What difficulties <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> deal with them in your activities? [...]...|$|R
5000|$|... “Wherever you go, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> whoever <b>you</b> <b>meet,</b> {{social skills}} {{are essential for}} success” - Jon D. Williams III ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>you</b> have! well, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>meet</b> with a {{house in}} Paris that they call the Tuileries? because it's a dog-kennel to the Alacrity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, {{only one}} string to your bow of distrust? Fie, Mary Louise! When you were selling Liberty Bonds, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with no objectors?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{it would}} be pleasanter if her only living {{relative}} were not a swindler!... Tell me, where and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> this girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment, and then Hulton asked: [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> the man you thought was Jordan? Did he answer you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} do not come for some days," [...] said Mrs. Stanhope. [...] "For if they <b>do,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>meet,</b> I feel {{sure there will be}} serious trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>meet</b> him, Monsieur?" [...] she demanded. [...] "He left an {{hour ago}} for New Orleans. You must have met a gentleman riding very fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{name of her}} father's correspondent! The name {{which she}} vaguely remembered to have heard in her childhood! [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> first <b>meet</b> with him?" [...] she inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a most}} unpleasant-looking man," [...] Lady Deringham faltered, white now to the lips. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him? Here or in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "that sort {{of sailing}} must have {{astonished}} any ship that saw it. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> any other vessels?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{never met}} you before," [...] {{answered}} Dave, quickly. [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> the other fellow, and where? I am {{very anxious to}} locate him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have nothing}} to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed between you and Philip Wakem. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> first <b>meet</b> him in the Red Deeps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did feel}} a little that way, too," [...] said Anne. [...] "I kind of felt I shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was IRRESISTIBLE. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with an irresistible temptation?" ...|$|R
60|$|Reynard, {{wherever}} <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him, {{whether on}} the old road at twilight, or on the runway before the hounds, impresses you as an animal of dignity and calculation. He never seems surprised, much less frightened; never loses his head; never does things hurriedly, or {{on the spur of}} the moment, as a scatter-brained rabbit or meddling squirrel might <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>meet</b> him, perhaps as he leaves the warm rock on the south slope of the old oak woods, where he has been curled up asleep all the sunny afternoon. (It is easy to find him there in winter.) Now he is off on his nightly hunt; he is trotting along, head down, brows deep-wrinkled, planning it all out.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Emily, {{with her}} face turned away. [...] "He went out and left us {{a quarter of an}} hour since. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> Colonel Osborne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, she sought her brother's {{knowledge}} of Kelley. [...] "Tell me about him, Fred. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him first? He interests me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Haines missed you, he said. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him? He'll see {{you after}} at the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht.|$|E
60|$|If anybody {{wants to}} know how intimately authors are {{connected}} with the fashionable world, they have but to read the genteel novels. What refinement and delicacy pervades the works of Mrs. Barnaby! What delightful good company <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with in Mrs. Armytage! She seldom introduces you to anybody under a marquis! I don't know anything more delicious than the pictures of genteel life in 'Ten Thousand a Year,' except perhaps the 'Young Duke,' and 'Coningsby.' There's a modest grace about THEM, and an air of easy high fashion, which only belongs to blood, my dear Sir--to true blood.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{thank you}} for your greeting, but then, my uncle Abi, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>meet</b> us outside the gates of Memphis where we {{expected}} to find its governor waiting to deliver up the keys of Pharaoh's city to the officers of Pharaoh?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Schelling himself {{illustrated}} {{this concept}} {{with the following}} problem: [...] "Tomorrow <b>you</b> have to <b>meet</b> a stranger in NYC. Where and when <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> them?" [...] This is a coordination game, where any place and time in the city could be an equilibrium solution. Schelling asked {{a group of students}} this question, and found the most common answer was [...] "noon at (the information booth at) Grand Central Terminal". There is nothing that makes Grand Central Terminal a location with a higher payoff (you could just as easily meet someone at a bar or the public library reading room), but its tradition as a meeting place raises its salience and therefore makes it a natural [...] "focal point".|$|R
6000|$|... "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with him?" [...] asked Magdalen, {{putting the}} {{question}} as a chance means of increasing her scanty stock {{of information on the}} subject of Captain Wragge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do approve," [...] said Flora, {{trying to}} be calm. [...] "Perhaps it wasn't really humorous, but I was forced to laugh. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> Harry? He went to look for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, all {{you poor}} idiots who write things have some fine tale {{to tell their}} typewriter," [...] she remarked. [...] "You seem as though you mean it, though. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> Elizabeth Dalstan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>meet</b> Mr. Fitzallen, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{tell him}} nothing else except {{that you were}} engaged to me? Did you say nothing to him as to your {{feelings}} towards himself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'm not {{inquisitive}} in asking--would {{you mind}} telling me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean to <b>meet</b> Matthews and young Hardman?" [...] inquired Wiggate, hesitatingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{often does}} he write to <b>you?</b> Where <b>does</b> {{he put his}} letters--when <b>does</b> he <b>meet</b> <b>you?</b> Ah, his letters! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> tell me his name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! I said I did not understand." [...] The {{feeling of}} having scored a point made Derek {{feel a little}} better. [...] "I admit it. Your {{behaviour}} is incomprehensible. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> this fellow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd {{like some}} information," [...] said Dick, {{stepping}} forward and {{holding up the}} lantern. [...] "We {{are looking for a}} big enclosed touring car that came this way. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> it on the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely {{the same}} with my bird. He wants to get his music sung but nobody'll sing it. But I didn't know you knew any Greenwich Village warblers, {{sunshine}} of my home. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> this female?" ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{visitors}} took {{a minute}} to appear, and Mrs. Brook, not stirring--still only looking from the sofa calmly up at Mr. Cashmore--used the time, it might have seemed, for correcting any impression of undue levity made by her recent question. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> last <b>meet</b> Nanda?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{liked it}} amazingly. He quite forgot the {{conclusion}} {{at which he}} had arrived respecting society a year ago, drawn from his vast experience of the single party which he had then attended. Feelings are different when you know a great many persons, and every person is trying to please you; above all, when there are individuals whom <b>you</b> want to <b>meet,</b> and whom, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>meet,</b> <b>you</b> become restless.|$|R
40|$|The Decision Support Systems {{web site}} {{promises}} to deliver information on demand. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that? More specifically, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> the requests of many users who span {{all levels of}} the organization and need different levels of data? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> optimize the user experience that is dialing over a 28. 8 modem? “Ask DSS”, partially modeled after “Ask Jeeves ” is one such application. All users choose from a prearranged set of questions. Each question has several pull-down boxes to let users tailor it for their particular inquiry. We term this a &quot;predefined where clause with variable values. &quot; It’s easily maintained because each question has its own SAS program called from the SAS/IntrNet ® broker. Macro code manages the dynamic decision making of which user and what data, and JavaScript within the web page manages the questions submitted and the necessary parameters to pass...|$|R
