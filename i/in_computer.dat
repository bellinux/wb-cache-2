5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use <b>in</b> <b>computer</b> memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements <b>in</b> <b>computer</b> performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

They are the inverse functions of the double exponential function, tetration, of , and of the logistic function, respectively.|$|E
