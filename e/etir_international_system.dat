50|$|Polarity in {{international}} relations refers to the arrangement of power within the <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> The concept arose from bipolarity during the Cold War, with the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> dominated by the conflict between two superpowers, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> prior to 1945 {{can be described as}} multipolar, with power being shared among Great powers.|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{systemic}} war seems dependant {{on the level}} of criticality and sensitivity of the <b>International</b> <b>System,</b> and the system's conditions. The level of criticality and sensitivity is dependant on the developmental stage of the <b>International</b> <b>System.</b> Initially, following a systemic war, the increase of the level of criticality and sensitivity go hand in hand. However, at a certain stage the sensitivity of the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> for larger sized wars decreases; as a consequence of a network effect, we argue. This network effect results in increased local stability of the System. During this phase the criticality of the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> steadily increases, resulting in a release deficit. This release deficit facilitates a necessary build up of energy to push the <b>International</b> <b>System,</b> by means {{of systemic}} war, into a new stability domain. Systemic war is functional in the periodic rebalancing of an anarchistic <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> Comment: 32 pages, 13 figures, 11 table...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I discuss {{the outcome of}} an {{exploratory}} research project based on complexity science concepts and theories; this research {{is focused on the}} Great Power war dynamics in the time period 1495 - 1945. According to this research, the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> has self-organized critical (SOC) characteristics. A critical point is the attractor of the <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> The war dynamics of Great Powers can be illustrated by a power law. As a result of a driving force, the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> is constantly being pushed toward this critical point. The security dilemma is a booster of this driving force. Tension and frustration build up in the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> as a result of various system thresholds, and are periodically discharged through wars. The SOC characteristics of the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> result in a punctuated equilibrium dynamic. The punctuations produce new <b>international</b> <b>systems,</b> each with its specific characteristics. A quantifiable development of the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> toward a condition of increased stability and reduced resilience can be observed. In addition to SOC characteristics, the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> exhibits characteristics of a chaotic system. Chaos, order and development are closely linked. The SOC dynamics generate a process of social expansion. It is possible to explain the social integration of Europe from this perspective. Comment: Withdrawn.

40|$|Abstract. —The oldest {{original}} <b>international</b> <b>system</b> from {{a political}} science and world historical perspective is the West Asian <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> Reported here are findings of a study to identify, measure, and describe {{the composition of the}} earliest <b>international</b> <b>system</b> in terms of politically autonomous units, similar to earlier studies of the modern <b>international</b> <b>system</b> of nation-states and its polity membership. Autonomous polities include states, as well as chiefdoms and empires, from ca. 6000 B. C. to 1500 B. C., after which this pristine West Asian <b>international</b> <b>system</b> expanded into a much larger interaction network comprising the Euro-West Asian <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> The new data set developed for this study is based on primary sources from archaeology and epigraphy, and contains over two hundred polity-periods covering the initial 4, 500 years (‘Ubaid period to end of Old Babylonian period). Scientists who study large-scale complex systems—such as the physical universe or the Earth’s biosphere—spend considerable effort measuring and trying to understand the origins, composition, and early evolution of such systems. They use raw data collected by instruments to develop and test hypotheses and theories to explain phenomena of interest: be they stella...|$|R

The rise of China faces the post-Cold-War <b>international</b> <b>system</b> {{with one of the}} most significant changes in power distribution; as such, it is of significant importance for the entire field of international relations. The thesis aims to evaluate the Chinese rise to power, and determine whether the country should be considered a great power affecting the <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> To achieve this goal, the author performs a two-level analysis based on the theory of realism, which first analyzes China's position as a state and then its impact on the <b>international</b> <b>system.</b> The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first one sets the theoretical framework. Chapters two to five look into China's position of power in the military, economic, political and socio-environmental dimension. The sixth chapter analyzes the influence of China on the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> in the case study of the current China-U. S. relations. The thesis concludes that China could be considered a great power, but only a partial one with a limited impact on the <b>international</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

Atsižvelgiant į klasikinius tarptautinės sistemos transformacijos principus, šiame straipsnyje nagrinėjamas šiuolaikinės tarptautinės sistemos polinės struktūros transformacijos procesas, keliant prielaidas dėl galimo šios transformacijos rezultato. In the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century different features of the transformation of the contemporary <b>international</b> <b>system</b> could be studied. Among these features changes in nature of threats, actions of main actors of <b>international</b> <b>system</b> concerning changing security environment, appearance of new centers of power and military confrontation between the USA and Russia could be distinguished. Impact of polarity of the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> towards <b>international</b> security {{was one of the most}} popular topics of international relations in the second half of the 20 th century. Concept of polarity as certain distribution of power in <b>international</b> <b>system</b> became very popular due to Realism school of international relations. Many different studies were made concerning this topic in the Cold War period, but after the end of the Cold War topics of <b>international</b> <b>system</b> and polarity in the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> seemed as unimportant and lost its significance. The new importance of polarity conception was brought by the emergence of new types of threats to international security and by unequal distribution of power in the <b>international</b> <b>system</b> that created unipolar structure with one superpower and several smaller centers of power in {{the beginning}} of the 21 st century. In this article few presumptions and conclusions concerning the transformation of the contemporary polar structure of <b>international</b> <b>systems</b> were made. First presumption is that contemporary <b>international</b> <b>system</b> is transforming from strict unipolarity with one exceptionally strong superpower to modified unipolarity with one superpower and several emerging centers of power. Second presumption is that emergence of transnational threats is working as a kind of absorbing mechanism in the context of polarity: superpower is restraining its unilateral actions for collective actions against the threat and losing a part of power, vice versa, superpower is strengthening its positions in polar structure via conducting collective actions. Third presumption is that emerging military confrontation between the USA and Russia could be treated as a certain indicator that the transformation of the polar structure in <b>international</b> <b>system</b> is in process...|$|R

40|$|The <b>International</b> <b>System</b> is a self-organized {{system that}} shows {{emergent}} behavior. During the timeframe (1495 - 1945) covered in this study, a finite-time singularity and four accompanying accelerating log-periodic cycles shaped {{the dynamics of}} the <b>International</b> <b>System.</b> Each cycle began and ended with a systemic war. During their life span, these cycles show remarkable regularities in their dynamics. The accelerated growth of the connectivity of the regulatory network of the <b>International</b> <b>System,</b> in combination with its anarchistic structure, produce and shape the war dynamics of the system. The accelerated growth of the connectivity of the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> is fed by population growth and the need for social systems to fulfill basic requirements. The finite-time singularity and accompanying log-periodic oscillations were instrumental in the periodic reorganization of the regulatory network of the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> and contributed to a long-term process of social expansion and integration in Europe. The singularity dynamic produced a series of organizational innovations. At the critical time of the singularity (1939), the connectivity of the system reached a critical threshold and resulted in a critical transition that led to a fundamental reorganization of the <b>International</b> <b>System.</b> Europe transformed from an anarchistic system to a cooperative security community. During the life span of the cycles, the war dynamics showed chaotic characteristics. These findings have implications for the social sciences and historical research.
