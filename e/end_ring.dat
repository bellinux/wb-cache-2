60|$|Once, at early twilight, I lay {{in hiding}} among some old roots {{at the end}} of this little beach, {{watching}} a curious game. Eight or ten deer, does and fawns and young spike bucks, had come out into the open and were now running rapidly in three circles arranged in a line, so, oOo. In the middle was a big circle some fifteen feet in diameter, and at opposite sides were two smaller circles less than half the diameter of the first, as I found afterwards by measuring from the tracks. Around one of these small circles the deer ran from right to left invariably; around the other they ran from left to right; and around the big middle circle they ran either way, though when two or three were running this circle together, while the others bounded about the ends, they all ran the same way. As they played, all the rings were in use at once, the two small end rings being much more used than the big one. The individual deer passed rapidly from one ring to the others, but--and here is the queerest part of it all--I did not see a single deer, not even one of the fawns, cut across the big circle from one <b>end</b> <b>ring</b> to the other. After they were gone the rings showed clearly in the sand, but not a single track led across any of the circles.|$|E

40|$|In {{squirrel}} cage rotors of induction machines with unconventional end region structure, the three-dimensional {{effects can be}} more pronounced as compared to conventional induction machines.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} by selective saturation deuteron NMR {{experiments on}} a crystal of selectively deuterated o-terphenyl (OTP) that both <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> I and II {{attached to the}} central ring undergo thermally activated flip motions. In crystals of OTP, the <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> I and II are not symmetry related, their dynamics can be different and, in fact, is different, although mutual steric hindrance of the rings suggests a strong correlation. We measured the rates k I and k II of the flips of both <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> I and II {{as a function of}} temperature. We find that, independent of the temperature, k I exceeds k II by roughly a factor of 100. This result excludes correlated flips of rings I and II in the sense that a flip of one ring necessarily entails a flip of the other. The activation energies EaI and EaII of the two flip processes turn out to be equal (80. 5 kJ mol− 1) within experimental errors.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to utilize the {{technology}} developed at LUT and to provide an easy tool for high-speed solid-rotor induction machine preliminary design. Computer aided design tool MathCAD has been chosen as the environment for realizing the calculation program. Four versions of the design program have been made depending on the motor rotor type. The first rotor type is an axially slitted solid-rotor with steel <b>end</b> <b>rings.</b> The next one is an axially slitted solid-rotor with copper <b>end</b> <b>rings.</b> The third machine type is a solid rotor with deep, rectangular copper bars and <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> (squirrel cage). And the last one is a solid-rotor with round copper bars and <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> (squirrel cage). Each type of rotor has its own specialties but a general thread of design is common. This paper follows {{the structure of the}} calculating program and explains some features and formulas. The attention is concentrated on the difference between laminated and solid-rotor machine design principles. There is no deep analysis of the calculation ways are presented. References for all solution methods appearing during the design procedure are given for more detailed studying. This thesis pays respect to the latest innovations in solid-rotor machines theory. Rotor ends’ analytical calculation follows the latest knowledge in this field. Correction factor for adjusting the rotor impedance is implemented. The purpose of the created design program is to calculate the preliminary dimensions of the machine according to initial data. Obtained results are not recommended for exact machine development. Further more detailed design should be done in a finite element method application. Hence, this thesis is a practical tool for the prior evaluating of the high-speed machine with different solid-rotor types parameters...|$|R

40|$|Oxidation {{models of}} a rotor bar and <b>end</b> <b>ring</b> segment in an {{induction}} motor are presented {{to simulate the}} behavior of an induction machine working with oxidized rotor parts which are modeled as rotor faults in progress. The leakage inductanceand resistance of the rotor parts are different from normal values because of the oxidation process. The impedance variations modify the current density and magnetic flux which pass through the oxidized parts. Consequently, it causes the rotor asymmetry which induces abnormal harmonics in the stator current spectra of the faulty machine. The leakage inductances of the oxidation models are derived by the Ampere's law. Using the proposed oxidation models, the rotor bar and <b>end</b> <b>ring</b> faults in progress can be modeled and simulated with the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). In addition, the oxidation process of the rotor bar and <b>end</b> <b>ring</b> segment can motivate the rotor asymmetry, which is induced by electromagnetic imbalances, {{and it is one}} of the major motor faults.

Here, we present a femtosecond spectroscopic study comparing OCP and RCP (red carotenoid protein) samples binding different carotenoids. We confirmed significant changes in carotenoid configuration upon OCP activation reported by Leverenz et al. (Science 348 : 1463 - 1466. doi: 10. 1126 /science. aaa 7234, 2015) by comparing the transient spectra of OCP and RCP. The most important marker of these changes was the magnitude of the transient signal associated with the carotenoid intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state. While OCP with canthaxanthin exhibited a weak ICT signal, it increased significantly for canthaxanthin bound to RCP. On the contrary, a strong ICT signal was recorded in OCP binding echinenone excited at the red edge of the absorption spectrum. Because the carbonyl oxygen responsible for the appearance of the ICT signal is located at the <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> of both carotenoids, the magnitude of the ICT signal can be used to estimate the torsion angles of the <b>end</b> <b>rings.</b> Application of two different excitation wavelengths to study OCP demonstrated that the OCP sample contains two spectroscopically distinct populations, none of which is corresponding to the photoactivated product of OCP...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{series of}} {{light-emitting}} oligo(p-phenylene-vinylene) s (BIII and BV series containing three- and five-conjugated phenylene rings) with various side groups and end groups {{attached to the}} cores were synthesized and characterized. The analo-gous PBV polymers, derived from the BV series, were also synthesized and investigated. Blue and greenish light emissions were observed in the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the blend and pure films with these p-conjugated structures. In contrast to the three-conjugated ring oligomers, the five-conjugated ring derivatives (oligomers and polymers) had larger maximum emission wavelength values of PL and EL emissions. Mesomorphism was introduced into the BV series by the replacement of three-conjugated rings (BIII series) with five-conjugated phenyl cores (BV series). The liquid-crystalline properties of the BV series with end groups (on both <b>end</b> <b>rings)</b> were better than those of analogous BV-OC 8 without end groups. Polarized PL emissions were obtained by the alignment of liquid-crystalline phase in rubbing cells. Upon heating, different PL emission wavelengths and intensities were observed in various phases. Not only the solubility and thermal properties but also the PL and EL properties could be effectively adjusted by the attachment of flexible alkoxy groups either on the central rings or on both <b>end</b> <b>rings</b> of the conjugated cores.
