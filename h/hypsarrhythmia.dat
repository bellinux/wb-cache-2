50|$|The name of William West is {{best known}} for the eponymous syndrome, even though the {{convention}} on the use of this name is relatively recent and dates back to 1960, when H.

The methods of this meeting were published in the book Lencéphalopathie Myoclonique Infantile avec Hypsarythmie (infantile myoclonic encephalopathy with <b>hypsarrhythmia)</b> and was at that conference that H. Gastaut suggested the use of West syndrome as an eponym for infantile spasms; which is widely used for the syndrome to date.|$|E
50|$|West {{syndrome}} is a triad of developmental delay, seizures termed infantile spasms, and EEG demonstrating a pattern termed <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Onset occurs between {{three months and}} two years, with peak onset between eight and 9 months. West syndrome may arise from idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic causes. The most common cause is tuberous sclerosis. The prognosis varies with the underlying cause. In general, most surviving patients remain with significant cognitive impairment and continuing seizures and may evolve to another eponymic syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It can be classified as idiopathic, syndromic, or cryptogenic depending on cause and can arise from both focal or generalized epileptic lesions.|$|E
50|$|William James West, was an English {{surgeon and}} apothecary, who {{among other things}} took a {{prominent}} role in the local movement of reform of medical practice. He published in 1837 the first article referred to an ovariectomy performed in England and first described the picture of a kind of infantile spasm (present in his own son, James Edwin West) in an article published by The Lancet in 1841. this syndrome is typically characterized by three findings: epileptic spasms, psychomotor retardation and electroencephalogram with a characteristic layout of <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> although one of the three may not appear.|$|E
5000|$|Epileptic spasms, {{also known}} as {{infantile}} spasms, juvenile spasms, or West syndrome is an uncommon-to-rare epileptic disorder in infants, children and adults. It is named after the English physician, William James West (1793-1848), who first described it {{in an article published}} in The Lancet in 1841. The original case actually described his own son, James Edwin West (1840-1860). Other names for it are [...] "Generalized Flexion Epilepsy", [...] "Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy", [...] "Infantile Myoclonic Encephalopathy", [...] "jackknife convulsions", [...] "Massive Myoclonia" [...] and [...] "Salaam spasms". The term [...] "infantile spasms" [...] can be used to describe the specific seizure manifestation in the syndrome, but is also used as a synonym for the syndrome itself. West syndrome in modern usage is the triad of infantile spasms, a pathognomonic EEG pattern (called <b>hypsarrhythmia),</b> and developmental regression - although the international definition requires only two out of these three elements.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere is poor inter-rater {{agreement}} {{in determining the}} presence or absence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> among patients with infantile spasms. Yet, remission of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> has been used as a clinical and research outcome measure. Two important features of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> are the burden of epileptiform discharges and the amplitudes of background slow waves. We hypothesized that an electroencephalogram (EEG) grading scale emphasizing epileptiform discharge burden and the amplitudes of background slow waves would improve {{inter-rater agreement}} in interpreting <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Our aim was to assess inter-rater agreement of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> using a novel and simplified EEG grading scale called the ‘BASED’ (Burden of Amplitudes and Epileptiform Discharges) score and compare this to the traditional method of EEG analysis. MethodsTwenty patients with infantile spasms were prospectively evaluated and electroclinical outcomes were determined. Forty EEG clips (20 pre-treatment and 20 post-treatment), representing the most severely abnormal five minute sleep epoch of each study, were assessed by three reviewers blinded to treatment and clinical outcome. Fleiss’ kappa (К) was used to assess the inter-rater agreement in the interpretation of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> when using the BASED score compared to the traditional method of EEG analysis. ResultsReviewers had favorable inter-rater agreement using the BASED score in interpreting <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> (К: 0. 87) compared to when using the traditional method of EEG analysis to interpret <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> (К: 0. 09). The three reviewers all agreed on {{the presence or absence}} of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> in 37 / 40 (93 %) epochs using the BASED score but in only 15 / 40 (38 %) epochs using the traditional method of EEG analysis, p=< 0. 001. ConclusionWhen compared to the traditional method of EEG analysis, the BASED score allowed for better inter-rater agreement in the interpretation of <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Future infantile spasms clinical trials must better define criteria for <b>hypsarrhythmia...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{infantile}} spasms {{syndrome is}} {{a subset of}} epileptic syndrome occurring in children {{less than two years}} old. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> whose EEG patterns display large amplitudes, multifocal sharp waves, and described as disorganization. However, there are many variations of <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> and the criteria for recognizing <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> vary across clinicians, leading to a need for a differentiable pattern among the clinically diagnosed <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> patients and those without <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Patients in this study had recorded EEG of the pre- and post- treatment in both awake and sleep states. The EEG data of these patients underwent a connectivity analysis using maximum cross correlations among electrode pairs. Previous research has shown EEG connectivity leads to unique connectivity and network stability in adult patients. We incorporated these techniques to study the brain networks of children with infantile spasms. More specifically, we wanted to focus on spatial distributions of connectivity, statistical analysis on connectivity, and network stability. From our analysis, there is a statistical difference between spatial distributions of connectivity in patients of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and non-hypsarrhythmia across all states. Furthermore, there is a statistical increase in long range connections for <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> patients in the sleep states, both pre- and post- treatment. We are also able to note network stability with increasing temporal window size, but more stability in the pre- than post-treatment and in the sleep than awake state. This analysis is intriguing because the disorganization of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> may lead to assume the networks are not stable over long periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Occurrence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> {{after the}} age of 3 years is rare. The {{objective}} {{of this study is to}} describe a group of patients who have persistence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> {{after the age}} of 3 years. The authors retrospectively reviewed the EEGs of 24 patients with <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Electroencephalographies (EEGs) were scored using a <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> scale. The clinical data of 7 patients with EEG scores greater than 9 at ages 3 years were analyzed. The mean age was 5. 7 years (range, 3 - 8. 7 years). EEG background amplitudes ranged from 200 to 500 mV in 5 patients and it was greater than 500 mV in the other 2. Six patients had electrodecre-mental responses. The etiology was developmental in 3 patients, mitochondrial disease in 2, and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in 2.

40|$|Infantile spasms {{syndrome}} is an epileptic encephalopathy in which prompt {{diagnosis and treatment}} initiation are critical to therapeutic response. Diagnosis of the disease heavily depends on the identification of characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, including <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> However, visual assessment of the presence and characteristics of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> is challenging because multiple variants of the pattern exist, leading to poor inter-rater reliability. We investigated whether a quantitative measurement of the control of neural synchrony in the EEGs of infantile spasms patients {{could be used to}} reliably distinguish the presence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and indicate successful treatment outcomes. We used autocorrelation and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to measure the strength of long-range temporal correlations in 21 infantile spasms patients before and after treatment and 21 control subjects. The strength of long-range temporal correlations was significantly lower in patients with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> than control patients, indicating decreased control of neural synchrony. There was no difference between patients without <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and control patients. Further, the presence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> could be classified based on the DFA exponent and intercept with 92 % accuracy using a support vector machine. Successful treatment was marked by a larger increase in the DFA exponent compared to those in which spasms persisted. These results suggest that the strength of long-range temporal correlations is a marker of pathological cortical activity that correlates with treatment response. Combined with current clinical measures, this quantitative tool has the potential to aid objective identification of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and assessment of treatment efficacy to inform clinical decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-six {{children}} (16 {{boys and}} 10 girls) with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and infantile spasms (IS) were {{studied at the}} University of Michigan EEG Laboratory in a 4 -year period. Six (2 boys, 4 girls), had asymmetric <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> with a preponderance of both slowing and epileptic form activity over one hemisphere. All 6 had the symptomatic form of IS, 4 with dysplastic conditions, 1 with porencephaly from a cerebral infarct, and 1 with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Five children had focal abnormalities on either physical examination or imaging studies. Four had the highest amplitude slowing and most epileptiform activity ipsilateral to the lesion, in 1, it was contralateral. Asymmetric <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> constituted 23 % of cases with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> examined at our EEG laboratory.

40|$|AbstractPurposeWest {{syndrome}} (WS) is {{a severe}} age-related acute epileptic encephalopathy of infancy characterized by infantile spasms, <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and psychomotor delay. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate if patients with WS had an altered autonomic output to the heart. MethodsIn 23 patients with WS the heart rate variability (HRV) was investigated by examining time- and frequency-domain parameters of HRV at the time of the diagnosis of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and compared to 22 age-matched controls. For the WS patients the same dataset was obtained and compared again at the end of the study period, when <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> was no longer present. ResultsCompared to controls, patients with WS during <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> had significantly lower SDNN (the standard deviation of the NN interval, i. e. the square root of variance) (19. 2 ms; p= 0. 007, Mann–Whitney's U-Test) and total power (242 ms 2; p= 0. 044, Mann–Whitney's U-Test) in the awake state, indicating an abnormal autonomic output to the heart. Comparing the initial to the final examination demonstrated a significant increase in the HRV parameters SDNN (31. 3 ms) and total power (757 ms 2; p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 013, Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test). In addition, at the final examination the WS-patients no longer differed significantly from the controls. ConclusionOur data suggest that the initial reduction in HRV in patients at the time of onset of WS is transient and related to the presence of <b>hypsarrhythmia...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: PEHO {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} symptom complex of severe progressive encephalopathy, edema, <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> and optic atrophy. Disease onset is in early infancy. The current case report presents and discusses serial conventional MR imaging findings and serial functional studies including diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative MR spectroscopy findings in a 6 -year-old child with PEHO. The PEHO {{syndrome is}} a rare symptom complex of severeprogressive encephalopathy with edema, <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> and optic atrophy that has only recently been described by Salonen et al. 1 The distinct clinical features include profound mental retardation, edema of the face and limbs (especially in early childhood), infantile spasms with <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> and severe hypotonia with prominent deep tendon reflexes. 1 The dysmorphic facial features may raise the suspicion of the PEHO syndrome; these features are, however, nonspecific and result from the progressive microcephaly, edema, and hypo-tonia. 1, 2 Disease onset is in early infancy. Most children appear healthy at birth or may be slightly hypotonic. 1, 2 Visual failur...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{therapeutic}} efficacy of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) {{in the treatment of}} infantile spasms (IS) with <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> we studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of ACTH in 15 children (4 - 10 months) affected by IS with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> (eight cryptogenic forms, seven secondary to perinatal distress) and in age-matched controls. Lumbar puncture was performed in all but one case before any kind of treatment. In another case, CSF was collected 3 weeks after a spontaneous remission. Both ACTH and beta-endorphin (beta-EP), the other peptide related to the same precursor (proopiomelanocortin), were measured by specific radioimmunoassay after gel chromatography. While beta-EP levels were unchanged in the two groups of patients, ACTH concentrations of cryptogenic (3. 75 +/- 2. 40 fmol/ml, Mean +/- SD p less than 0. 05) and secondary (6. 36 +/- 3. 70, NS) forms were lower than in controls (10. 90 +/- 5. 79). On the other hand, ACTH was higher in the case studied after therapy (9. 0) and in the case presenting a spontaneous clinical and EEG remission (15. 0). These data indicate that in children affected by IS with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> (mainly of cryptogenic type), CSF levels of ACTH are lower, while levels of beta-EP remain normal. It would therefore appear that central ACTH content may play a possible role in the pathogenesis of IS with <b>hypsarrhythmia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Infantile spasm (IS) is {{the archetypal}} catastrophic {{childhood}} epilepsy syndrome. It is catastrophic for two reasons: first, {{it is difficult}} to control and second, it is strongly associated with mental retardation. In some cases, profound mental retardation is an inevitable consequence of the underlying disease; for example, lissencephaly. In other cases, the developmental outcome may be improved by controlling the seizures. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment is important. IS has a characteristic clinical presentation with flexor spasms beginning {{in the first year of}} life. The diagnosis of IS is confirmed by the electroencephalogram (EEG), which typically demonstrated <b>hypsarrhythmia,</b> modified <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> or multifocal spike...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe report two {{individual}} cases of cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome with severe neurological impairment consisting of infantile spasms with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and refractory epilepsy with multifocal epileptic paroxysms such as modified <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> Both cases shared diffuse brain atrophy and severely delayed myelination on neuroimaging. Genetic analysis revealed individual heterozygous mutations in the KRAS (phenotype of CFC/Noonan syndrome) and BRAF genes (phenotype of CFC syndrome).

40|$|The current {{spectrum}} of disorders associated to clinical spasms with onset in infancy is wider than previously thought; accordingly, its terminology has changed. Nowadays, the term Infantile spasms syndrome (ISs) defines an epileptic syndrome occurring in {{children younger than}} 1 year (rarely older than 2 years), with clinical (epileptic: i. e., associated to an epileptiform EEG) spasms usually occurring in clusters whose most characteristic EEG finding is <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> [the spasms are often associated with developmental arrest or regression]. The term West syndrome (WS) refers to a form (a subset) of ISs, characterised by the combination of clustered spasms and <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> on an EEG and delayed brain development or regression [currently, {{it is no longer}} required that delayed development occur before the onset of spasms]. Less usually, spasms may occur singly rather than in clusters [infantile spasms single-spasm variant (ISSV) ], <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> can be (incidentally) recorded without any evidence of clinical spasms [hypsarrhythmia without infantile spasms (HWIS) ] or typical clinical spasms may manifest in absence of <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> [infantile spasms without <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> (ISW) ]. There is a growing evidence that ISs and related phenotypes may result, besides from acquired events, from disturbances in key genetic pathways of brain development: specifically, in the gene regulatory network of GABAergic forebrain dorsal-ventral development, and abnormalities in molecules expressed at the synapse. Children with these genetic associations also have phenotypes beyond epilepsy, including dysmorphic features, autism, movement disorders and systemic malformations. The prognosis depends on: (a) the cause, which gives origin to the attacks (the complex malformation forms being more severe); (b) the EEG pattern(s); (c) the appearance of seizures prior to the spasms; and (d) the rapid response to treatment. Currently, the first-line treatment includes the adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH and vigabatrin. In the near future the gold standard could be the development of new therapies that target specific pathways of pathogenesis. In this article we review the past and growing number of clinical, genetic, molecular and therapeutic discoveries on this expanding topic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeHypsarrhythmia, the {{pathognomonic}} EEG {{pattern of}} West syndrome, is typically {{characterized by a}} high amplitude, arrhythmic, and asynchronous pattern. While this severely aberrant pattern would suggest severe abnormalities in connectivity, coherence {{has not yet been}} systematically assessed in <b>hypsarrhythmia.</b> MethodsWe evaluated the EEGs of 28 infants, 12 with infantile spasms with <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> and 16 similarly age control infants for coherence and spectral power. ResultsChildren with infantile spasms and <b>hypsarrhythmia</b> EEGs had marked abnormalities in coherence and spectral power compared to normal children of similar ages. During sleep increases in delta, theta, alpha and beta coherences were seen, particularly at long inter-electrode distances while at short inter-electrode distances coherences were decreased in the theta and beta range, particularly in the frontal region. The enhanced coherences at long inter-electrode distances suggest that during sleep in children with infantile spasms widely spread cortical region do not have functional differentiation whereas in the frontal lobe there is reduced functional connectivity and integration of local cortical regions. Children with continued seizures and developmental delay showed persistent abnormalities in coherence. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that hypsarrhythmic EEGs have marked abnormalities in coherence spectral power and such abnormalities may be related to cognitive impairment...|$|E
