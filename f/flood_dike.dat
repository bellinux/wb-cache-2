5000|$|In May 2013, Galena {{suffered}} a freak catastrophic flood when the spring breakup on the Yukon River caused an ice jam approximately 20 miles downstream, backing {{up the river}} and affecting 90% of homes in the city. This flood was {{on the scale of}} a flood never seen before by Galena residents. In the part of town closest to the river, houses were submerged to the roofs in water, and properties on higher ground suffered damage also. Most of the residents had to evacuate in thanks to the efforts of the local airline and the Alaska National Guard. Some of the residents chose to stay behind and took refuge in the few last remaining dry parts of town. The <b>flood</b> <b>dike</b> the Air Force built around the runway managed to keep the river from inundating the runway and GILA. [...] Efforts are currently underway to help Galena rebuild, {{with the assistance of the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency and volunteer groups.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation of floodplain at Musi River using integrated 1 D and 2 D hydrodynamic model. The 1 D flow simulation {{was applied for}} the river channel with flow hydrograph as upstream boundary condition. The result of 1 D flow simulation was integrated into 2 D flow simulation in order to know the area and characteristics of flood inundation. The input data of digital terrain model which {{was used in this}} research had grid resolution of 10 m× 10 m, but for 2 D simulation the resolution was with grid resolution 50 m × 50 m so as to limit simulation time since the model size was big enough. The result of the simulation showed that the inundated area surrounding Musi River is about 107. 44 km 2 with maximum flood depth is 3. 24 m, water surface velocity ranges from 0. 00 to 0. 83 m/s. Most of floodplain areas varied from middle to high flood hazard level, and only few areas had very high level of flood hazard especially on river side. The structural flood control measurement to be recommended to Palembang is to construct <b>flood</b> <b>dike</b> and flood gate. The non structural measurement one is to improve watershed management and socialization of flood awareness...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{models are}} often used to {{describe}} flow and deformation processes occurring in <b>dikes</b> during <b>flood</b> events. Modeling of such phenomena is a challenging task, due {{to the complexity of}} the system, consisting of three material phases: soil skeleton, pore water and pore air. Additional difficulties are transient loading caused by variable in time water levels, heterogeneity of the soil or air trapping. This paper presents a brief review of the influence of the air phase in soil on water flow and pore pressure generation, with focus on applications related to stability of dikes, earth dams and similar structures. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the differences between the Richards equation and the two-phase flow model, using an in-house code based on the finite volume method. A variety of boundary problems are considered, including seepage through <b>flood</b> <b>dikes,</b> dike overtopping and water level fluctuations. Special attention is paid to the problem of air trapping, which occurs when water flows over the top of a dike. Such a phenomenon occurred during experiments on model dikes reported in the literature, ultimately leading to development of cracks and damages in dike structure...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a novel {{interpretation}} of the introduction of floodplain rehabilitation and rural development into the water policy for the Tisza River in Hungary. It looks at the role of individuals and the strategies {{that they used to}} bring about water policy change. Five strategies are explored: developing new ideas, building coalitions to sell ideas, using windows of opportunity, playing multiple venues and orchestrating networks. Our discussion on the importance of each strategy and the individuals behind it is based on interviews, group discussions and a literature review. The international and political attention sparked by a series of <b>floods,</b> <b>dike</b> failure and a major cyanide spill, which preceded national elections, opened a window of opportunity for launching ideas. A new regional coalition successfully introduced floodplain rehabilitation into the water policy arena. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of a responsible civil servant who recognizes a new policy idea at an abstract level and a credible regional coalition that advocates the new idea regionally...|$|R
