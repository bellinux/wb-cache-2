The first private <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> was built in Washington County by Samuel Bowles. Minneapolis gained its first <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> in 1847.

In 2007, there were 361 farmers, most of whom relied on irrigation to some extent, nine grain banks and one <b>grain</b> <b>mill.</b> There were 311 sedentary stock owners, 115 semi-migratory and 65 practicing large-scale migration, mostly to Mali. An estimate of herd sizes gave 10,340 goats, 8,870 cattle, 1,361 camels, 652 donkeys and a few horses and sheep. There were 63 full-time retailers and 143 people practicing trade to some extent.

Flour dressers appear in water-powered mills in the United Kingdom dating to the 17th century and their use continued into the 20th Century in the UK and other countries as the <b>grain</b> <b>milling</b> industry converted from water power to steam and other forms of power to drive mill machinery.|$|R

25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the food {{producer}} or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a tenderizer.|$|E
25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
25|$|At Economy the Harmonists {{intended}} {{to become more}} involved in manufacturing and their new town on the Ohio River provided better access to eastern markets and water access {{to the south and}} west than they had in Indiana. By 1826 the Harmonists had woolen and cotton mills in operation as well as a steam-operated <b>grain</b> <b>mill.</b> The Harmonist society also ran a wine press, a hotel, post office, saw mills, stores, and a variety of farms. Here, under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. The Harmonists' competitors accused them of creating a monopoly and called on state government to dissolve the group. Despite the attacks, the Harmonists developed Economy into a prosperous factory town, engaged in farming on a large scale, and maintained a brewery, distillery, and wine-making operation. They also pioneered the manufacturing of silk in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1710, the seigneury of Montarville was conceded to Pierre Boucher, {{son of the}} {{neighboring}} seigneur of Boucherville. However, it was 30 years before the seigneury began to develop, {{due to a lack}} of navigable waterways in close enough proximity. Contrary to other seigneuries of the Montreal region, the seigneury of Saint-Bruno used water rather than wind to power its mills, which at one point numbered five and were all built between 1725 and 1816. Their hydraulic power was harnessed for grinding wheat, tanning leather, carding and spinning wool and sawing wood. The sole mill that is still standing to this day is the <b>grain</b> <b>mill,</b> rebuilt in 1761 on the site of the first mill. In 1825, the Boucher family sold the seigneury to François-Pierre Bruneau, a lawyer from Montreal who in turn passed it to his cousin, Olivier-Théophile (who was the first professor of anatomy at McGill University in 1851. On his death, in 1855, the seigneury ceased to exist.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the site}} of Beekman Park was the former Lake Amenia, a shallow, {{one and a half}} acre-wide {{freshwater}} lake in the center of Amenia. The lake first originated as a millpond for a local corn and <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> in the area. Eventually, the mill changed over to a sawmill, and during the 1920s, a dam was built in the millpond, creating Lake Amenia. The lake had two streams that flowed water {{in and out of the}} body. One ran near the local pizzeria and one ran near the current-day tennis courts. The freshwater lake became an instant tourist destination two hours north of New York City. People took advantage of the lake, including Beekman and Beekman Inc., a tourist agency developed by two brothers. They used the area around Lake Amenia to develop theaters and a living environment. The lake even had a cemetery built in one of the islands, which exists to this date as Amenia Island Cemetery. People [...] would come to the lake for vacationing, which included a pool hall in the post office, beaches, and even a brand new golf course.

2500|$|By {{the time}} the East and West rivers join, they are only just above the [...] contour. Once joined, the river flows in a northerly direction, past Fletland Mill, a former <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> which was built in 1759, and Kate's Bridge weir, where a modern bridge carries the A15 road over it. This {{bypasses}} a single-arched bridge built in the late 1700s, which has a female head carved on the keystone of the western face, presumed to be the Kate after whom the bridge is named. Beyond the bridges, the river becomes a typical Fens high level carrier, embanked {{on both sides and}} partially straightened, with counter drains {{on both sides of the}} channel, to collect seepage through the banks, as the normal water levels are higher than the surrounding land. At Tongue End the waters of the Bourne Eau join. The river below here is navigable for its last , and there was once a navigable connection to the Bourne Eau, but the Tongue End pumping station now sits between the two rivers, to aid drainage of the land to the west. The Weir Dyke drain runs along the north bank of the Bourne Eau and then the west bank of the Glen, to join the South Forty-Foot Drain near Guthram Gowt. For some distance either side of Tongue End, the Counter Drain runs a considerable distance to the east of the channel, creating washlands between them which can be flooded if water is not able to dischange from the river into the Welland estuary, as a result of the state of the tides. A little before Guthram Gowt, the Counter Drain turns to the east to reach Pode Hole pumping station, which plays an important part in the drainage of Deeping Fen.|$|E
