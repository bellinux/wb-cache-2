5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{production}} is {{an adaptation of}} {{only part of the}} novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> in anger at the squire after he has departed.|$|E

5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys it with <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn {{a desire to}} discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
25|$|During the {{broadcast}} of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities {{but also by}} slamming <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> {{on the table and}} ordering them not {{to go out to the}} pub but to stay in and watch the show.|$|E

25|$|When the Saxons {{rebelled against}} Frotho, and {{challenged}} {{him to a}} duel against Hama, Starkad unexpectedly returned and took Frotho's place in the duel.

25|$|On April 12, 2010, {{a statue}} of Puckett was {{unveiled}} at the plaza of Target Field in Minneapolis. The plaza runs up against the stadium's largest gate, Gate 34, numbered in honor of Puckett. The statue represents Puckett pumping <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> while running the bases, as he did after his winning home run in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, Morrison {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of {{criminal}} libel brought by Jamison. Judge W. S. McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> {{on his desk and}} admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, than I do this damn desk,” he shouted.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Aharon disagreed, {{maintaining}} {{that it is}} acceptable and even commendable for a Chassid to become outwardly excited during prayer. Rabbi Shneur Zalman himself was known to pound <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> so hard on the wall while praying that he sometimes literally bled from his hand. Rabbi Aharon displayed similar excitement and intensity during prayer. Moreover, he encouraged others to similarly express themselves openly during prayer.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Indian Navy divers {{recovered}} {{few items}} from the submarine and brought up six bloated bodies of Pakistani servicemen when they blasted {{their way into the}} submarine. All six servicemen were given military honorary burial by the Indian Navy. Items recovered were the back-up tapes of the radar computers, war logs, broken windshield, top secret files, as well as one of the bodies of a Petty Officer Mechanical Engineer (POME) who had a wheel spanner tightly grasped in <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> Another sailor had in his pocket a letter written in Urdu to his fiancé.|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of the Indigenous warrior in the painting—kneeling with his chin on <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> looking at General Wolfe—has been analyzed in various ways. In art, the touching of one's face with one's hand {{is a sign of}} deep thought and intelligence (thus Rodin's The Thinker). Some consider it an idealization inspired by the noble savage concept (Fryd, 75). Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying the warrior in the painting {{can be found in the}} British Museum's collection (as well as additional First Nation artefacts used in other paintings by West).|$|E

25|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF after {{backstage}} pranks and altercations with The Rougeau Brothers {{which led to}} Jacques Rougeau knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a suckerpunch (Rougeau was actually carrying a bunch of quarters in <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to make the punch harder). Billington himself, however, has claimed that the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove {{him to leave the}} WWF. Rather, he has stated, it was a dispute with WWF management over issuing of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and, to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 1940, a jostle on the Rue de Havre in Paris {{broke out}} between some Parisians and German soldiers, which {{ended with a}} man raising <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to a German sergeant, and {{which led to a}} man named Rene Bonsergent, who seems only to have been a witness to the quarrel being arrested, through just why remains a mystery to this day. On 11 November 1940, to mark the 22nd anniversary of the French victory of 1918, {{university}} students demonstrated in Paris, which were brutally put down by the Paris police. In December 1940, the Organisation civile et militaire (OCM), which consisted of army officers and civil servants was founded to provide intelligence to the Allies.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{opponent}} in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other {{with only a few}} seconds remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself. Kahn was made captain for that game due to the injury to Michael Ballack. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 for the third place (bronze) medals.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} weapons, {{the biggest change}} in TNM is that the player {{character}} can now fight with <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> and can use different gloves to augment <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> by adding different effects to his punches. Moreover, the fists can be improved by investing skill points in their respective category, which now replaces the swimming skill (which was {{considered by many to}} be fairly useless).|$|R
