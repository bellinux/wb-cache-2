40|$|A pool {{of highly}} potent {{freeze-dried}} sera from three patients with streptococcal infection has been examined by twelve laboratories in eleven countries {{and has now}} been established as the International Standard for Antistreptolysin-O by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. The main part of this collaborative study consisted in {{a comparison of the}} proposed <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> with other standard preparations. Samples of serum from eight different patients were titrated by the different laboratories. The laboratories each carried out two series of tests, one using their own streptolysin-O preparations and the other using a particular streptolysin-O preparation supplied to all the participants. There was fairly good agreement between the results from the majority of the laboratories, particularly in the tests with the same preparation of streptolysin-O. Some of the variations could be traced to the use of unsuitable streptolysin reagents. On the basis of the results, the International Unit of Antistreptolysin-O has been defined as the activity contained in 0. 0213 mg of the International Standard...|$|E
40|$|In a multicenter study, the {{consistency}} of international units expressed by five commercially available rubella virus immunoglobulin G kits was evaluated. The linearity and within-run and between-run precision were determined for each kit. All kits demonstrated good linearity and had within-run and between-run precision coefficients of variation ranging from 5. 1 to 21. 7 % and from 9. 5 to 51. 0 %, respectively. To compare the international units expressed, the results from 40 samples tested in duplicate were compared {{with the results of}} a reference enzyme immunoassay calibrated with World Health Organization <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> and a hemagglutination inhibition test. The results of the kits were plotted against those of the reference tests, and linear regression analysis was applied. The Pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 64 to 0. 75 when the commercial kit results were compared with those of the reference enzyme immunoassay, indicating only a moderate degree of correlation. Therefore, the international units expressed by the commercial kits are insufficiently consistent to be of practical use in diagnostic clinical microbiology...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{concentration}} of human serum albumin (HSA) indicates the health state {{of individuals and}} is routinely measured by UV spectroscopy with bromocresol. However, this method tends to overestimate HSA, and more critically, depends highly on the timing, in seconds, of the measure-ments. Here, we report an analog of 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein {{that can be used}} as a fluorescent sensor to quantify HSA in human sera. The accuracy of this new method proved superior to that of bromocresol when an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>serum</b> sample was analyzed. This method is more convenient than the bromocresol method because it allows for fluorescence measurements during a> 15 min period. Colorimetric analysis was also performed to further investigate the effects of the binding of the sensor to HSA. These spectroscopic studies suggest that absorption and emission changes upon HSA binding may be due to the dehydration of the dye and/or stabilization of the tritylic cation species. Albumin is a large globular protein found in largeabundance in human sera. 1 It serves many functions, including the binding of exogenous species, which may provide a detoxification mechanism. 1, 2 Quantification of albumin i...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To prevent importations of wild polioviruses into a polio free {{region a}} high level of {{population}} immunity must be kept. Standard methodology for determination of polio antibodies is a feature aimed at obtaining consistent results. An <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Serum</b> for polio antibodies exists, but no protective level in International Units is defined. Methods A representative study was carried out {{in order to determine the}} serological status against poliomyelitis in Germany (n = 2564, age 18 – 79 years). Furthermore, sera from persons aged less than 18 years were included (n = 881). Microneutralization test has been used for determination of antibody levels. Results have been expressed in International Units. Results The results of this study indicate that the cut-off level for polio antibodies is 0. 075 IU/ml for Polio 1, 0. 180 IU/ml for Polio 2 and 0. 080 IU/ml for Polio 3. Neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3 were detected in 96. 2 %, 96. 8 % and 89. 6 % of samples, respectively. Conclusions Overall, this seroprevalence indicates a very high level of immunity of the general population. It must be kept after the switch of immunization strategy from attenuated to inactivated vaccine in Germany. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{and standardized}} neutralization enzyme immunoassay (Nt-EIA) {{was developed to}} detect measles Virus growth in Vero cells and to quantify measles neutralizing antibody. Heat-inactivated sera were diluted serially 4 -fold and tested in duplicate. The 50 % reduction point (50 %RP) of virus growth was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula and the neutralizing antibody titre of test sera was converted into mIU/ml by comparing their 50 %RP {{with that of the}} <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>serum.</b> The optimal virus input and incubation time were found to be 50 - 100 plaque forming unit (PFU) /well and 64 - 72 h, respectively. The simplified Nt-EIA had a good reproducibility with only 3. 7 - 4. 2 % of duplicate tests having a ratio > 4 in an evaluation of intra assay Variation and the coefficients of variance were 2 - 9 % in an evaluation of inter assay variation. In addition, the simplified Nt-EIA had a high sensitivity (98. 6 %). specificity (100 %) and agreement (98. 8 %) in qualitative comparison with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In quantitative comparison, the correlation coefficient between Nt-EIA and PRNT was 0. 83 without log transformation or 0. 77 after log transformation and 90 % of 61 positive sera had a ratio < 4 between antibody titre tested by the two methods. The simplified Nt-EIA is thus a suitable alternative to the PRNT for the quantification of measles neutralizing antibody. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background The Sino-MONICA {{project is}} a 7 -year study {{monitoring}} trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in geographically defined populations {{in different parts of}} China. This report focuses on risk factor levels and their relations to CVD rates. Design Successive surveys on smoking habits, blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol (TC), weight and height were conducted in independent random samples of the same populations early (1987 – 1988) and late (1992 – 1993) in the study period, by the methodology and criteria of the WHO MONICA project. Associations between risk levels and CVD rates were also assessed by correlation analysis. Results In general, the mean level of BP in the populations studied was high by <b>international</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>Serum</b> TC and body mass index (BMI) were low compared with the world average. There were significant geographic variations in CVD risk levels, being higher in the north and lower in the south, which correlated with the north–south difference of CVD event rates. Conclusions The Sino-MONICA study has established the feasibility of long-term monitoring of CVD events and risk factors with international standardized methods in Chinese communities.

40|$|We {{performed}} an international proficiency study of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 serology. A common methodology for serology based on virus-like particle (VLP) ELISA {{was used by}} 10 laboratories in 6 continents. The laboratories used the same VLP reference reagent, which {{was selected as the}} most stable, sensitive and specific VLP preparation out of VLPs donated from 5 different sources. A blinded proficiency panel consisting of 52 serum samples from women with PCR-verified HPV 16 -infection, 11 control serum samples from virginal women and the WHO HPV 16 <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> (IS) <b>serum</b> were distributed. The mean plus 3 standard deviations of the negative control serum samples was the most generally useful "cut-off" criterion for distinguishing positive and negative samples. Using sensitivity of at least 50 % and a specificity of 100 % as proficiency criteria, 6 / 10 laboratories were proficient. In conclusion, an <b>international</b> <b>Standard</b> Operating Procedure for HPV serology, an international reporting system in International Units (IU) and a common "cut-off" criterion have been evaluated in an international HPV serology proficiency study...|$|R
40|$|Sera from 9 {{subjects}} with suspicion of chronic brucellosis were submitted to 7 well-known laboratories for diagnosis. They {{were free to}} select the methods. With the agglutination technique of Wright positive results were found in each serum by at least 1 of the 7 laboratories, but titers were not significant in 4 patients. For the 5 other patients significant titers were found by 1 to 3 laboratories, but 3 laboratories had frankly negative results for all samples submitted. Other methods (complement fixation test, Coombs' test, passive haemagglutination, immunofluorescence) were used {{by a number of}} participants. They tended to confirm the results of the Wright reaction in 3 out of the 5 persons with high agglutination titers. One of the patients had also a significant titer of anti-Yersinia antibodies in 1 of the 2 laboratories which performed this test. This survey confirms the necessity to standardize serological tests for the diagnosis of human brucellosis.

40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{the most}} common cause of chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism in young women. Excessive ovarian production of Anti-Müllerian Hormone, secreted by growing follicles in excess, is now considered as an important feature of PCOS. The aim of this review is first to update the current knowledge about the role of AMH in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Then, this review will discuss the improvement that serum AMH assay brings in the diagnosis of PCOS. Last, this review will explain the utility of serum AMH assay in the management of infertility in women with PCOS and its utility as a marker of treatment efficiency on PCOS symptoms. It must be emphasized however that the lack of an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for the <b>serum</b> AMH assay, mainly because of technical issues, makes it difficult to define consensual thresholds, and thus impairs the widespread use of this new ovarian marker.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{production}} of reference materials for quantifying pneumococcal antibody concentrations relies upon large scale vaccination. An alternative simple, reproducible protocol {{has been developed}} for the affinity purification of 23 serotype anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PCP) IgG immunoglobulins. Design & MethodsThe purification protocol utilised IgG fractionation, capsular polysaccharide (CPS) adsorption, and affinity chromatography using Pneumovax®-Sepharose. Purification efficiency and method reproducibility were assessed by comparison of 4 batches of anti-PCP IgG. Immunoglobulin composition was determined using nephelometry and functionality was evaluated using VaccZyme™ ELISAs. ResultsAnti-PCP IgG preparations were ≥ 95 % pure by SDS-PAGE analysis with no contaminating IgA or IgM immunoglobulins or IgG antigen specific antibodies towards haemophilus influenzae b, diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid. The predominant IgG subclass in the preparation was IgG 2. ConclusionsThis novel purification procedure produced highly specific anti-PCP IgG preparations that compared well to both Lot 89 SF and 007 sp <b>international</b> <b>serum</b> <b>standards</b> and {{could be used as}} an alternative method for the {{production of}} reference materials...|$|R
