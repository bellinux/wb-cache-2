5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this {{takes the form}} of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre {{is considered to be}} rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to create}} an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt {{to create an}} all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 {{eventually}} laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.|$|E
50|$|McAlpine {{projects}} {{where workers}} were vetted by TCA included: Colchester Garrison, shopping centres in Bristol and Leicester, an MoD project on Salisbury Plain, the M74 link road, the Quarter Mile project in Edinburgh, the Marie Curie Centre in Glasgow, and <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the Olympic Stadium.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 in {{the area}} between Yelabuga, Naberezhnye Chelny and Mendeleevsk cities the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> a huge Soviet tractor plant were started. Along with the tractor plant the engine, fuel equipment, turbochargers, foundry and forging and machine tool {{producing}} factories were planned to be built at the site.|$|R
50|$|<b>Groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the {{footbridge}} {{started in}} 2011, {{with the main}} span being lifted into place {{in the early hours}} of 15 July 2012. The bridge was formally opened in December 2012. A Park & Ride car park with 26 spaces was also opened across the line from the station at that time.|$|R
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and to lay the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> more economic involvement.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney {{laid the}} <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> a likely 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America {{political action committee}} (PAC) {{to raise money for}} other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees. A network of former staff and supporters around the nation were eager for him to run again.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> a comparative analysis of religion and society.|$|E
50|$|If {{preservation}} in situ is {{not feasible}} then PPG 16 permitted preservation by record. This involved archaeological fieldwork to excavate and record finds and features (thereby destroying them). This may involve a full excavation, further trenching in specific areas or an archaeological watching brief which involves an archaeologist monitoring <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the new development and recording any finds or features revealed as construction continue.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} several complex transfer {{problems and}} their prospective solutions within an English-to-Swedish spoken language translation system. The {{emphasis in the}} text is on transfer problems which are not lexically triggered, concentrating mainly on the translation of differences in mood and tense. Laying the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the translation part, the treatment of verb-phrase syntax and semantics is described in detail. The paper also shortly discusses some lexically triggered complex transfer problems...|$|R
5000|$|Some historians see {{the traditions}} of tsarist autocracy as {{partially}} responsible <b>for</b> laying <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the totalitarianism in the Soviet Union. They see {{the traditions of}} autocracy and patrimonialism as dominating Russia's political culture for centuries; for example, Stephen White wrote that Russian political culture is [...] "rooted in the historical experience of centuries of absolutism." [...] Those views had been challenged by other historians, for example, Nicolai N. Petro and Martin Malia (as cited by Hoffmann).|$|R
5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Henry Neilson Wrigley, CBE, DFC, AFC (21April 1892– 14September 1987) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, and afterwards laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the RAAF's air power doctrine. During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his 1919 cross-country flight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} a medieval rabbit warren were {{unearthed}} in 2004. when the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> a new spa extension to the hotel were being excavated. An underground tunnel was found extending at least 100 metres beneath the main manor house garden terrace. The tunnel is intact as of 2004, but {{has not yet been}} fully explored. Earth bore tunnels of this type are sometimes associated with High Middle Ages abbeys, palaces, and castles as secret escape routes if the site were under siege.|$|R
50|$|Butter Project {{was created}} as a split from Popcorn Time when the latter met legal {{difficulties}} — with Butter Project aiming to retain development of only expressly legal and permissible portions of the code-base, relating to video-streaming. The developers have asserted Butter Project will not use any of the popcorntime.io infrastructure. Butter Project is not aimed at allowing copyright infringement, but aims to build the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> streaming video over BitTorrent. By having a legal portion which remains on GitHub the creators hope they can get more developers involved.|$|R
40|$|In January 2007 a {{programme}} {{of archaeological}} investigation {{was carried out}} at Granary Wharf, Leeds (NGR SE 2975 3320) by Birmingham Archaeology for Scott Wilson on behalf of Isis Waterside Regeneration. The archaeological recording was carried out prior to the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> a mixed-use redevelopment of the site. Three trenches were excavated in the car park and hard-standing of Granary Wharf. The purpose {{of the project was}} to assess the character and state of the remains of three wooden sheds that occupied the site during the 19 th century...|$|R
5|$|During his career, Martin {{has also}} served as a major {{influence}} {{in the development of the}} sport of curling, establishing the competitive tier in the sport and setting the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the management of curling teams and the creation of high-level competitive curling events. He is also known for contributing to the growth of curling, long known as a recreational and participant-based sport, as a spectator sport. Martin retired from competitive curling in 2014.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was {{the basis of his}} attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the {{incorporation}} {{of many of the}} guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the area}} of Central Europe, and {{especially}} in the Czech Republic (and former Czechoslovakia), geobiocoenological landscape differentiation has been applied for more than 40 years to create a spatial model of the natural (potential) condition of geobiocoenoses in the landscape. Because long-term objective of geobiocoenology is to contribute to the creation of harmonic cultural landscape by gradual development of a comprehensive system of <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> sustainable landscape use, and as Mendel University experts work in various countries, adaptions of geobiocoenology were used also outside Europe, in tropical areas. Examples of such a work could be shown on islands such as Socotra (belonging politically to Yemen), Tasmania, and Cuba...|$|R
50|$|The {{stands of}} the Kirov stadium were {{located on the}} slopes of a {{circular}} artificial mound {{in the western part of}} Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction.|$|R
5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} to rage in the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> this project.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes. Although Petty provided much of the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Cantillon's Essai, Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's influence has been overstated. Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke, Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard. Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight {{on the relationship between}} increases in the supply of money, price, and production.|$|E
5|$|Petén {{was first}} {{penetrated}} by Hernán Cortés with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory {{from north to}} south in 1525. In {{the first half of the}} 16th century, Spain established neighbouring colonies in Yucatán to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of Mérida in Yucatán.|$|E
50|$|The National Liberals' {{period of}} great {{dominance}} was between 1871 and 1879, {{when they were}} Bismarck's chief allies in the Reichstag, and were avid supporters of the Kulturkampf measures. The stabilization of the new state was in a large degree only feasible because of National Liberal party support and guidance of Bismarck´s domestic policies, {{especially in regards to}} national economics and the legal foundations of the second German empire. Weights and measurements were standardized, a common German market and a national bank, the Reichsbank, created and the numerous regional currencies replaced with the Reichsmark. The liberal economic policies, although temporarily unpopular in the recession of the 1870s, laid the <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> the economic boom the German nation experienced {{at the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, laying the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after {{the discovery of the}} first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E
5|$|The Uranium Committee was a {{committee}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) that succeeded the Advisory Committee on Uranium and later evolved into the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), when that organization absorbed the NDRC in June 1941, and the S-1 Executive Committee in June 1942. It laid the <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Manhattan Project by initiating and coordinating the early research efforts in the United States, and liaising with the Tube Alloys Project in Britain.|$|E
