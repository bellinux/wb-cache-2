500|$|Sheen {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995, and began living together shortly afterwards. Their daughter, Lily Mo Beckinsale-Sheen, was born in 1999 in London, England. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> married. Their relationship ended in January 2003, soon after the couple moved to Los Angeles from London. Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in Underworld; but while on set, she and Wiseman fell in love, and subsequently married in 2004. Sheen has said he continues to live in Los Angeles to be close to his daughter. He remains friends with Beckinsale. [...] "We were very lucky in that we didn't have an acrimonious split," [...] Beckinsale has said. [...] "We are still very close and [...] sees us around each other." [...] "He's absolutely one of my most favourite people ever." [...] "I love him dearly—I would miss him dreadfully if he wasn't in my life." [...] Sheen has said that Beckinsale [...] "will always {{be one of the most}} important people in my life. I have real love for her." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{setting is}} wonderful, Ms. Carl {{describes}} {{the village of}} Somerstowe and the English climate so well that this reader <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> viewing a film. The characters, both major as well as minor, come to life clearly with all their traits, quirks, and foibles helping the reader understand some of their actions. The mystery kept me guessing until the last few chapters where I had an [...] "AHA! moment" [...] just as I suspect the author intended.|$|E
60|$|The house {{whirled around}} {{two or three}} times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> going up in a balloon.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Eddy <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{was neither}} Syrian nor American. The only times Eddy visited the United States {{was for her}} {{schooling}} and for her health treatments. Although she was more at home in Syria, she still at times held Syrians in contempt. Until her death, Eddy <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had [...] "no home" [...] on Earth. Rather, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had a calling to evangelize and heal before reaching her home in heaven.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not till}} Sunday that Lilias <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{could ever be}} comforted. Her heart was indeed ready to break as she walked {{at the head of}} the school {{children}} behind the white-covered coffin, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not deserve to dwell upon the child's present happiness; but afterwards she was relieved by joining in prayer for the pardon of our sins and negligences, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was forgiven, at least by man, when she joined with Mrs. Eden in the appointed feast of Easter Day.|$|R
5000|$|Isabelle had {{developed}} the eating disorder of bulimia nervosa {{due to her}} problems with coping. Her father had died two years prior to her eating disorder. Isabelle <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could not deal or cope with her father’s death. This was because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{did not have the}} full support of her mother because her mom stayed in her bed depressed. Problems coping with death or things that are stressful are linked as onsets to eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa in Isabelle’s case. [...] Her eating disorder was the only way <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could control what was taking place in her life, since she could not control the death of her father. :( ...|$|R
60|$|She stopped, quivering. Betty {{was cold}} with a nameless dismay. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{standing}} in the dark {{on the brink of}} an abyss.|$|E
6000|$|Rilla <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> in some fantastic nightmare. Were {{these the}} people who, three weeks ago, were talking of crops and prices and local gossip? ...|$|E
60|$|Sara Stanley wore a smart new {{travelling}} {{suit and}} a blue felt hat with a white feather. She looked so horribly grown up in it that we <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> lost to us already.|$|E
60|$|Carol {{was so much}} {{pleased that}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> must talk to somebody, so she turned to Ruth.|$|R
50|$|Fired: Patti Newton- {{for asking}} to be fired because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could not bring anymore to the competition.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> must hazard a {{few words}} more--'Can you guess {{what he will do}} if Mr. Ponsonby's reports prove true?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{suppose she}} would have grieved much if he had," [...] said Clemantiny sarcastically, all the while {{watching}} Chester, until he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> boring into his very soul and reading all his past life.|$|E
6000|$|... "No one but I," [...] said Catherine, who <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{making the}} most presumptuous speech of her life, {{and yet at the}} same time had an {{instinct}} that she was right in doing so.|$|E
60|$|When {{the emperor}} was fast asleep, the bed began to crack loudly, {{and to the}} empress each crack had a meaning. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{listening}} to a language which no one but herself could understand.|$|E
60|$|And Maurice's eyes sparkled, and Lucy {{looked at}} the clear, stern glory of the {{mountain}} points, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> understood him.|$|R
6000|$|Violet <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had spoken}} presumptuously, and said, 'Lady Elizabeth {{has been so}} very kind to me. Emma is my baby's godmother.' ...|$|R
60|$|Try as <b>she</b> might, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had had a}} blow which {{knocked her}} down. She felt {{she had had a}} blow.|$|R
60|$|When he {{went away}} again the {{children}} retired to various places to weep alone. Morel went to bed in misery, and Mrs. Morel <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> numbed by some drug, as if her feelings were paralysed. She loved him passionately.|$|E
6000|$|So spoke Sydney Evelyn in her girlish prejudice, and the {{prospects}} that had recently seemed to Lucas so fair and kindly, suddenly clouded over and became dull, gloomy, and despicable. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> saving him from becoming a deserter as she went on—- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} dark, {{and the wind}} howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.|$|E
60|$|Virginia trembled, a cold shudder {{ran through}} her, {{and for a}} few moments there was silence. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was in a terrible dream.|$|R
60|$|Happily {{there was}} an interruption. Cherry <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had had {{a taste of the}} claws; but she feared she had been malicious, and she was penitent.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had signed}} and sealed this letter <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had torn out {{a chapter of}} her young life and thrown it upon the fire.|$|R
60|$|She was {{the first}} to step back, to recoil before the ironical {{intensity}} of that fixed gaze. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> in a dream, as if a nightmare assailed her, which in her wakeful hours would be dissipated by reason, by common sense, by sound and sober fact.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked with}} their bodies moving in complex unity, close together. He held her hand, and they went the long way round by the road, to be farther. Always she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{supported}} off her feet, as if her feet were light as little breezes in motion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not yours}} yet," [...] began Rose, much moved, though {{all the while}} she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> on a stage and had a part to play, for Charlie had made life so like a melodrama {{that it was hard}} for him to be quite simple even when most sincere.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{could almost}} hear them talking it over and vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, Charlie is not.' She sprung out, {{holding his}} hand, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could {{never forget that}} moment when her new brother first kissed her brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now do {{tell all}} about it," [...] cried Jill, who was pining {{to know the}} whole story, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{earned the right to}} hear it.|$|R
60|$|He shifted {{slightly}} on the hearth, crunching a cinder under his heel. He {{looked down at}} it. Gudrun {{was aware of the}} beautiful old marble panels of the fireplace, swelling softly carved, round him and above him. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> caught at last by fate, imprisoned in some horrible and fatal trap.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{thought was}} {{suspended}} while she listened attentively {{for the return}} of the yacht's boat. She was dismayed at the task before her. Not a sound broke the stillness and she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> lost in empty space. Then suddenly someone amidships yawned immensely and said: [...] "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" [...] A voice asked: [...] "Ain't they back yet?" [...] A negative grunt answered.|$|E
60|$|Down {{the room}} {{she heard the}} rapid firing of questions. She stood before her class {{not knowing what to}} do. She waited painfully. Her block of children, fifty unknown faces, watched her, hostile, ready to jeer. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> in torture over a fire of faces. And on every side she was naked to them. Of unutterable length and torture the seconds went by.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, my dear,' said Mrs. Edmonstone, 'I see {{no reason}} against it. But--' and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was making a desperate plunge, 'there is {{something}} I {{want to say to}} you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Sophy {{was rather}} frightened, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had done wrong in talking of oranges. She {{did not know}} what to say, and only got out {{something}} about Johnnie and a comfort.|$|R
6000|$|Honor leant {{back with}} folded hands and closed eyes, so that Phoebe almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had killed her. 'I suppose Robert {{was right to}} fetch him,' she said; 'but their telling you!' ...|$|R
