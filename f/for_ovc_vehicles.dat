40|$|The {{escalation}} of HIV/AIDS has posed great {{challenge to the}} community. AIDS has killed {{a number of people}} while leaving behind Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs). Due to loss of parents, OVCs have become helpless while assuming responsibilities above their age such as care for sick parents in the community. Traditionally, care and support <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> was a community responsibility. The Community provided services such as: food, shelter, clothing and parental care. However, with increased number of OVCs and rampant poverty, the community has ceased to offer the expected quality s services. So, OVCs are longer receiving proper attention in the community. The family which is crucial for sustainable care and support <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> has been given less attention by the government, NGOs, and other stakeholders. As a result, risks of maltreatment of OVCs in families have increased. The risks affect growth and development of OVCs. Therefore, the study highlights the position and status of OVCs by exploring the factors which affect the provision of support and care <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> in the community.

This paper compares the results of full-scale pumping tests on SCC with literature results <b>for</b> <b>OVC.</b> It is shown that the velocity profiles are different <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> and SCC, as SCC is also sheared in the pipes. Bends cause additional pressure losses which appear to be higher in case of SCC, but no final conclusion can be drawn due to the large scatter on the results. The air content increases and the air bubbles size decreases in case of SCC, which is completely opposite compared to OVC.

(Social Work) A lack of {{national}} policy and indicators {{to monitor and}} evaluate {{the implementation of the}} developmental approach in the welfare field (specifically in child welfare) continues to be a challenge (Patel, Grobbelaar, Selipsky, & Curtis, 2011). There are no appropriate guidelines and procedures to evaluate new policy and approaches to child welfare practice, such as the community-based approach to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs). Orphans constitute approximately 3. 54 million of South Africa’s total population (Mathews, Jameison, Lake, & Smith, 2014, p. 92) and there is {{an increase in the number}} of vulnerable children, that is, those living in circumstances that deter holistic development (Fluke & Wulczyn, 2010; Mathews et al., 2014). These circumstances, together with the paucity of empirical research on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to inform community-based services <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> informed this study. Therefore, this study intended to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the M&E system in a child welfare agency rendering community-based services <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> and to make recommendations on how the system might be improved. In order to achieve this, a number of objectives were linked to this goal. The first objective was to conduct a situation analysis of the M&E system in a specific child welfare agency. Second, was to evaluate what works and what does not work in the implementation of the agency’s design and the utilization of the agency’s data.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{qualitative}} study explores the day-to-day care experiences and livelihoods {{challenges of the}} elderly carers of orphan and vulnerable children (OVCs) in rural Chiradzuru district in Malawi. The study aims to highlight the impact of AIDS mortality on Elderly Households’ livelihood assets. METHOD: Using case study approach data was collected from 43 cases comprised of 23 individuals and 3 Focus Groups. The main study participants were elderly-headed households caring <b>for</b> <b>OVCs.</b> Data was collected and the evidence converged using the Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF) to analyse findings. FINDINGS: The main ten study participants were between the ages 55 - 90 + caring for thirty-eight OVCs; seven of whom were single females caring <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> aged between 2 - 16 years old-some of them caring for second generation of orphans(great grandchildren). Although this is crisis-led fostering, most of the elderly have accepted the responsibility regardless of their capabilities. This highlights the value of family based care in these families. Six of the ten elderly carers had lost {{a significant number of}} assets to AIDS sickness and death of family members. A few had given up their wage earning livelihoods to care <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> while <b>for</b> the very old (71 - 90) their physical old-age disabilities affected pursuance of livelihoods impacting their food security and acquisition of basic needs. There was mutual reciprocity between the OVCs and their carers to pursue livelihoods which increased household resilience.

40|$|Abstract Ovarian cancer (OVC) is {{the fourth}} leading cause of cancer {{mortality}} among women in Europe and the United States. Its early detection is difficult {{due to the lack}} of specificity of clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, late diagno-sis is a major contributor to the poor survival rates <b>for</b> <b>OVC,</b> which can be attributed to the lack of specific sets of markers. Aside from patients sharing a strong family history of ovarian and breast cancer, including the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 tumor suppressor genes mutations, the most used biomarker is the Cancer-antigen 125 (CA- 125). CA- 125 has a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 97 % in epithelial cancer (stage III or IV). However, its sensitivity is 30 % in stage I cancer, as its increase is linked to several physiological phenomena and benign situations. CA- 125 is particularly useful for at-risk population diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. It is clear that alone, CA- 125 is inadequate as a biomarker <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> diagnosis. There is an unmet need to identify additional biomarkers. Novel and more sensitive pro-teomic strategies such as MALDI mass spectrometry imaging studies are well suited to identify better markers for both diagnosis and prognosis. In the present review, we will focus on such proteomic strategies in regards to OVC signaling pathways, OVC development and escape from the immune response...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Early {{diagnosis}} of children living with HIV {{is a prerequisite}} for accessing timely paediatric HIV care and treatment services and for optimizing treatment outcomes. Testing of HIV-exposed infants at 6 weeks and later is part of the national prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV programme in Zimbabwe, but many opportunities to test infants and children are being missed. Early childhood development (ECD) playcentres can act as an entry point providing multiple health and social services for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) under 5 years, including facilitating access to HIV treatment and care. Methods: Sixteen rural community-based, community-run ECD playcentres were established to provide health, nutritional and psychosocial support <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> aged 5 years and younger exposed to or living with HIV, coupled with family support groups (FSGs) for their families/caregivers. These centres were located in close proximity to health centres giving access to nurse-led monitoring of 697 OVC and their caregivers. Community mobilisers identified OVC within the community, supported their registration process and followed up defaulters. Records profiling each child&#x 0027;s attendance, development and health status (including illness episodes), vaccinations and HIV status were compiled at the playcentres and regularly reviewed, updated and acted upon by nurse supervisors. Through FSGs, community cadres and a range of officers from local services established linkages and built the capacity of parents/caregivers and communities to provide protection, aid psychosocial development and facilitate referral for treatment and support. Results: Available data as of September 2011 for 16 rural centres indicate that 58. 8 % (n= 410) of the 697 children attending the centres were tested for HIV; 18 % (n= 74) tested positive and were initiated on antibiotic prophylaxis. All those deemed eligible for antiretroviral therapy were commenced on treatment and adherence was monitored. Conclusions: This community-based playcentre model strengthens comprehensive care (improving emotional, cognitive and physical development) <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> younger than 5 years and provides opportunities for caregivers to access testing, care and treatment for children exposed to, affected by and infected with HIV in a secure and supportive environment.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} collaborative efforts between World Vision Ethiopia (WVE) and Wisdom Micro financing Institution, S. C. (WISDOM) to provide caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in Ethiopia with microfinance. Because {{of the millions}} of new OVCs being created every year, many have thought that microfinance could be an effective tool to mitigate the negative effects of loss <b>for</b> <b>OVCs.</b> Nevertheless, because OVC households can often be targets of stigmatization and can have lower levels of social capital, the heavy dependence of microfinance on mechanisms that use social capital can consequently work to exclude many OVC households.; Despite the assumptions of the staff working for WVE and WISDOM concerning the capacity of OVC caregivers to participate in microfinance, it was the collaborative efforts between WVE community workers with WISDOM staff that resulted in the inclusion of more OVC caregivers in WISDOM loans. Furthermore, it was the observations of the positive impact that WISDOM was having on the community in general that showed to be the biggest factor in motivating WVE community workers to collaborate with WISDOM in their lending processes. The result was, in a comparison among newer and older borrowers of WISDOM, in addition to eating more and attending school more often, OVCs in households who had been participating in WISDOM for over a year fared better in psychosocial measures as well. Thus, the potential of microfinance to mitigate the negative effects of loss <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> is substantial.; The irony of this particular case was that both the ability of WVE community workers to include more OVC caregivers in WISDOM and the success of OVC caregivers in microfinance occurred without either organization being aware of it. As a result, collaborative efforts between the two organizations weakened in recent years while false assumptions concerning the separate needs of different populations among the poor were never challenged.; However, despite the two organizations' different missions, their work was not separate. WVE services may have actually been working to prepare many households in the community to participate in higher forms of economic development, such as microfinance, demonstrating the importance of collaboration and integrated models for development work...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} {{to contribute to the}} existing body of knowledge relative to social protection of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC). It proffers recommendations on sustainable assistance mechanisms which will ensure effective support systems for improved quality of life <b>for</b> <b>OVCs.</b> The impacts of orphanhood and other vulnerability issues on children directly challenge social protection systems and how they support the wellbeing of the children. This presents grave threat to social and economic development as well as the wellbeing of children. Child Support Grant (CSG) is one of South Africa’s largest social protection programmes targeting vulnerable children. The effectiveness of the grants in addressing the concerns of the children is greatly dependent on how it is utilised. The aim of this study is for a review of the support systems <b>for</b> <b>OVCs</b> in South Africa, within the context of social grants to determine its viability to address the challenges of vulnerability. The study is informed by empowerment framework as theoretical paradigm; which postulates that people need to be empowered through sustainable programmes that enhance their capacities to realize their full potentials and become self-sufficient. The study reviewed and appraised relevant approaches that aid empowering OVCs {{in order to ensure that}} they are supported to move from state of helplessness to an empowered state. A quantitative research method was used for the survey, data analysis and review. A case study approach was adopted for the study. The population of this study consisted of selected families of OVCs and community volunteers in Port St. Johns and Ndlambe local municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province. The study findings show that the CSG is relevant in the context of providing the needed support <b>for</b> the <b>OVCs,</b> which will enhance their wellbeing and development. It identified CSG as a mechanism which supports the concept of ensuring that OVCs have an adult caregiver who supports them. It shows that the CSG is able to reduce the number of OVCs without an adult caregiver. xii The study identified that many of the caregivers of the OVCs do not have other source of income and this affects their utilisation of the grant to attend to the needs of the children such as caregivers who do not support the wellbeing of the children though they receive CSG. The findings did not identify many challenges with the functioning and management of the CSG scheme. The concerns identified by the study are related to challenges of accessing the grant. The findings show that the caregivers do not encounter obstacles while applying for CSG for reasons related to the fact that some of them are being assisted. It shows that most children that are eligible but are not receiving CSG were for reasons such as caregiver not applying on time for the child or lack of documents required for the application. The study further noted that it was mostly caregivers that were not assisted during the applications process that experienced difficulties. The study observed that supporting the needed infrastructure in resource constrained environment is necessary to assist the children. Building facilities for banking, health care, and recreation as well as educational facilities such as libraries and computer centres were identified as relevant in schemes that aim to improve the quality of lives of children. The study findings revealed that hunger and deprivation could be a defining factor, which influences a child’s interest in education. It concludes that the provision of CSG to families could have strong influence in determining children’s interest in education. The study identified other support systems in the community that complement the CSG mechanism. The supports includes the assistance to process the application for CSG as well as guidance in the utilisation of the grant; after school care programme which provides opportunity for children to receive additional educational support; and material assistance <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> families. The supports were mostly through community volunteers of organisations in the communities.

The goal was to determine whether direct scholarship aid to individual students versus various forms of block grants would be more effective in promoting lower rates of absenteeism, lower dropout rates, higher national examination scores, and higher pass rates <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> of both genders. Insufficient evidence was available for recipients of scholarships, but OVC with block grant support performed as well or better than their non-OVC counterparts, and significantly better than OVC without support. Contrary to popular belief, girls had lower rates of absenteeism. There were no gender differences in dropout. However, boys consistently outperformed girls on academic tests. Insufficient data systems continue to impede more detailed analysis...|$|R
40|$|The high {{prevalence}} of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome in sub-Saharan Africa {{has resulted in}} a dramatic increase in orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) over the past decade. These children typically rely on extended family networks for support, but the magnitude of the crisis has resulted in traditional familial networks becoming overwhelmed and more economically and socially vulnerable. Previous research consistently demonstrates the positive influence of household asset ownership on children's well-being. Using data from impoverished households caring <b>for</b> <b>OVC</b> in rural Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe, this study explores the influence of household asset ownership on OVC health vulnerability (HV) and social vulnerability (SV). Findings indicate that asset ownership is associated with significantly lower SV, in terms of school attendance and birth registration. Yet, assets do not emerge as a direct influence of OVC HV as measured by disease and chronic illness, although having a chronically ill adult in the household increases HV. These findings suggest that asset ownership, specifically a combination of fixed and movable assets, may offset the influence of other risk factors for children's SV...|$|R
