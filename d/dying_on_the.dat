5|$|For its part, the Polish army marched {{across the}} Dniester into Moldavia in August 1497. The Sultan sent 500 or 600 Janissaries to Moldavia at Stephen's request, joining the Moldavian forces {{gathered}} at Roman. Stephen sent his chancellor, Isaac, to John Albert, requesting {{the withdrawal of}} Polish forces from Moldavia, but John Albert had Isaac imprisoned. The Poles then laid siege to Suceava on 24 September. The campaign failed: Teutonic reinforcements never arrived, with Johann von Tiefen <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way. Before long, a plague {{broke out in the}} Polish camp, while Vladislaus of Hungary sent an army of 12,000 strong to Moldavia, forcing John Albert to lift the siege on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E
5|$|At age 20, Curb {{appointed}} Lloyd {{vice-president of}} MGM Records. In the 1970s, {{he became a}} successful record producer for teen idols, including the Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy, and Leif Garrett. In 1986, he was music supervisor for the soundtrack of the film Dirty Dancing, and {{has been involved in}} several other movie soundtracks well into the 2000s. Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd to release Harris's self-titled debut solo album in 1973, which explored his country rock influences. Later on, he became the president of Barry Manilow's publishing company and most recently Harris has written a play about his life. Although Danny Harris was initially disillusioned with the music industry, he recorded the gospel album Thank Him Every Day in 1980. He also worked as a folk musician and actor before <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set of Saving Mr. Banks from a heart attack on October 1, 2012.

25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank of the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down on the couch and resigns himself to this fate (apparently <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E
25|$|The Marines, {{believing the}} island was safe, were caught off guard by the attack. The gunfire by the two assailants struck the two baseball-playing Marines {{as well as a}} tent and dozens of cases of soft drinks. After {{shooting}} at the Marines initially, reports state the men then drove to another location and then shot again. According to accounts, a Marine sentry returned fire with an M16A2 rifle and company commander Captain Matthew S. Reid returned fire with a sidearm, with the former's gunfire disabling the truck. The two Kuwaiti gunmen were shot, with one of them exiting the vehicle on the passenger side with several gunshot wounds. Reid and the senior-most Marine enlisted on the island, First Sergeant Timothy Ruff, and Company Gunnery Sergeant Wayne A. Hertz then closed with and shot the gunman several more times, killing them. Ruff and other Marines, including Hertz, then extracted the wounded driver of the truck from out of the vehicle. That gunman also died. Before the second gunman died, the Marines walked up to his body and stood over him. Surrounded by U.S. Marines, the mortally-wounded gunman laid <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and muttered a few phrases in Arabic before finally expiring.|$|E

No one believes his story that the invasion is doomed. Cage repeats the loop of <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach and waking at Heathrow over and over again, becoming more skilled in combat and learning to predict events {{that have yet to}} happen.

500|$|Although Vaughan {{has written}} for television, and has {{endeavored}} to have his previous works adapted into film, he stresses that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book {{and not to be}} adapted to other media, explaining [...] "I wanted to do something that was way too expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown-up to be a four-quadrant blockbuster." [...] Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead, having written the first six issues as the first story arc, which would have ended with the two main characters <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful.

500|$|Górecki now had two texts: {{one from}} a mother to her son, the other from a {{daughter}} to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from {{the southern city of}} Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cross: [...] "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother..." [...] (Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany...). Górecki said, [...] "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony [...] "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.|$|E

500|$|Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy {{explains}} to Kathy {{that he has}} been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, [...] "we all complete".|$|E
500|$|For the U.S. and its allies, {{the victory}} in the Tenaru battle was psychologically {{significant}} in that Allied soldiers, {{after a series of}} defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. [...] The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. On this subject Vandegrift remarked, [...] "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." [...] Robert Leckie, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book Helmet For My Pillow, [...] "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, as though they had not died singly but in groups. Moving among them were the souvenir hunters, picking their way delicately as though fearful of booby traps, while stripping the bodies of their possessions." ...|$|E
500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce <b>dying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.
