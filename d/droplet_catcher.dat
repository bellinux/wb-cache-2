50|$|In a {{mechanical}} compression chiller technology, the coolant {{is circulated through}} a chilling coil heat exchanger that is inserted in the filter house, downstream from the filtering stage. Downstream from the coil, a <b>droplet</b> <b>catcher</b> is installed to collect moisture and water drops. The mechanical chiller can increase the turbine output and performance better than wetted technologies {{due to the fact}} that inlet air can be chilled below the wet bulb temperature, indifferent to the weather conditions. Compression chiller equipment has higher electricity consumption than evaporative systems. Initial capital cost is also higher, however turbine power augmentation and efficiency is maximized, and the extra-cost is amortized due to increased output power.|$|E
