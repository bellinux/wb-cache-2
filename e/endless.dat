5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of <b>Endless</b> Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of <b>Endless</b> Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th {{century in}} the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and {{mechanical}} engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City. It incorporated an escapement mechanism {{as well as the}} earliest known <b>endless</b> power-transmitting chain drive, which drove the armillary sphere.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: <b>Endless</b> Idaho and My Own Private River. <b>Endless</b> Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|Jackson edited unused {{material}} from the Division Bell sessions, described by Mason as ambient music, into an hour-long composition tentatively titled The Big Spliff, but Pink Floyd decided not to release it. Some of The Big Spliff was used to create the band's final album, The <b>Endless</b> River (2014).|$|E
5|$|Mme M'Barek further {{stated that}} the {{arguments}} she had with her husband {{had nothing to do}} with money, but rather arose as a result of Lord Shaftesbury's excessive sexual demands brought on by his seemingly <b>endless</b> injections of testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second arrival to power, Tătărescu became noted for the {{enthusiastic}} support {{he gave to}} the modernist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși's The <b>Endless</b> Column complex in Târgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).|$|E
5|$|The Division Bell reached {{number one}} in the UK and the US but {{received}} mixed reviews. It was followed by a tour of the US and Europe. It was certified double platinum in the US the year it was released, and triple platinum in 1999. Unused material from the Division Bell sessions became part of Pink Floyd's next and final album, The <b>Endless</b> River (2014).|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} no pause feature or motion controls, {{and there is}} no formal tutorial. Hidden between the puzzles are a few ciphers—incomprehensible text to be decoded through {{substitution}} cipher and other methods. The <b>endless</b> mode unlocks when the 100 puzzles are complete, and features a series of randomly generated levels.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{for both}} the state and federal exchanges was troubled due to {{management}} and technical failings. HealthCare.gov, the website that offers insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered <b>endless</b> problems. Operations stabilized in 2014, although not all planned features were complete.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} of The Sandman is Dream, {{also known as}} Morpheus and other names, {{who is one of}} the seven <b>Endless.</b> The other <b>Endless</b> are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight) and Destruction. The series is famous for Gaiman's trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. The Sandman is a story about stories and how Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. The Sandman was Vertigo's flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase, in a black-and-white Annotated edition, and is available for digital download.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} of <b>endless</b> dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated. The topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (equivalently, <b>endless</b> trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new {{locations}} were rarely introduced. The first four seasons {{of the show}} are set during a seemingly <b>endless</b> summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior {{high school in the}} fall and winter months.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive <b>endless</b> entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 <b>endless</b> runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} {{moves to the}} right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps the screen to jump and perform tricks, and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with <b>endless</b> subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the <b>endless</b> farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|During Paramount ownership, {{the theatre}} {{was known as}} Paramount Theatre. Eventually, the Paramount Theatre stage was {{converted}} to an artificial ice surface, and renamed Wonderland Theatre. Two ice shows were presented, titled <b>Endless</b> Summer on Ice (2007–2009) and Snoopy Rocks! on Ice (2010–2011). The first production included Scooby-Doo and outfits like s'mores, while Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus appeared in sequences of the latter. The show appeared at various other former Paramount Parks, and in each situation, the sequenced did vary between the Scooby-anchored and Peanuts-anchored productions.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the <b>Endless,</b> and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an <b>endless</b> loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Stardock {{released}} {{a remake of}} Galactic Civilizations, which was praised by reviewers who saw the game {{as a replacement for}} the Master of Orion series. In 2004 the Creative Assembly released the critically acclaimed , which has spawned many sequels. Civilization IV was {{released a}}t the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including GameSpot and GameSpy. It is now considered one of the greatest computer games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by IGN. By 2008, the Civilization series had sold over eight million copies, followed the release of Civilization Revolution for game consoles soon after, Civilization V in 2010, and Civilization VI in 2016. Meanwhile, Stardock released , which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy. Additionally, French developer Amplitude Studios released both <b>Endless</b> Space and <b>Endless</b> Legend. These successes have led Stardock's Brad Wardell to assert that 4X games have excellent growth potential, particularly among less hardcore players. This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported free software releases such as Freeciv, FreeCol, Freeorion, Golden Age of Civilizations, and C-evo.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an <b>endless</b> diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Kenney Jones {{replaced}} Moon and {{the group}} resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25thanniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–1997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, {{plans for a new}} album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing <b>Endless</b> Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, follow-up The Fragile, and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an <b>endless</b> dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2014, Team Meat {{announced}} that a sequel, Super Meat Boy: Forever, was in development for smartphones, tablets, and Steam. Forever is styled as an <b>endless</b> runner, though the player has additional abilities, such as combat controls, to complete levels. Levels themselves are dynamically built based on the difficulty level, and get progressively more difficult as the player completes them. The game was confirmed for release in 2018 on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android systems in August 2017.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} have preached Jainism far and wide. At his death, he {{attained}} Nirvana kalyanaka (also called Moksha), {{all four}} of his ghati karma were destroyed, his soul was liberated from the <b>endless</b> cycle of rebirths, to stay eternally at siddhaloka. His death is believed in Jainism to have occurred on Ashtapada (also known as Mount Kailash) on the fourteenth day of Magha Krishna (Hindu Calendar) at the age of 84 lakh purva years, with three years and eight and a half months remaining of the third ara.|$|E
5|$|Robert is a {{young boy}} who suffers from {{mathematical}} anxiety due to his boredom in school. His mother is Mrs. Wilson. He also experiences recurring dreams—including falling down an <b>endless</b> slide or being eaten by a giant fish—but is interrupted from this sleep habit one night by a small devil creature who introduces himself as the Number Devil. Although there are many Number Devils (from Number Heaven), Robert only knows him as the Number Devil before learning of his actual name, Teplotaxl, later in the story.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 (also {{referred}} to as Robotron) is an arcade video game developed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar of Vid Kidz and released by Williams Electronics (part of WMS Industries) in 1982. It is a shoot 'em up with two-dimensional graphics. The game {{is set in the}} year 2084 in a fictional world where robots have turned against humans in a cybernetic revolt. The aim is to defeat <b>endless</b> waves of robots, rescue surviving humans, and earn as many points as possible.|$|E
