5|$|In {{a series}} of flashbacks, Karman's life is told. He lost his pro-Dutch father during the Indonesian National Revolution and was raised in poverty before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the rich {{merchant}} Haji Bakir as a child, babysitting his daughter Rifah. In the two years Karman lived with them, the family raised {{him to be a}} devout Muslim; Karman, for his part, was a diligent worker and cared deeply for Rifah. When his uncle returned from the front, Karman was brought back home and educated until junior high school, dropping out for a lack of funds. When he was in his twenties Karman found a job at the local village chief's office {{with the help of a}} civil employee named Triman and a teacher named Margo.|$|E
25|$|After {{his time}} at Harvard Business School, Spahr {{returned}} to Bartlesville for roughly six months before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Standard Oil in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained for the next 38 years. His first position was that of Pipeline Designer.|$|E
25|$|Walter's death {{caused a}} decline in wrestling, not only in New Zealand, but for the entire Australasian region as {{appearances}} from foreign wrestlers declined to only a few each year. Rickard and John da Silva, who ran the rival Central Wrestling Alliance, sought {{to develop their own}} stars during early to mid-1960s such as Al Hobman, Tony Garea, Peter Maivia, and The Sheepherders. He and fellow wrestler Joe Komone also discovered future Australian heavyweight champion Earl Black and who spent his rookie year for Rickard in Wellington before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Australian promoters Hal Morgan and Jim Barnett in Sydney.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, {{and if they had}} to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|When a person’s {{capabilities}} are lowered, {{they are in}} some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn {{as much as a}} healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> fear of their lives. As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid. To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.|$|E
25|$|Rodney Charlton Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst) — Rodney is Del's younger brother, {{and is more}} academically gifted, {{although}} {{only to the extent}} of two GCEs. Orphaned when young, Rodney was raised by Del. His principal role throughout the show was as Del's lackey and sidekick. Much of the conflict between the two came from Rodney's dislike of his reliance on Del, and his unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or by setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> her father. In contrast to Del Boy, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences; he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.|$|E

25|$|In their summation, the {{prosecution}} {{stated that the}} evidence they presented proved that Einem's story was full of lies and inconsistencies, {{and that he did}} murder (with the help of others) Richard Kelvin. They also stated that his admission that he had picked up Kelvin showed that he was in contact with him on 5 June; that the fibres and hairs proved that Einem was with him at the time of just before and/or at the time of death; and that the drugs proved Einem was with Kelvin in between those times. The prosecution also answered the doubts raised by the defence about when on 10 July the body was dumped at the airstrip by suggesting that Einem could have dumped the body sometime very late on 10 July or in the early morning of 11 July before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the day.|$|E

As Father O'Donnell comes to collect Sean for the football practice, Mary hopes that the cycle of hate can be stopped with her son ("Finale").|$|R
500|$|The rock monster {{climax of}} the film was {{ultimately}} dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On {{the last day of}} location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that [...] "our guy in the silly rubber suit ultimately just looked like... well, a guy in a silly rubber suit." [...] With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely it was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the film.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} Renesmee's unique name, Meyer wrote that she [...] "couldn't call her Jennifer or Ashley. What do you name the most unique {{baby in the}} world? I looked {{through a lot of}} baby name websites. Eventually I {{realized}} that there was no human name that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> me, so I surrendered to necessity and made up my own." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Robert M. Utley, Robert Martin was {{a member}} of the Jesse Evans gang of outlaws in New Mexico during the mid- to late 1870s. Billy the Kid briefly joined this group before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> John Tunstall. Evans's gang, a loose-knit consortium of desperadoes known as [...] "The Boys", ended up fighting against the [...] "Regulators" [...] during the Lincoln County War. Because of the time frame, the location, and his friendship with Martin, Curly Bill Brocius may have been a member of the Evans gang, as well.|$|E
2500|$|Rivera earned {{straight}} A's {{in school}} until her sophomore year, when at 15 {{she became pregnant}} with the first of her five children, Janney [...] "Chiquis" [...] Marín-Rivera. She supported {{the two of them}} by selling CDs at flea markets, while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian. Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's what I had to do, but my counselors told me there was no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise." [...] She attended California State University, Long Beach, and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> her father's record label.|$|E
2500|$|A 17-year-old {{architecture}} student visiting Philadelphia in June 1873, Louis Sullivan, closely {{examined a}} house nearing completion at 510 South Broad Street, {{and decided that}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the firm that designed it. The next day he presented himself to Frank Furness, and {{was hired as a}} draftsman at US$10 a week. The Bloomfield H. Moore House was the most ambitious Furness & Hewitt domestic commission to date, and Furness's interiors – manufacture attributed to Pabst – were his most perverse. The egrets from the Roosevelt dining table reappeared, this time supporting the dining room mantel, but the house is best remembered for the nightmarish chimneypiece in its library. The tall and massive walnut chimneypiece featured compressed columns supporting oversized piers incised with stylized sunflowers, twin [...] "hounds of hell" [...] grotesques snarling from behind shields, a diapered and gold-leafed tympanum bisected by a center column, a crocketed pediment rising to a finial, and twin owls staring down from the roof. The Moore house was demolished in the 1950s, but much of the chimneypiece, stripped of its grotesques and thus about 3 feet (0.91 m) shorter, survives. Sullivan went on to lead the Chicago School of Architecture, and become the mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|E
