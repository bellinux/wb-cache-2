5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an <b>interglacial</b> <b>period.</b> Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon <b>interglacial</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene <b>interglacial</b> <b>period.</b> This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E
40|$|The spatio-temporal {{changes in}} trace gas {{emissions}} and burnt biomass by paleofires in Chinese Loess Plateau {{over the last}} two glacial cycles have been reconstructed using vegetation (C 3 /C 4) specific fire emission factors and black carbon records in three loess-paleosol sections. Results show that the average mass emission rate (AMER) of total trace gases (TTG) and burnt biomass by fires (BBF) in glacial periods are 1 ~ 2 times higher than in <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods,</b> and they display a clear southward decrease during both glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods.</b> This pattern reflects the combined control on paleofire emissions by climate-induced fire regimes and succession of vegetation types. The substantial increases in TTG-AMER and BBF during the late Holocene relative to the middle-to-early Holocene at Lingtai and Weinan support existing conclusion that increased anthropogenic fire activities have occurred in Middle and Southern Plateau during late Holocene. To assess the influence of paleofires on soil carbon stocks, the ratios of BBF to above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), estimated by magnetic susceptibility-based paleorainfall and paleotemperature reconstruction, were calculated. In the Northern Plateau, the BBF/ANPP ratios during glacial periods are nearly 90 %, about 2 ~ 3 times higher than during <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods,</b> suggesting paleofires may be the overwhelming force modulating the cycling of terrestrial organic carbon in the region. However, in Middle and Southern Plateau, the large decrease in BBF/ANPP ratios to around 20 % and 10 % respectively during glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods</b> suggests that paleofires have had a minor impact on carbon storage in these areas during both glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

It was originally described as a subspecies of the cape hare (Lepus capensis), but was later given a species status by Renate Angermann in 1983. In 1987, Maria Luisa Azzaroli-Puccetti also listed the Ethiopian highland hare as a separate species, although she suggested {{it to be a}} primitive form of the European hare (Lepus europaeus), and is closely related to it, due to the similarity of their skulls. She mentioned that after an <b>interglacial</b> <b>period,</b> the retraction of glaciers Might have isolated the populations of the European hare on the Ethiopian plateau, which evolved as a different subspecies. Thus, the scientific name she suggested was L. europaeus starcki.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} archaeological {{findings in}} Denmark {{date back to}} the Eem <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> from 130,000–110,000 BC. Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC. The Nordic Bronze Age (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by burial mounds, which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot.|$|E
25|$|Paleoclimatology is {{the study}} of prehistoric weather. The Eemian <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> spanned 130,000–114,000 years ago.

40|$|We used a diagenetic {{model to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that manganese-rich layers in gas hydrate-bearing Arctic Ocean sediments are reliable time markers for <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods.</b> In the model, diagenesis is fuelled by two sources of reactive carbon: particulate organic carbon settling to the sediment surface, and methane diffusing up from deep gas hydrate deposits. The model includes oxidation of organic carbon and soluble reduced manganese by oxygen supplied continuously from an invariant bottom-water oxygen reservoir; reduction of particulate manganese by hydrogen sulfide generated through anaerobic methane oxidation; transport of dissolved oxygen and manganese by diffusion; and advective transport of particulate components by burial. [ [...] . ] Model runs reveal that, under idealized but realistic conditions for the Arctic Ocean, oxidation of upward-diffusing Mn(II) generates post-depositional manganese enrichments that cannot readily be distinguished from the manganese-rich sediment layers that accumulate during interglacials. This compromises the use of manganese-rich layers as proxies for <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods.</b> In contrast, manganese-rich layers may be used as first-order markers of <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods</b> in sediments where gas hydrates or other forms of reactive carbon are absent...|$|R
25|$|According to {{research}} published in Nature Geoscience, human {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide (CO2) will defer the next ice age. Researchers used data on Earth's orbit to find the historical warm <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> that looks most like the current one and from this have predicted that the next ice age would usually begin within 1,500 years.

25|$|During {{the last}} <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> {{and the most}} recent {{glaciation}} of the Pleistocene (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe was very different from the Balkans. The glaciations did not affect southeastern Europe {{to the extent that they}} did in the northern and central regions. The evidence of forest and steppe indicate the influence was not so drastic; some species of flora and fauna survived only in the Balkans. The Balkans today still abound in species endemic only to this part of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} climate processes {{since the middle}} to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as {{the rise and fall}} of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.|$|E

40|$|Samples {{from the}} upper portion of a cyclic pelagic {{carbonate}} sediment sequence in Deep-Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) hole 503 B (4. 0 °N, 95. 6 °W) are the first group to be analyzed for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic proxy-indicators of ice volume, deep ocean and surface water circulation, and atmospheric circulation in order to resolve the complex origin of the cyclicity. Temporal resolution is taken from the delta 18 O time scale, most other parameters are calculated {{in terms of their}} mass flux to the seafloor. CaCO 3 percent in the sediments fluctuates in the well-known Pacific pattern and is higher during glacial times. The fluxes of opal and organic carbon have patterns similar to each other and show a variability of a factor of 2. 5 to 4. The longer organic carbon record shows flux maxima during both glacial and interglacial times. The accumulation patterns of both opal and organic carbon suggest that the variability in surface water productivity and/or seafloor preservation of those materials is not simply correlated to glacial or <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods.</b> Eolian dust fluxes are greater during <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods</b> by factors of 2 to 5, indicating that eolian source regions in central and northern South America were more arid during <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods.</b> The record of eolian grain size provides a semiquantitative estimation of the intensity of the transporting winds. The eolian data suggest more intense atmospheric circulation during <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods,</b> opposite to the anticipated results.

25|$|There {{are known}} {{examples}} of the Earth's climate producing a large response to small forcings. The CO2 feedback effect {{is believed to be}} part of the transition between glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods,</b> with orbital forcing providing the initial trigger.|$|R
25|$|The {{earth has}} been in an <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> known as the Holocene for around 11,700 years, and an article in Nature in 2004 argues {{that it might be}} most {{analogous}} to a previous interglacial that lasted 28,000 years. Predicted changes in orbital forcing suggest that the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now, even in absence of human-made global warming (see Milankovitch cycles). Moreover, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases might outweigh orbital forcing for as long as intensive use of fossil fuels continues.|$|E
25|$|Like Earth, the {{obliquity}} of Mars undergoes periodic changes {{which can}} lead to long-lasting changes in climate. Once again, the effect is more pronounced on Mars because it lacks the stabilizing influence of a large moon. As a result, the obliquity can alter by as much as 45°. Jacques Laskar, of France's National Centre for Scientific Research, argues that the effects of these periodic climate changes {{can be seen in the}} layered nature of the ice cap at the Martian north pole. Current research suggests that Mars is in a warm <b>interglacial</b> <b>period</b> which has lasted more than 100,000 years.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} <b>interglacial</b> <b>period,</b> the Red Sea coast of Eritrea was {{occupied}} by early anatomically modern humans. It is believed that the area was on the route out of Africa that some scholars suggest was used by early humans to colonize {{the rest of the}} Old World. In 1999, the Eritrean Research Project Team composed of Eritrean, Canadian, American, Dutch and French scientists discovered a Paleolithic site with stone and obsidian tools dated to over 125,000 years old near the Bay of Zula south of Massawa, along the Red Sea littoral. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters.|$|E

30|$|Five {{magnetic}} parameters (NRM, SIRM, S− 300, HIRM, and k) {{that vary}} with depth are shown for {{comparison with the}} oxygen isotope variations of the ODP 677 site in Fig. 3. A close correlation of susceptibility with NRM, SIRM, S− 300, and HIRM shows that the five parameters have high values in the <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods</b> and low values in the glacial periods. SIRM and k are relatively sensitive to variations in ferromagnetic mineral concentrations. The S− 300 ratios are > 0.9 in the <b>interglacial</b> <b>periods,</b> which reflects the dominance of low-coercivity minerals, such as magnetite. The low S− 300 ratios (< 0.85) in the glacial periods are interpreted as the dominance of high-coercivity minerals, such as hematite. HIRM represents the amount of high coercivity minerals.|$|R
5|$|The Pleistocene colder (glacial) and warmer (<b>interglacial)</b> <b>periods</b> in Poland {{began with}} the South Poland {{glaciation}} (San River glaciation, until 450,000 BCE), followed by the Masovian interglacial (450,000-370,000 BCE), the Middle Poland glaciation (370,000-128,000 BCE), the Eemian interglacial (128,000-115,000 BCE), and the Vistula glaciation (115,000-10,000 BCE).|$|R
25|$|This ‘staircase’ of flat topped {{terraces}} {{was created}} {{as a result of}} successive periods of deposition and subsequent down cutting by the river, a product of the meltwater and glacially eroded material produced from ice sheets at the end of glacial periods through the Pleistocene epoch between 450,000 and 12,000 years BP. Contained within these terraces is evidence of the mega fauna that once lived along the river, the bones and teeth of animals such as the woolly mammoth, bison and wolves that existed during colder periods have all been identified.

25|$|Australia and New Guinea are the {{two major}} land masses which make up the Australian continent. During its history, {{there have been many}} land {{connections}} between New Guinea and Australia. The most recent of which severed 10,000 years ago during the transition from a glacial period to the current <b>interglacial</b> <b>period.</b> The result of this recent land connection on the Australian amphibian fauna has been the swapping of species, and even families. The origin of the frog species found on both land masses can be determined by their distributions. It is likely that White's Tree Frog (Litoria caerulea) migrated from Australia to New Guinea, as it is widespread in Australia and only inhabits small areas within New Guinea. Whereas the Giant Tree Frog (Litoria infrafrenata) is likely from New Guinea, as it is widespread in New Guinea, and only inhabits the Cape York Peninsula in Australia. The single Nyctimystes species in Australia is another example of genus swapping that occurred between New Guinea and Australia.|$|E
