5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland can be {{considered}} politically neutral as it is mentioned in the book several times {{that it is the}} last place for fugitives and that <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> there, the British are breaking the terms of its neutrality. Their economy seems to be Clanker-based.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
50|$|At the after-party, {{all four}} boys fulfill their pledges. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin {{afterwards}} {{on the grounds}} that they will drift apart when they go to college. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that <b>just</b> <b>by</b> them <b>being</b> together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up having sex. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did.|$|R

His mother gets a shock, and passes away instantly. Vikram is then tried in court, convicted, and sentenced to prison for several years. While he prison he acquires knowledge and skills to become a career criminal, as he now realizes that honesty does not pay, not realizing {{that this is going}} to pit him against his very own brother, Inspector Amar, who has also inherited Vikram's honesty and diligence.|$|R
25|$|Divination: The {{ability to}} obtain direct {{knowledge}} about an object, person, location or physical event through means {{other than the}} user's physical senses.

500|$|Both Resident Evil and {{the sequel}} appear on Roger Ebert's most hated films list, {{published}} in 2005. In his review, Ebert describes Resident Evil as a zombie movie {{set in the}} 21st century, where [...] "large metallic objects make crashing noises <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> looked at", and he criticizes the dialogue for being a series of commands and explanations with no [...] "small talk". The New York Times' Stephen Holden awarded Resident Evil 1.5 stars out of 5 saying that [...] "it has a frantic staccato that is more game-oriented than cinematic".|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We {{made our}} own scandal <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> ourselves. Maybe {{it was that}} he knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{appearing}} in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the [...] "extraordinary sweetness [...] his nature," [...] as he had played [...] "Machiavellian types so effectively" [...] in other films. Greg Wise was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie François, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, {{was one of the}} last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, [...] "Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity in all of us <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> there." [...] Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.|$|E

500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We {{do not want to see}} either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal. There {{is a lot of}} angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life. I still have the same emotions I had 20 years ago – I get frustrated or I get excited. I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when we changed the body with the actor." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yam took after a male {{performer}} to be [...] "no sissy", <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> in the audience, {{and became}} known as the female version of Kwai Ming Yeung, both AAA and vocal, before 1933, the year Ma Sze Tsang hired Tam Lan Hing to perform with him in Hong Kong.|$|R
50|$|During the Chalcolithic era and the Bronze Age, {{humans in}} the Mideast {{learned how to}} smelt, melt, cast, rivet, and (to a limited extent) forge copper and bronze. Bronze is an alloy of copper and {{approximately}} 10% to 20% Tin. Bronze is superior to <b>just</b> copper, <b>by</b> <b>being</b> harder, being more resistant to corrosion, and by having a lower melting point (thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast). Much of the copper used by the Mediterranean World came from the island of Cyprus. Most of the tin came from the Cornwall region of the island of Great Britain, transported by sea-borne Phoenician and Greek traders.|$|R
5000|$|While {{shooting}} for the Star Plus Valentine's Day special on 2015, media quizzed about {{his girlfriend and}} he surprised everyone <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> too honest and true about his relationship.

2500|$|Fishes {{can also}} learn from others the {{identity}} of predatory species. Fathead minnows, for example, can learn the smell of a predatory pike <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> simultaneously exposed to that smell {{and the sight of}} experienced minnows reacting with fear, and brook stickleback can learn the visual identity of a predator by watching the fright reaction of experienced fathead minnows. [...] Fish can also learn to recognize the odor of dangerous sites when they are simultaneously exposed to it and to other fish that suddenly show a fright reaction. [...] Hatchery-raised salmon can learn the smell of a predator by being simultaneously exposed to it and to the alarm substance released by injured salmon.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS television, social historian Eric Lott said, [...] "all the citizens' councils in the South called Elvis 'nigger music' and were terribly afraid that Elvis, white as he was, being ambiguously raced <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> working-class, was going to corrupt the youth of America." [...] Robert Kaiser says {{he was the first}} who gave the people [...] "a music that hit them where they lived, deep in their emotions, yes, even below their belts. Other singers had been doing this for generations, but they were black." [...] Therefore, his performance style was frequently criticized. Social guardians blasted anyone responsible for exposing impressionable teenagers to his [...] "gyrating figure and suggestive gestures." [...] The Louisville chief of police, for instance, called for a no-wiggle rule, so as to halt [...] "any lewd, lascivious contortions that would excite the crowd." [...] Even Priscilla Presley confirms that [...] "his performances were labeled obscene. My mother stated emphatically that he was 'a bad influence for teenage girls. He arouses things in them that shouldn't be aroused.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around all the time when I was first here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts." ...|$|E
30|$|Besides that, {{according}} to Chalmers and Fuller (1996), “metacognition” refers to {{two aspects of}} thinking: awareness about cognition and control of cognition. In this study, apparently students have awareness about cognition, but what they may lack is the control or regulation of cognition. In other words, <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> aware of the knowledge is insufficient, as students {{have to know how}} to put the knowledge into practice.|$|R

2500|$|Searle {{argues that}} his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no {{empirical}} basis. He writes that, {{in order to}} consider the [...] "system reply" [...] as remotely plausible, a person must be [...] "under the grip of an ideology". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any [...] "system" [...] can have consciousness, <b>just</b> <b>by</b> virtue of <b>being</b> a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.|$|R

Billy had beaten him, not with the weapons of learning, but <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> himself and by speaking out the truth that was in him. Best of all, he had not even known that he had beaten, and had taken the applause as good-natured banter.

60|$|Hardly was Jimmy Skunk beyond {{sight and}} hearing after having made his call than Redeye the Vireo, whose home is {{in a tree}} just {{at the foot of}} the hill where Prickly Porky lives, heard a very strange noise. He was very busy, was Redeye, telling all who would listen how happy he was and what a {{beautiful}} world this is. Redeye seems to think that this is his special mission in life, that he was put in the Green Forest for this one special purpose,--to sing all day long, even in the hottest weather when other birds forget to sing, his little song of gladness and happiness.

From the absorption of her attitude, the large, sidelong head, the motionless hands, it was clear that Mrs Monnerie found a good deal to interest her in the dark, attentive figure that stood before her. If Fanny had been Joan of Arc, she could not have had a more single-minded reception. Yet I was enjoying a duel: a duel not of wits, but of intuitions, between the sagacious, sardonic, watchful old lady, soaked in knowledge of humanity but, as far as I could discover, with extraordinarily small respect for it, and--Fanny. And {{it seemed to me that}} Fanny easily held her own; <b>just</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> herself, without revealing herself. Face, figure, voice; that was all. I could not take my eyes away.

True, Lady Underhill would probably have been rude to her in the opening stages of the interview, but she would not have been alarmed and suspicious; or, rather, the vague suspicion which she had been feeling would not have solidified, as it did now into definite certainty of the worst. All that Derek had effected by his careful diplomacy had been to convince his mother that he considered his bride-elect something to be broken gently to her.|$|R

Based on this overview, the argument pursued in the paper is that space does not become political <b>just</b> <b>by</b> virtue of <b>being</b> full of power or competing interests. It becomes political by becoming the place where a wrong can be addressed and equality can be demonstrated.
