40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of air-decked blasting technology has enabled the {{efficient use of}} explosion energy, which proves that the air-decked blasting technology can overcome many disadvantages caused by column charge effectively, getting ideal explosion effect. Based on the JHC model of concrete damage evolution, the dynamic stress characteristics and failure mechanism of blast-hole near-field about bottom-air-decked charge structure is studied by numerical simulation. Result shows that the failure mechanism of typical elements changes from compression-shear failure into shear-tensile failure gradually {{with the increase of}} their position, for the effecting factors of the freedom and the loading from the hole. Comparing the dynamic stress characteristics of different detonating manners, <b>indirect</b> <b>initiation</b> can improve the static function intensity and delay the time of detonation gas. It is easier to destroy the bottom rock of hole...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the JHC {{model of}} {{concrete}} damage evolution, the dynamic stress characteristics and failure mechanism of blast-hole near-field about different air-decked charge structures are studied by numerical simulation. Result {{shows that the}} failure mechanism of typical elements changes from compression-shear failure into shear-tensile failure gradually {{with the increase of}} their position in <b>indirect</b> <b>initiation</b> of both top-air-decked and bottom-air-decked charges, because of the affecting factors of the freedom and the loading from the hole. If middle-air-decked charges detonate from the top and bottom at the same time, loading and unloading waves in blasting hole are more influential to the damage of bottom elements than the surface freedom, because detonation waves of both top and bottom meet at the middle hole, so it is conducive to the media failure at the bottom hole, the elements of freedom surface have the same failure properties to top-air-decked charge...|$|E
40|$|Objective Discussing the {{potential}} deterioration {{of a child}} who has a life-limiting condition has recognised benefits for future care, but can be challenging in a clinical context where uncertain illness trajectories are common. Existing research is restricted to indirect forms of evidence such as self-report data from clinicians and families. This study directly explores how discussions about deterioration are managed within actual paediatric palliative care consultations. Methods Nine consultations were video recorded in an Australian paediatric palliative care service. Each consultation involved the same paediatric palliative care specialist. Conversation analysis was used to identify and explore recurrent ways in which discussions about deterioration came to be realised. Findings The study identified two communicative practices used by a paediatric palliative care specialist that afforded opportunities to discuss deterioration: 1) soliciting the family’s agenda for the consultation; 2) initiating and maintaining topics where discussing deterioration is a relevant possibility. Across these different practices, a common feature was <b>indirect</b> <b>initiation</b> of discussions about deterioration. This approach made such discussions possible, but without mandating or even suggesting that such discussion must occur. Conclusions These communicative practices balance the benefit of discussing deterioration against a recognised importance of allowing discussions to be directed by a child’s family. This was achieved by creating opportunities for discussing deterioration, without making such discussions necessary...|$|E
2500|$|Rand's {{defense of}} {{individual}} liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy. Since {{reason is the}} means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person's most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values. The use or threat of force neutralizes the practical effect of an individual's reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, [...] "man's mind will not function {{at the point of}} a gun." [...] Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail. Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries. Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral, as are <b>indirect</b> <b>initiations</b> of force through threats, fraud, or breach of contract. The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate.|$|R
40|$|A “purely gasdynamic ” <b>indirect</b> {{detonation}} <b>initiation</b> {{process is}} presented {{that can be}} independent of diffusion, viscosity and turbulence, and does not require direct initiation. In this process, energy is deposited into a finite volume of fluid in {{an amount of time}} that is similar to the acoustic timescale of the fluid volume. Highly resolved two-dimensional simulations show that the artificial diffusion implicit in the numerical method is demon-strated to accelerate detonation formation. It is shown that given sufficient resolution, the detonation formation time becomes dependent only on large-scale gasdynamics and is independent of the small scale structures. I...|$|R

40|$|Voltage gated sodium {{channels}} (NaChs) {{are essential}} for action potential initiation and propagation. As seen with genetic mutations, modifications altering the kinetic properties of NaChs have serious repercussions within neuronal network communication and underlie multiple disease states. This work evolved from the identification of a non-genetic NaCh modification within a neurodegenerative disorder: the finding that NaChs are proteolyzed following in vitro diffuse axonal injury, a model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a broad spectrum inhibition of proteolysis leads to {{a significant reduction in}} Ca 2 + deregulation after injury. Ca 2 + deregulation is a prominent effect of TBI, therefore, if NaCh proteolysis contributes to this pathology, inhibition of proteolysis or inhibition of the downstream effects of proteolysis becomes a viable therapeutic option in treating patients with TBI, eliminating the need to directly inhibit NaChs that are essential to physiological neuronal transmission. ^ Therefore, to identify potential therapeutic candidates, we investigated the conditions leading to proteolysis of NaChs, the protease mediating proteolysis, and the functional significance of NaCh proteolysis. We found that proteolysis occurs within in vitro and in vivo models of TBI, requires elevated intracellular [Ca 2 +], and is mediated by the Ca 2 + dependent protease calpain. NMDA receptors and NaChs, both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>initiation</b> points for Ca 2 + entry following a mechanical insult, are the major driving force for calpain activation and targeting of NaChs. Proteolyzed NaChs remain at the membrane surface prior to neuronal death and are located along, but not restricted to, unmyelinated axonal tracts. Six hours following a stretch injury, at the time of robust NaCh proteolysis, somatic neuronal responses to the NaCh agonist, veratridine, are altered. Inhibition of calpain activation and NaCh proteolysis, through overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin, fails to prevent the injury response to veratridine. This suggests that axonal, rather than somatic, proteolyzed sodium channels are the underlying contributors to the pathological changes seen after diffuse axonal injury and that therapies should be designed to specifically target this population of NaChs. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{technology}} within {{combustion engines}} {{have the possibility}} of handling the more stringent legislative demands on combustion engines. However the required solutions are getting more expensive and technically challenging. One possible way towards a more simple exhaust aftertreatment system {{is the use of}} the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine cycle. The main advantage of the HCCI engine is its low output of NOx exhaust emissions. Because of its <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>initiation</b> the main disadvantage is that it requires closed loop control of its combustion process. Two methods for engine timing control were used, dual fuels or variable valve actuation(VVA). With dual fuels the timing change was achieved by changing the autoignition properties of the homogeneous charge and with VVA, timing control was achieved by changing the effective compression ratio. This thesis focuses on the control of the HCCI engine. For the purpose of studying control of the HCCI engine, special engine control software was developed. This software aimed towards engine cycle-to-cycle control and actuation. Another aid in the development was the use of Matlab/Simulink for the design of powerful control algorithms. Successful system identification control design has been shown. Different control strategies were tested, amongst the most successful was the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC), which is a control strategy that can take care of the nonlinear behavior of the dynamic engine system and its actuators. It was concluded that low order models were sufficient for capturing the important HCCI engine dynamics. The use of ion current for detection and control of the HCCI combustion was also shown. A method for obtaining combustion timing from the ion current was defined and investigated. Closed-loop control using ion currents on an HCCI engine was demonstrated...|$|R
