I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

25|$|Agnes’s {{relationship}} with her daughter, Julia, does not fare much better. Julia also embarrasses her mother. When Julia becomes hysterical, Tobias asks Agnes to go talk to their daughter.

This same self-absorption is apparent in all of Agnes’s relationships. She easily becomes lost in self-pity {{and at the same}} time believes herself to be above <b>everyone</b> <b>around</b> her. If she is the fulcrum of the balance in the family, Albee portrays her as a very unstable one. Albee has admitted that the character of Agnes is based on his real-life adopted mother.|$|E
