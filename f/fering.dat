50|$|<b>Fering</b> is the dialect of North Frisian spoken on {{the island}} of Föhr in the German region of North Frisia. <b>Fering</b> refers to the <b>Fering</b> Frisian name of Föhr, Feer. Together with the Öömrang, Söl'ring, and Heligolandic dialects, it forms part of the insular group of North Frisian dialects and it is very similar to Öömrang.|$|E

40|$|Root iron {{mobilization}} {{genes are}} induced by iron deficiency downstream {{of an unknown}} signaling mechanism. The <b>FER</b> gene, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix domain protein and putative transcription factor, is required for induction of iron mobilization genes in roots of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). To study upstream regulatory events of <b>FER</b> action, we examined the control of <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein expression in response to iron nutritional status. We analyzed expression of the <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein in wild-type plants, in mutant plants with defects in iron uptake regulation, and in 35 S transgenic plants that overexpressed the <b>FER</b> gene. An affinity-purified antiserum directed against <b>FER</b> epitopes was produced that recognized <b>FER</b> protein in plant protein extracts. We found that the <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein were consistently down-regulated in roots after generous (100 μm, physiologically optimal) iron supply compared to low (0. 1 μm) and sufficient (10 μm) iron supply. <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein expression were also occasionally down-regulated at sufficient compared to low iron supply. Analysis of <b>FER</b> protein expression in <b>FER</b> overexpression plants, as well as cellular protein localization studies, indicated that <b>FER</b> was down-regulated by high iron at the posttranscriptional level. The <b>FER</b> protein was targeted to plant nuclei and showed transcriptional activation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). <b>FER</b> protein regulation in the iron accumulation mutant chloronerva indicated that <b>FER</b> protein expression was not directly controlled by signals derived from iron transport. We conclude that <b>FER</b> is able to affect transcription in the nucleus and its action is controlled by iron supply at multiple regulatory levels...|$|R

50|$|A {{major part}} of the {{population}} in the west of the island speaks, besides German, a local idiom of the North Frisian language known as <b>Fering</b> or Föhring. <b>Fering</b> is again divided into the two dialects of Westerland Föhr and Osterland Föhr, being the western and eastern halves of the island respectively. In Osterland Low German is more popular than <b>Fering</b> and especially in Wyk the traditional language is Standard German.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} <b>Fering</b> authors. One {{of the first}} {{publicly}} noticed writers was Arfst Jens Arfsten (1812-1899) who began writing anecdotes in <b>Fering</b> around 1855. Others include Stine Andresen (1849-1927) who was a poet and writer from Wyk whose literature often refers to her native island. She published her poetry in German but also in <b>Fering.</b> In 1991, Ellin Nickelsen's novelette Jonk Bradlep (Dark Wedding) was published. With it, she won the first ever held North Frisian literature competition.|$|E
50|$|Around 3,000 of Föhr's 8,700 {{people speak}} <b>Fering</b> (1,500 {{of them being}} native speakers), constituting {{a third of all}} North Frisian speakers. An unknown number of emigrants in the United States of America, mainly in New York and Northern California, speak <b>Fering</b> as well. <b>Fering</b> differs from other North Frisian dialects in that it is also used {{publicly}} on Föhr, not only at home. The municipalities of Oldsum and Süderende (Fering: Olersem, Söleraanj) {{in the western part of}} Föhr are strongholds of the dialect.|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} strainMagnetospirillum gryphiswaldenseMSR- 1 {{does not}} produce siderophores, but it absorbs {{a large amount of}} ferric iron and synthesizes magnetosomes. We demonstrated previously the presence of six types of ferric reductase isozymes (termed <b>FeR</b> 1 through <b>FeR</b> 6) inMSR- 1. Of these isozymes, <b>FeR</b> 5 was the most abundant and <b>FeR</b> 6 showed the highest ferric re-ductase activity. In the present study, we cloned the <b>fer</b> 5 and <b>fer</b> 6 genes fromMSR- 1 and expressed them separately in Escherichia coli. <b>FeR</b> 5 and <b>FeR</b> 6 were shown to be bifunctional enzymes through analysis of amino acid sequence homologies, structural pre-dictions (using data fromGenBank), and detection of enzyme activities. <b>FeR</b> 5 is a thioredoxin reductase and <b>FeR</b> 6 is a flavin re-ductase, in addition to being ferric reductases. To elucidate the functions of the enzymes, we constructed two single-gene-dele-tion mutant strains (<b>fer</b> 5 andfer 6 mutants) and a double-gene-deletion mutant strain (<b>fer</b> 5 <b>fer</b> 6 [fer 56] mutant) along with its complemented strains (C 5 and C 6). An evaluation of phenotypic and physiological properties did not reveal significant differences between the wild-type and single-gene-deletion strains, whereas the double-gene-deletion strain showed reduced iron absorption and nomagnetosome synthesis. Complementation of the double-gene-deletion strain using either <b>fer</b> 5 or <b>fer</b> 6 resulted in the partial recovery of magnetosome synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of <b>fer</b> 5 and <b>fer</b> 6 transcriptional levels in the wild-type and complemented strains demonstrated consistent transcription of the two genes and confirmed that <b>FeR</b> 5 and <b>FeR</b> 6 are bifunctional enzymes that play complementary roles during the process of magnetosome synthesis in MSR- 1. Iron, the fourth most abundant element on earth, is essential formany physiological reactions, including protein synthesis in al...|$|R

50|$|During the whaling campaigns {{from the}} 17th {{to the early}} 19th centuries, many {{seafarers}} from Föhr changed their <b>Fering</b> birth names to Dutch names because they were regarded being more practical for their work abroad and more fashionable at home.

5000|$|Prise de <b>fer</b> is a {{movement}} used in fencing in which a fencer takes the opponent's blade into a line and holds it there in preparation to attack. Translated from French, the phrase prise de <b>fer</b> means [...] "taking-the-blade" [...] or [...] "taking-the-steel". Alternate spellings include the plural Prises de <b>Fer</b> or [...] "Les Prises de Fer", and (incorrectly) Praise de <b>Fer.</b> There are four prise de <b>fer</b> actions: opposition, croisè, bind, and envelopment. However, each fencing master and fencing doctrine has a separate view of prise de <b>fer.</b> William Gaugler lists all four actions under Prise de <b>Fer</b> in his dictionary of fencing terminology, while Roger Crosnier in his book Fencing with the Foil only mentions the croisé, the bind, and the envelopment as prise de <b>fer</b> actions. Any prise de <b>fer</b> action requires that the blades be engaged, and it works best against an opponent who uses and maintains a straight arm. Additionally, a successful action demands surprise, precise timing, and control.|$|R

The intracellular {{domain of}} PECAM- 1 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon homophilic engagement. However, it remains unclear which tyrosine kinase phosphorylates PECAM- 1. We sought to isolate tyrosine kinases responsible for PECAM- 1 phosphorylation and identified <b>Fer</b> as a candidate, based on expression cloning. <b>Fer</b> kinase specifically phosphorylated PECAM- 1 at the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Notably, <b>Fer</b> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP- 2, which is known to bind to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of PECAM- 1, and <b>Fer</b> also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab 1 (Grb 2 -associated binder- 1).
