500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E

[...] Complex noted that [...] "where the TMNT had April O'Neil to flirt with, the most bodacious chick in the Battletoads universe is ironically the final boss who wants them all dead." [...] According to Charmaine Williams of WhatCulture, actually [...] "the only thing [...] had going for it was the sexy Dark Queen. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think your show wont live to see a full season, might has well have a character with big boobs that lives in a penis shaped castle." [...] Rare Gamer included the Dark Queen in their lists of [...] "Top 5 Classic Rare Villains Who Just Didn't Know When To Quit" [...] and [...] "Top 5 Rare Femme Fatales (That Would Have Us Switching Sides)".

2500|$|He restated {{these goals}} to Wired {{magazine}} in 2010: [...] "The thing I {{really care about}} is the mission, making the world open." [...] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook. On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising {{as a result of}} its phenomenal growth, he explained: <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we could... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.|$|R
