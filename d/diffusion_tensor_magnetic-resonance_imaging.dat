However, relatively little {{work has been done}} on producing statistics of <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensors.</b> A main difficulty is that the space of <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensors,</b> i. e., the space of symmetric, positivedefinite matrices, does not form a vector space.

We then develop methods for producing statistics, namely averages and modes of variation, in this space. In our previous work we introduced principal geodesic analysis, a generalization of principal component analysis, to compute the modes of variation of data in Lie groups. In this work we expand the method of principal geodesic analysis to symmetric spaces and apply it to the computation of the variability of <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensor</b> data.

40|$|In this article, {{we discuss}} the {{theoretical}} background for diffusion weighted imaging and <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensor</b> imaging. Molecular <b>diffusion</b> is a random process involving thermal Brownian motion. In biological tissues, the underlying microstructures restrict the diffusion of water molecules, making diffusion directionally dependent. Water diffusion in tissue is mathematically characterized by the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensor,</b> the elements of which contain information about the magnitude and direction of diffusion and {{is a function of}} the coordinate system. Thus, it is possible to generate contrast in tissue based primarily on diffusion effects. Expressing diffusion in terms of the measured diffusion coefficient (eigenvalue) in any one direction can lead to errors. Nowhere is this more evident than in white matter, due to the preferential orientation of myelin fibers. The directional dependency is removed by diagonalization of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tensor,</b> which then yields a set of three eigenvalues and eigenvectors, representing the magnitude and direction of the three orthogonal axes of the diffusion ellipsoid, respectively. For example, the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector along the long axis of the fiber corresponds qualitatively to diffusion with least restriction.
