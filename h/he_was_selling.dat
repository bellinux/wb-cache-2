5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E
5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} years, several {{women and children}} who had hired Romasanta as a guide disappeared. The disappearances were not immediately noticed as Romasanta delivered letters to their families advising that they had arrived at their destinations and were settling in. However, suspicion was aroused when it was noticed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> their clothing locally and rumours spread that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> soap made from human fat. In 1852, a complaint was finally lodged in the city of Escalona alleging that Romasanta deceived women and children into travelling with him, that he then killed them and that he removed their fat which he then sold. He was arrested in September 1852, in Nombela, in the province of Toledo, and brought to trial in Allariz, in the province of Ourense. In his defence, Romasanta claimed that he was afflicted with Lycanthropy.|$|E
25|$|Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald) — The {{landlord}} of the Nag's Head, {{although not}} from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service. Good natured and somewhat gullible, he was often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any goods <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling.</b> When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, a storyline involving Mike's imprisonment for attempting to embezzle the brewery was written, and cafe owner Sid took over as interim pub landlord.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Reiser's arrest, the {{employees}} of Namesys stated they would continue to work, that the arrest had no immediate effect on {{the rate of the}} software's development, and if the case expanded over a longer time, they would seek solutions to ensure the long-term future of the company. On December 21, 2006, Reiser announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> the company to raise money for his increasing legal fees. According to an interview with Namesys employee Edward Shishkin, as of January 2008, the commercial activity of the company ceased but it had not been sold.|$|E
25|$|It is {{essential}} {{that there is some}} connection between a misrepresentation and a claimant's entry into the contract. For instance in Attwood v Small Mr Small made false claims about the capabilities of mines and steelworks, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> to Mr Attwood. Mr Attwood said he would verify the claims before he bought. He employed agents to check. The agents said the claims were true. It turned out they were not. But the House of Lords held that Mr Attwood could not escape the contract, since he did not rely on Mr Small. He relied on his agents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington. The media in England and Australia hotly debated {{the consequences of a}} move that would end Bradman's Test career. Bradman was advised by the Board of Control that if he played cricket in England in 1932, it would be another breach of his 1930 tour contract and therefore he would not be considered for Test selection if he went ahead with the deal. Public opinion divided: Australian cricket could not afford to lose him and some thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> his birthright, but {{at the height of the}} Depression, working-class people empathised with Bradman. The opportunity to earn over £1000 per annum was very tempting to a young man without a profession.|$|E

25|$|These {{networks}} {{took hold}} and strengthened thru the nineties setting up relationships with institutions and society sectors {{that were not}} associated as a university. After leaving the deanship, the University Council nominated Soto to the Constitutionality Court, although there were persistent rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> diplomas and certificates. However, his application was accepted because his involvement in these felonies could not be proved because no credible evidence was presented. Two of his performances in the Constitutionality Court showed possible political compromise: first, he voted to validate an illegal adoption network and, then he {{voted in favor of}} the registration as a presidential candidate of general Efrain Rios Montt, despite the prohibition of the 1985 Constitution, which does not allowed as a candidate anybody that had been part of a coup d'état. In those years, adoption networks operating in Guatemala could collect up to US$60,000 per child and went from delivering 1200 children in 1997 to more than four thousand in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>selling</b> to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a good case exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E

500|$|Once Arnold {{established}} himself at West Point, he began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength. Needed repairs were never ordered {{on the chain}} across the Hudson.

[...] Herriman's widespread influence on American , particularly his shape-shifting, psychedelic backgrounds, lack of respect for convention and his irreverence, is evident in the work of Robert Crumb, Denis Kitchen, and Bobby London.
