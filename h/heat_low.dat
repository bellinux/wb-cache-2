The Fennec project is designed to address this knowledge deficit. It is the first major climate program in the central Sahara. The ideas for Fennec, which is a British, French and German initiative, grew out of the African Multidisciplinary Monsoon Analysis (AMMA). Fennec is the project name - it is not an acronym.|$|E

50|$|A low {{pressure}} area persisted over the northern Bay of Bengal on July 22, eventually organizing into a depression on July 25 about 160 km (100 mi) south of Kolkata. Moving northwestward, the system quickly intensified into a deep depression, with peak winds estimated at 55 km/h (35 mph). Late on July 25, the system made landfall north of Balasore in Odisha state. It progressed inland across India, weakening to depression status but remaining a distinct system. On July 28, the depression degenerated into a remnant low over Rajasthan in northwestern India, later merging with a <b>heat</b> <b>low.</b> Rainfall associated with the system mostly occurred in the southwestern periphery, with a peak of 250 mm at Kendrapara; there was little damage.

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposed}} mechanisms {{for the development of}} gulf surges including gravity currents, ageostrophic flows, Kelvin waves, or Rossby waves. However, {{due to a lack of}} observations in the area, the exact cause is uncertain. The best data currently available that indicates moisture arriving from the gulf is from the NEXRAD radar in Yuma, Arizona. This instrument has the capability to measure wind speed and direction at several altitudes in the atmosphere in what is known as a vertical wind profile. The first indication of a gulf surge is a change in the surface wind direction at Yuma, Arizona, with the winds switching from westerly to south-easterly. This flow tends to get wider and deeper as the surge progresses. During the monsoon, there is a pressure difference between the <b>heat</b> <b>low</b> that is present over the Southwestern United States and the relative high pressure over the northern portion of the gulf. Winds will blow from the south due to the pressure gradient force. Typically, during a traditional surge, a large mesoscale convective system is located off the southern tip of the Baja peninsula. Flow around such a low pressure system is cyclonic, which corresponds to counter-clockwise. Some of this circulation will make its way into the gulf and get funneled northward towards the southwestern United States like a waveguide. As this moist air travels northward, it encounters the already present southerly winds and gets pushed into southern Arizona. The high pressure area over the northern gulf tends to push the moisture surge to the east towards the Tucson area.|$|E
50|$|Summer {{begins in}} early April and {{continues}} {{till the end}} of June, with the heat peaking in May. It is characterized by extreme <b>heat,</b> <b>low</b> humidity, very hot winds and thunderstorms. Delhi's proximity to the Thar Desert results in hot, dry continental winds, called loo, at times blowing all across from the West Asian mainland, making the days feel hotter. These winds, blowing over from vast land stretches, are very hot and dry. Since the Western Disturbance depression moves eastward (and is the reason for cyclonic occurrences in Eastern Coastal areas) by this time of the year, there is no moisture-laden wind to increase humidity. The air therefore remains dry or very dry during day. For most of its summer season, Delhi has a semi-arid climate. Coming from Spring, the city witnesses a spurt in day temperature around early April, whereas nights still remain pleasant. By the mid of April , maximum temperatures exceed 40 °C while the ambience remains very dry. Night temperatures cross the 20 °C mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 46 °C or higher. This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms. Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer, and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation. These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.A visual characteristic of summer in Delhi is the summer bloom, particularly the blooming Bougainvillea, Amaltas, Gulmohar, Shireesh and Jacaranda trees, which look spectacular when fully flowering during peak summer in May.|$|E
