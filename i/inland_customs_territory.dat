50|$|A <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> {{usually has}} {{inspection}} stations at its borders, {{but this is}} not always the case. For example, there are no border checks between the EU <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> and the Switzerland—Liechtenstein <b>customs</b> <b>territory,</b> since both are part of the Schengen Area. There can also be border checks between two parts of the same <b>customs</b> <b>territory.</b> For example, there are border checks between the Schengen Area portions of the EU <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> and those portions in the Common Travel Area formed by the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies, and Ireland. Another example is the border checks between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which are in a customs union. The European Union example is particularly complicated, since it also has different boundaries for EU VAT area, the EU excise duty area, the area where EU law applies, and the area considered by the EU statistics agency.|$|R
