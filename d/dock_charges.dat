500|$|Barry {{had a good}} {{reputation}} for the quick turn-around of ships, attributed to the [...] "lavish provision of approach lines and storage sidings", and the skill of the shunters (who ensured that every yard of storage capacity of the ships was utilised), the tippers (who tipped the coal onto the ships), and the trimmers (who shovelled the coal sideways until the coal was evenly distributed in the hold). [...] The tippers usually worked in gangs of four, and the <b>dock</b> <b>charges</b> and the wages of the tippers and the trimmers were based on tonnage. The wages of the shunters and the tippers were paid by the Railway Company, and the wages of the trimmers were paid by the colliery companies.|$|E
50|$|The HB&WRJR&DCo. began {{business}} with {{large amounts of}} debt, and {{within a year of}} its opening a price war had begun between the Hull Dock Company and the Hull and Barnsley on <b>dock</b> <b>charges,</b> and between the Hull and Barnsley and the NER on transit charges. Neither of the two Hull-based companies could expect to win against the much larger North Eastern Railway. By 1887 the HB&WRJR&DCo. was seeking a way out of debt and approached the Midland Railway for a possible merger. Reasonable terms were made, but the proposal was rejected by the shareholders of the Hull company. An amalgamation by the NER itself was then proposed, which would have included the NER paying off the HB&WRJR&DCo.'s debts; this scheme too was rejected.|$|E

25|$|The {{procurement}} committee {{met with the}} Navy for preliminary arrangements for the transfer of Piranha, however the Navy would not hold the submarine unless the committee made a formal application for her with possession being immediate once the donation contract was approved. Since the Arkansas River Navigable Waterway system would not be open {{for at least a}} year, interim <b>docking</b> <b>charges</b> would be incurred.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} <b>docking</b> <b>charger</b> station for mobile robots. One crucial task in swarm robots scenario {{is to find}} low battery robots and recover them. Overcoming this problem requires a versatile mobile charging station that is able to actively locate and charge inactive mobile robots unlike the conventional stationary docking stations. The mobile charger robot should perform independent tasks other than the swarm robots global task. It uses similar communication method with other swarm robots, however new preprogrammed instructions are required to facilitate battery charging task for swarm robots...|$|R

50|$|Dependence {{on foreign}} shippers, who were {{carrying}} over 80% of cargo by 1992, made the country vulnerable. When the NMA attempted {{to impose a}} <b>dock</b> <b>charge</b> of $0.25 per metric tonne of crude oil loaded in Nigerian ports and oil terminals, the shipping companies threatened to go elsewhere, saying the charge would make Nigerian oil uncompetitive. The NMA {{had no choice but}} to suspend the fee.The NMA charges on shipping lines that called into Nigerian ports were increased in 2003, with a surcharge being added to taxes on all Nigerian freights. In December 2004, based on recommendations from the World Bank, the government announced that all NMA charges would be scrapped as of January 2005. There were delays in implementing the change.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diesel-electric}} {{configuration of}} the Alicia allows the submarine {{to be placed on}} station at the dive site relatively rapidly, without the need for a large towing vessel and without eating into battery reserves. In addition it is possible to charge the air banks (used to [...] "blow" [...] the main ballast tanks) when under way on the surface, saving on maintenance time at the <b>dock.</b> <b>Charging</b> the main battery using the diesel engine to drive the main motor as a generator is also possible. The next generation will use the same rare-earth motor technology as S201. The motor will take the full power from the diesel generator set and like S201, drives the prop without the need for a reduction gear.|$|R

60|$|Should I {{take the}} {{westerly}} road which ran over a great plain? No, for then {{we might be}} seen for miles and cut off. Moreover, even if we escaped the natives, was it desirable we should plunge into civilization just now and tell all our story, as in that case we must do. Rodd's death was quite justified, but it had happened on Transvaal territory and would require a deal of explanation. Fortunately there was no witness of it, except ourselves. Yes, there was though--the driver Footsack, if he had got away, which, being mounted, would seem probable, a man who, for my part, I would not trust for a moment. It would be an ugly thing to see Anscombe in the <b>dock</b> <b>charged</b> with murder and possibly myself, with Footsack giving evidence against us before a Boer jury who might be hard on Englishmen.

5000|$|Other {{options for}} level 2 {{charging}} of the Leaf include the Blink <b>charging</b> <b>dock</b> from ECOtality (also {{available through the}} EV Project), the Schneider Electric Square-D, and the Evr-Green unit from Leviton. [...] A complete list of charging stations is available at Plug In America. [...] It is also possible to have the level 1 <b>charging</b> <b>dock</b> which comes with the Leaf modified to support both 120 V and 240 V charging, the latter at either 12 amps (...) or 16 amps (...) [...] [...] The 16 amp modification provides the maximum current draw the Leaf can use, and thus charges {{at the same rate}} as the AeroVironment <b>charging</b> <b>dock.</b> Various adapters allow using the modified unit with a wide range of 240 V sockets. The modified unit provides the cheapest charging solution for those with a 240 volt socket available and is portable for use at other locations. Possible disadvantages include the lack of UL certification and the potential for theft since the unit is not hardwired. The modification of the 120V charger could also void various warranties associated with the charging cable, EV system, and battery.|$|R
