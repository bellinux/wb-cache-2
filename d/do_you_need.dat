In 1971, Minh claimed that Thiệu was {{responsible}} for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. Đôn was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone [...] "Why are you so slow in doing it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> more troops? If you do, ask Đính to send more troops– and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general."

500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to {{give the appearance of}} reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations. The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to keep our stock price up?" [...] and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common shares outstanding). Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised. Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors’ beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.|$|E

After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." [...] Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking [...] "What else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing."

2500|$|On January 6, 1903, the university's only {{building}} {{burned down}} and destroyed many {{records of the}} early university.
