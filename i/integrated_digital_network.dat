The results obtained bring out its poor reliability thus pointing to the convenience of proposing other systems. Therefore, as a solution, a new mutual synchronization system is suggested whose greater reliability is the consequence of better use of the information available in each control center...|$|E

The suggested changeover to the ISDN network (<b>Integrated</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Network)</b> with a transmission rate of 64 kbit/s will get rid of slow page turning and be of great help to business communications.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the policies of}} the EC aiming towards a coordinated introduction of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) in all member countries by 1993. ISDN originally {{was supposed to be a}} new telecommunications network that eventually would replace the old telephone network. ISDN is " [...] . a network, in general evolving from a telephone IDN (<b>Integrated</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Network),</b> that provides end-to-end digital connectivity to support a wide range of services, including voice and non-voice services, to which users have access by a limited set of standard multipurpose user-network interfaces" (CCITT). In this paper I will argue that the ISDN activities of the EC are somewhat trapped between the attempt to liberalize the so far closed and fragmented European telecommunications markets on the one hand and the aim to build up a strong independent European telecommunications industry and a European wide telecommunications network on the other hand. ISDN therefore cannot fulfil the expectations of the Commission...|$|E

40|$|The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{represents}} the current position {{in about a}} hundred years of evolutionary growth of the worldwide telecommunications infrastructure. This evolution {{is by no means}} complete and the next few years will see the emergence of a "Broad-band" ISDN as the next stage of evolutionary development. It is important to appreciate the evolutionary nature of the telecommunications infrastructure if one is to properly understand much of the thinking that lies behind the current ISDN proposals. This book therefore begins with a number of chapters devoted to a study of the various developments which have eventually led to the concept of an <b>integrated</b> <b>digital</b> <b>network.</b> These include the development of digital transmission of speech using PCM and the development of digital switching techniques based on stored program control. The book then turns to a consideration of those features of the existing telecommunications network which need to be modified in order to make ISDN a realizable practicality. Of particular importance is the digitization of transmission over the links between the user and the local exchange. Next we look at the current practice and proposals for ISDN based on the technology presently in use in the telephone network. Finally, we look at the proposals for a broadband ISDN likely to become widely available {{by the turn of the}} century...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Telecommunication {{has matured}} to a broadly applied tool in {{diagnostic}} pathology. Technology and Systems Contemporary {{with the development}} of fast electronic communication lines (<b>Integrated</b> <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> services (ISDN), broad band connections, and fibre optics, as well as the digital imaging technology (digital camera), telecommunication in tissue - based diagnosis (telepathology) has matured. Open access (internet) and server - based communication have induced the development of specific medical information platforms, such as iPATH, UICC-TPCC (telepathology consultation centre of the Union International against Cancer), or the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) teleconsultation system. They have been closed, and are subject to be replaced by specific open access forums (Medical Electronic Expert Communication System (MECES) with embedded virtual slide (VS) technology). MECES uses php language, data base driven mySqL architecture, X/L-AMPP infrastructure, and browser friendly W 3 C conform standards. Experiences The server - based medical communication systems (AFIP, iPATH, UICC-TPCC) have been reported to be a useful and easy to handle tool for expert consultation. Correct sampling and evaluation of transmitted still images by experts reported revealed no or only minor differences to the original images and good practice of the involved experts. β tests with the new generation medical expert consultation systems (MECES) revealed superior results in terms of performance, still image viewing, and system handling, especially as this is closely related to the use of so - called social forums (facebook, youtube, etc.). Benefits and Expectations In addition to the acknowledged advantages of the former established systems (assistance of pathologists working in developing countries, diagnosis confirmation, international information exchange, etc.), the new generation offers additional benefits such as acoustic information transfer, assistance in image screening, VS technology, and teaching in diagnostic sampling, judgement, and verification. </p...|$|E
