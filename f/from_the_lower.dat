5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the fossil record of insects is scant, including beetles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> Triassic. However, there are a few exceptions, such as in Eastern Europe. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, numerous beetle fossils were discovered, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea). However, species from the families Cupedidae and Schizophoroidae are not present at this site, whereas they dominate at other fossil sites <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> Triassic. Further records are known from Khey-Yaga, Russia, in the Korotaikha Basin.|$|E

5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe {{is worthy of}} consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it is derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered {{from the base of}} the underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E

5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> hoist {{to the upper}} fly.

5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E

Archaeological excavations have revealed remnants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> Paleolithic period. Artifacts have also been found at the Roman town of Colonia Civitas Pacensis in the Badajoz area, although a significant number of larger artifacts were found in Mérida.|$|E

5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> deck to the upper deck.|$|E

Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E
