40|$|In many cognitive, metacognitive, and perceptual tasks, {{measurement}} of performance or prediction accuracy {{may be influenced}} by response bias. Signal detection theory provides a means of assessing discrimination accuracy independent of such bias, but its application crucially depends on distributional assumptions. The Goodman–Kruskal <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient,</b> G, has been proposed as an alternative means of measuring accuracy that is free of distributional assumptions. This measure is widely used with tasks that assess metamemory or metacognition performance. The authors demonstrate that the empirically determined value of G systematically deviates from its actual value under realistic conditions. A distribution-specific variant of G, called G c, is introduced to show why this bias arises.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine metacognitive {{accuracy}} (i. e., the relationship between metacognitive judgment and memory performance), researchers often rely on by-participant analysis, where metacognitive accuracy (e. g., resolution, {{as measured by the}} <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient</b> or signal detection measures) is computed for each participant and the computed values are entered into group-level statistical tests such as the t-test. In the current work, we argue that the by-participant analysis, regardless of the accuracy measurements used, would produce a substantial inflation of Type- 1 error rates, when a random item effect is present. A mixed-effects model is proposed as a way to effectively address the issue, and our simulation studies examining Type- 1 error rates indeed showed superior performance of mixed-effects model analysis as compared to the conventional by-participant analysis. We also present real data applications to illustrate further strengths of mixed-effects model analysis. Our findings imply that caution is needed when using the by-participant analysis, and recommend the mixed-effects model analysis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relation}} of the consensuality of answers in syllogistic reasoning problems to metacognitive judgments and response times. In two experiments, participants (N= 126) solved syllogistic problems and made metacognitive judgments (judgment of confidence in the correctness of the answer and judgment of task difficulty), after or before solving each problem. Intraindividual correlation coefficients (Goodman-Kruskal <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient)</b> between reasoning accuracy and metacognitive judgments and between answer consensuality and metacognitive judgments were computed from the joint data of both experiments. Mean gamma coefficients were higher for consensuality than for reasoning accuracy both for judgments of confidence and judgments of task difficulty.

The results indicate that reasoners, instead of monitoring their actual performance, seem to rely on different type of cues while making metacognitive judgments in syllogistic reasoning.

Materials and methods: An in vitro study analyzing the contribution of the endosteal surface of cortical bone and cancellous bone to the trabecular pattern was conducted, using 60 specimens of desiccated human mandibles. The mode of execution involved IOPA radiographic evaluation of premolarmolar segments in the specimens before and after removal of cancellous bone. The radiographs were numbered for identification and subjected to evaluation by 5 dentomaxillofacial radiologists who were doubleblinded to ensure an unbiased interpretation.

The resultsobtained indicate that educational attainment may depend on geographical clustering,but that the geographical scale of analysis is highly influential on the findings.

On the other hand, rainfall {{is one of the}} most complicated effective hydrologic processes in runoff prediction. For a developing country such as Malaysia which is prone to flood disaster having such an expert model for runoff forecasting is a very vital matter. In this article, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is proposed to forecast the rainfall for Klang River in Malaysia on monthly basis. To be able to train and test the ANFIS and ANN models, the statistical data from 1997 to 2008, was obtained from Klang gates dam data. The optimum structure and optimum input pattern of model was determined through trial and error. Different combinations of rainfall were produced as inputs and five different criteria were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each network and its ability to make precise prediction. The performance of the ANFIS model is compared to artificial neural network (ANN) model. The five criteria are root mean square error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (2 R), and Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NE), <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient</b> (GC) Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). The result indicate that the ANFIS model showed higher rainfall forecasting accuracy and low error compared to the ANN model.

Various surgical and nonsurgical therapies for the treatment of this pathology have been proposed. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate, through a retrospective longitudinal study, the efficacy and efficiency of the conservative treatment with a new device, called RADICA, specifically designed and patented for chronic joint lock treatment. Methods: 141 patients were recruited according to specific criteria from those arrived at our observation unit in the decade 2001 - 2012. All patients were analyzed by measuring and comparing in the short and medium term specific clinical parameters according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD).

Explicit formulae with arbitrary d/s and Δ are obtained and discussed for the critical temperature, and the condensed fraction, {{as well as for}} the thermodynamic properties: equation of state from where we deduce a generalized Δ independent thermal de Broglie wavelength, internal energy, specific heats as well as their jumps at T_c, the <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient</b> C_P/C_V, entropy, Helmholtz free energy, entalpy and Gibbs free energy. When Δ > 0, a Bose-Einstein critical temperature T_c ≠ 0 exists for any d > 0 at which the internal energy shows a peak and the specific heat shows a jump. Both the critical temperature and the specific heat jump increase as functions of the gap but they decrease as functions of d/s. At sufficiently high temperatures Δ- independent classical results are recovered. However, for temperatures below the critical one the gap effects are predominant.

Baker [13] investigated the impact of observational errors on the dendrograms produced by the complete linkage and single linkage hierarchical grouping techniques. The goodness of fit of the dendrograms was measured by means of the Goodman-Kruskal <b>gamma</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The gamma coefficients indicated that the single linkage grouping technique was more sensitive to the type of data errors employed than the complete linkage technique. Hubert [14] compared two rank orderings of the object pairs. He tested hypothesis that the given set of proximity values have been assigned randomly by referring the Goodman-Kruskal rank correlation γ statistic to an approximate permutation distribution. Kuiper and Fisher [15] compared six hierarchical clustering procedures (single linkage, complete linkage, median, average linkage, centroid and Ward’s method) for multivariate normal data, assuming that the true number of clusters was known. The authors used the Rand index, which gives a proportion of correct groupings, to compare the clustering methods. In their study for clusters of equal sizes, Ward’s method and complete linkage method, with very unequal cluster sizes centroid and average linkage method found best, respectively. Blashfield [16] compared four types of hierarchical clustering methods (single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage and Ward’s method) for accuracy in recovery of original population clusters. He used Cohen’s statistic to measure the accuracy of the clustering methods. According to his results, Ward’s method performed significantly better than the other clustering procedures and average linkage gave relatively poor results. According to Milligan [17], complete linkage and Ward’s method reacted badly when outliers were introduced into the simulated data.|$|E
