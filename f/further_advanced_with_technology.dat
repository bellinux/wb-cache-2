40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly recognised that the IS-LM-AS model {{is no longer the}} best pedagogic tool for describing the way monetary policy works in most industrialised countries. Emerging in its place is the TaylorRomer (TR) model of macroeconomic stabilisation, in which the central bank adopts an interest rate rule. The TR model has the twin advantages of being more realistic and simpler than the traditional IS-LM-AS model. This article argues that the goals of realism and simplicity can be <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>with</b> some refinement of the TR model. Several minor modifications are advocated. An additional change is proposed to the diagram so as to reflect better the actual adjustment paths that are likely to be observed following demand and supply shocks.

40|$|Abstract. Based on 2. 0 L spark {{ignition}} direct-injection(SIDI) turbo charged gasoline engine with variable valve timing(VVT), the spark timing effects on combustion process, fuel consumption, knock limitation and emissions were studied with external exhaust gas recirculation(EGR) on different loads and speeds. For {{the purpose of}} easily comparing data results, the location of 50 % mass fraction burned(CA 50) was widely used in this paper. The study results show that CA 50 is changing linearly with spark timing. To reach the same combustion phase, spark timing need to be <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>with</b> external EGR. Combustion variability of IMEP(COV) increase sharply with retarding of CA 50 with external EGR. The external EGR can greatly improve knock limitation and knock intensity(KI). To reach the best fuel consumption, CA 50 need to be advanced to 6 ºCA to 8 ºCA for both with external EGR and without external EGR. NOx emissions increase <b>with</b> <b>advancing</b> of spark timing. HC show different trends when retarding spark timing with and without external EGR...|$|R
