5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{had been the}} original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties, but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity.</b> The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{qualitative}} {{assessment of}} the <b>early</b> <b>opportunities</b> for capturing carbon dioxide from advanced gasification plants, and of design guidelines for carbon capture ready gasification plants in China, is conducted to investigate current development in coal gasification. The assessment first illustrates the development {{of different types of}} gasification technology in China. Capturing carbon dioxide from high concentration stationary emission points could be seen as an <b>early</b> <b>opportunity</b> for carbon capture demonstration. The large scale CTL plants and chemical plants installed with advanced entrained flow gasifier should be considered as <b>early</b> <b>opportunity</b> for CCS in China. However, given that the total amount of emissions and the scale of emission sources are relatively small at those plants compared with conventional coal fired plant, the potential emission reduction is very limited...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCCS {{technology}} {{is particularly important}} to China due to its large and rapidly rising emissions and high dependence on fossil fuel. There is a huge basin scale theoretical CO 2 storage capacity in China; however the CCS deployments will consider firstly those matched source-sink pairs with <b>early</b> <b>opportunities</b> at present. This paper presents the key results of evaluation of <b>early</b> <b>opportunities</b> for the deployment of CCS technologies within China. The proximity analysis suggests that there also are many <b>early</b> <b>opportunities</b> for CCS deployment, such as the promising EOR/EGR opportunities from using high concentration CO 2 sources. The combined benefits of short distance between sources and sinks, the potential hydrocarbon revenues and low CO 2 capture cost make these pairs as promising near-term CCS candidates. These near-term CCS candidates can be deployed at very low cost or even with some revenue. In this paper, several sources-sink pairs in China are analyzed in details, such as, the pairs of high purity CO 2 emission sources and aquifer, co-storage of waste gas stream and depleted gas fields, IGCC and aquifer. These <b>early</b> <b>opportunities</b> will provide China the chance to develop and spread CCS technologies steadily from early stage to commercial stage...|$|R

5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity.</b> The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E

Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity,</b> particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League and ended up as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1938, the first 50 Hurricanes had reached squadrons and, at that time, it had been {{assessed}} {{that the rate of}} production was slightly greater than the RAF's capacity to introduce the new aircraft, which had already been accelerated. Accordingly, the British government gave Hawker the clearance to sell excess aircraft to nations that were likely to oppose German expansion. As a result, there were some modest export sales made to other countries; at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity,</b> a former RAF Hurricane I was dispatched to Yugoslavia for evaluation purposes. Shortly after this evaluation, an order for 24 Hurricane Mark Is for the Royal Yugoslav Air Force was received; this was followed by the purchase of a production licence for the Hurricane by Yugoslavia.

Here he took the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity</b> to demonstrate his main beliefs by practicing his strict public morality. He reduced official operating costs, walked his trips with a single assistant, and, by the studied lack of ceremony, placed his own frugality in striking contrast with the oppressive opulence of provincial magistrates. The rites of religion were celebrated with reasonable thrift, justice was administered with strict impartiality; usury was controlled with deep severity, and the usurers were banished. Sardinia had been for some time completely calmed, but according to Aurelius Victor, a revolt in the island was subdued by Cato during his Praetorship.|$|E
25|$|Article 26 of the Unification Treaty (Einigungsvertrag) {{between the}} two German states signed on 31 August 1990 {{established}} the DR as special property (Sondervermögen) of the Federal Republic of Germany, and stipulated the DR to be merged with DB at the <b>earliest</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Upon reunification, the DR and DB continued to operate as separate entities in their respective service areas, albeit under a coordination agreement concerning operations. On 1 June 1992, the DB and DR formed a joint board of directors which governed both entities. The merger between the DR and DB were delayed by several years over the structure of merged railway due to concerns by German politicians on the ever-increasing annual operating deficits incurred by the DB and DR.
