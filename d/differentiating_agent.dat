The authors have examined the status of NPY receptors in the NE cell line SK-N-MC and the effect of retinoic acid (RA), a known <b>differentiating</b> <b>agent,</b> on their expression and function. Methods: Competitive NPY binding studies were performed on normal and RA-treated cells, followed by Scatchard analysis. NPY receptor function in the absence of or following RA treatment was determined by the ability of various concentrations of NPY to attenuate the forskolin-stimulated accumulation of intracellular cAMP. The mitogenic effect of NPY was evaluated by growing normal or RA-treated cells in the presence of various concentrations of NPY. Results: Scatchard analysis showed a Kd of 2. 3 nmol/L and a Bmax of 91, 000 receptors per cell for untreated cells. RA treatment decreased receptor expression to 11, 700 per cell without a significant change in receptor affinity (3. 6 nmol/L). The effect of forskolin was inhibited by NPY in a dose-dependent fashion in both untreated and treated cells indicating functional receptors in both. NPY stimulates the growth of normal SK-N-MC cells. NPY stimulated growth was significantly attenuated after RA treatment, possibly as a result of decreased NPY receptor expression. Conclusions: Treatment of SK-N-MC cells with RA, a known <b>differentiating</b> <b>agent,</b> leads to decreased expression of functional NPY receptors and a concomitant decrease in the mitogenic effect of NPY.

We therefore analyzed the migrating and invasive potential of human HL- 60 and NB 4 cell lines, representative of acute myelogenous leukemia, their ability to express matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in response to <b>differentiating</b> <b>agents.</b> Granulocytic differentiation by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and aclacinomycin (ACLA) strongly increased HL- 60 and NB 4 cell migration and invasion. At mRNA and protein levels, these cell lines produced significant amounts of MMP- 9 (HL- 60 < NB 4). Granulocytic differentiation by ACLA increased both pro and active forms of MMP- 9 whereas ATRA decreased them and stimulated uPA mRNAs. TIMP- 1, the physiological MMP inhibitor, increased during granulocytic differentiation whereas TIMP- 2 did not significantly vary. Use of Batimastat and aprotinin suggests that ATRA was active by modulating the uPA system while ACLA interfered with MMP expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that HL- 60 and NB 4 cells express MMPs and uPA which are differentially regulated by the <b>differentiating</b> <b>agents</b> ATRA and ACLA and suggest the clinical usefulness of MMPs and serine protease inhibitors in the prophylaxis and treatment of the ATRA syndrome.

40|$|Purpose: Pharmacologic <b>differentiating</b> <b>agents</b> {{have had}} {{relatively}} limited clinical success {{outside of the}} use of ATRA in acute promyelocytic leukemia and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in myelodysplastic syndromes. The differentiating effects of such agents can be enhanced in combination with lineage-specific growth factors. We developed a dose finding trial to assess toxicity, differentiating activity, and clinical impact of the combination of bryostatin- 1 and GM-CSF. Experimental design: Patients with poor risk myeloid malignancies were eligible to enroll in a dose finding study of continuous infusion bryostatin- 1 combined with a fixed dose of daily GM-CSF. Toxicities were graded per NCI CTC version 2. 0 and pharmacokinetic and correlative study samples were obtained to assess the combination's clinical and biologic differentiating effects. Results: Thirty-two patients were treated with the combination therapy and the dose determined to be most suitable for study in a larger trial was continuous infusion broystatin- 1 at 16 μg/m 2 for 14 days and subcutaneous GM-CSF at 125 μg/m 2 daily for 14 days every 28 days. Arthralgias and myalgias limited further dose escalation. Clinically, the combination impacted differentiation with improvement of absolute neutrophil counts (p= 0. 0001) in the majority of patients. Interestingly, there were two objective clinical responses, including a CR after a single cycle. Both the bryostatin- 1 plasma concentrations and the correlative studies supported biologic activity of the combination at the doses where clinical responses were observed.

40|$|Restricted until 14 Apr. 2011. Neuroblastoma is a {{childhood}} neuroendocrine tumor, which originates from {{sympathetic nervous system}} precursors. The major indicator of poor prognosis for the disease is amplification of MYCN, a gene directly related to neuronal development. The developmental origins of the disease give it a highly heterogeneous character and biology, one that ranges from spontaneous regression and differentiation to aggressively recurring disease. The neuronal attributes of neuroblastoma and its capacity to differentiate have been successfully utilized in disease treatment by incorporating the <b>differentiating</b> <b>agent</b> 13 -cis-retinoic acid (13 -cis-RA) in the standard of care. Despite the fact that 13 -cis-RA treatment {{in the context of}} minimal residual disease (MRD) has improved event free survival, the outcome for high-risk neuroblastoma patients is still bleak, with approximately 50 % of patients succumbing to the disease. Such {{is the nature of the}} high-risk disease that novel combinations of therapy are required to battle its recurrence. In this body of work, we investigate the interactions of 13 -cis-RA with other chemotherapeutic agents, in neuroblastoma cell lines. We first describe an antagonistic relationship between 13 -cis-RA and several chemotherapeutic compounds, currently in use for neuroblastoma treatment.

Our studies also examine the effects of combining the <b>differentiating</b> <b>agent</b> 13 -cis-RA with the Histone Deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat (SAHA).
