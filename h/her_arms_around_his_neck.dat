2500|$|Gunnhild was {{the patron}} and lover of Hrut Herjolfsson (or Hrútur Herjólfsson), an Icelandic {{chieftain}} who visited Norway {{during the reign}} of Gunnhild's son Harald. This dalliance was all the more scandalous given the difference in their ages; the fact that Gunnhild was a generation older than Hrut was considered noteworthy. Gunnhild engaged in public displays of affection with Hrut that were normally reserved for married couples, such as putting <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> in an embrace.

2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. [...] In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "tears of mortification" [...] came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and [...] "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and tenderly kissed him." [...] Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. [...] The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.|$|E

6000|$|He {{admitted}} {{that she might be}} right; still speaking absently, still thinking of the Divorce.

5000|$|Pratt {{testified that}} it was Sullivan's idea to have him drive her home and her idea to stop in the woods. When they stopped, Sullivan got {{in the back seat}} and he followed.
