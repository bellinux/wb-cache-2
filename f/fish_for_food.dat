5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of the 1.5 million Laysan Albatrosses that inhabit Midway, {{nearly all}} {{are found to}} have plastic in their {{digestive}} system. Approximately one-third of the chicks die. These deaths are attributed to the albatrosses confusing brightly colored plastic with marine animals (such as squid and <b>fish)</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Recent results suggest that oceanic plastic develops a chemical signature that is normally used by seabirds to locate food items.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of catch and release is criticised by some who consider it unethical to inflict pain upon a fish {{for purposes of}} sport. Some of those who object to releasing fish do not object to killing <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Adherents of catch and release dispute this charge, pointing out that fish commonly feed on hard and spiky prey items, and as such {{can be expected to}} have tough mouths, and also that some fish will re-take a lure they have just been hooked on, a behaviour that is unlikely if hooking were painful. Opponents of catch and release fishing would find it preferable to ban or to severely restrict angling. On the other hand, proponents state that catch-and-release is necessary for many fisheries to remain sustainable, is a practice that generally has high survival rates, and consider the banning of angling as not reasonable or necessary.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2008 UN report, the world's fishing fleets {{are losing}} US$50 billion each year through {{depleted}} stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced {{jointly by the}} World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), asserts that half the world's fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch. In addition, the biomass of global fish stocks {{have been allowed to}} run down {{to the point where it}} is no longer possible to catch the amount of fish that could be caught. Increased incidence of schistosomiasis in Africa has been linked to declines of fish species that eat the snails carrying the disease-causing parasites. [...] Massive growth of jellyfish populations threaten fish stocks, as they compete with <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> eat fish eggs, and poison or swarm fish, and can survive in oxygen depleted environments where fish cannot; they wreak massive havoc on commercial fisheries. [...] Overfishing eliminates a major jellyfish competitor and predator exacerbating the jellyfish population explosion. Both climate change and a restructuring of the ecosystem have been found to be major roles in an increase in jellyfish population in the Irish Sea in the 1990s.|$|E
