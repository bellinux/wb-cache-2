60|$|Length of years, and {{subsequent}} reflection, have {{enabled me to}} trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English moralist and {{a portion of the}} character of Ligeia. An intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more <b>immediate</b> <b>evidence</b> of its existence. Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me--by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and placidity of her very low voice--and by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this would}} {{by no means}} satisfy the {{conditions}} of a scientific hypothesis. No man who is cautious would dream of trusting to an explanation of this kind simply because it explained one particular set of facts. Before you can possibly be safe in dealing with Nature--who is very properly made of the feminine gender, {{on account of the}} astonishing tricks which she plays upon her admirers!--I say before you can be safe in dealing with Nature, you must get two or three kinds of cross proofs, so as to make sure not only that your hypothesis fits that particular set of facts, but that it is not contradicted by some other set of facts which is just as clear and certain. And it so happens, that in this case Mr. Darwin supplied the cross proofs as well as the <b>immediate</b> <b>evidence.</b> You have all heard of volcanoes, those wonderful vents in {{the surface of the earth}} out of which pour masses of lava, cinders and ashes, and the like. Now, it is a matter of observation and experience that all volcanoes are placed in areas in which the surface of the earth is undergoing elevation, or at any rate is stationary; they are not placed in parts of the world in which the level of the land is being lowered. They are all indications of a great subterranean activity, of a something being pushed up, and therefore naturally the land either gives way and lets it come through, or else is raised up by its violence. And so Mr. Darwin, being desirous not to merely put out a flashy hypothesis, but to get at the truth of the matter, said to himself, [...] "If my notion of this matter is right, then atolls and encircling reefs, inasmuch as they are dependent upon subsidence, ought not to be found in company with volcanoes; and, 'vice versa', volcanoes ought not to be found in company with atolls, but they ought to be found in company with fringing reefs." [...] And if you turn to Mr. Darwin's great work upon the coral reefs, you will see a very beautiful chart of the world, which he prepared with great pains and labour, showing the distribution on the one hand of the reefs, and on the other of the volcanoes; you will find that in no case does the atoll accompany the volcano, or the volcano burst up among the atolls. It is most instructive to look at the great area of the Pacific on the map, and see the great masses of atolls forming in one region of it a most enormous belt, running from north-west to south-east; while the volcanoes, which are very numerous in that region, go round the margin, so that we can picture the Pacific to ourselves a section of a kind of very shallow basin--shallow in proportion to its width, with the atolls rising from the bottom of it, and at the margins the volcanoes. It is exactly as if you had taken a flat mass and lifted up the edges of it; the subterranean force which lifted up the edges shows itself in volcanoes, and as the edges have been raised, the middle part of the mass has gone down. In other words, the facts of physical geography precisely and exactly correspond with the hypothesis which accounts for the infinite varieties of coral reefs.|$|E

Given the emphasis many universities and funding agencies/governments are putting upon the development of PhD programmes, this is an issue deserving attention. The paper tries to show how two separate but interrelated questions ‘What is a doctorate worth?’ and ‘Is there a justification for society to subsidise the production of doctorates?’ might be answered. It considers the argument that the production of PhDs can generate benefits for wider society – both because the production process itself generates basic knowledge from which all can take advantage and because the outputs of that process help boost the productivity of those with whom they work. In other words, the gains to society as a whole might be greater than the sum of gains to PhD holders and their <b>immediate</b> employers. <b>Evidence</b> is reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Following core {{excitation}} in {{an isolated}} molecule, ultrafast dissociation of one particular chemical bond can occur, where "ultrafast" is defined as taking place during the lifetime of the core hole, {{of the order of}} few femtoseconds. The signature of such phenomenon can be observed in resonant Auger spectra following core excitation. We present here an investigation of ultrafast dissociation following C 1 s-to-sigma* core excitation in CF 4, with high-resolution resonant Auger spectroscopy. We are able to characterize final states of both the molecular ion and the CF 3 + fragment. We use two-dimensional (2 D) maps to record resonant Auger spectra across the resonance as a function of photon energy and to characterize ultrafast dynamics. This method provides <b>immediate</b> visual <b>evidence</b> of one of the important characteristics of the study of spectral features related to molecular versus fragment ionic final states, and namely their dispersion law. In the 2 D maps we are also able to identify the dissociation limit for one of the molecular final states. ...|$|R
40|$|The Author {{comments}} on {{some aspects of}} the new Italian rules concerning arbitration in respect of disputes related to companies, introduced by Legislative Decree n. 5 of 17 January 2003, which are relevant in the perspective of its application to international arbitration. In particular, it appears questionable whether these are intended to apply to all companies subject to Italian law, as part of the lex societatis, irrespective of the place of arbitration, or whether, to the contrary, they are to be deemed applicable to arbitration having its seat in Italy, irrespective of the nationality of the company concerned. The procedural effect of derogation from the jurisdiction of Italian courts tilts the balance in favour of the latter assumption. The Author therefore briefly examines the widely debated issue of the law applicable to the matter of substantive arbitrability, and, in particular, the alleged relevance of internationally mandatory rules (lois d'application <b>immédiate),</b> as <b>evidence</b> of the presence of public interests of a given State, which would render the matter unsuitable for arbitration...|$|R

Julfar was the first example of true urbanism in this part of Arabia, and therefore marks a significant historical turning point. Its development is believed to have been linked to the expanding mercantile economy of Hormuz, but it occurred at the same time as a period of spectacular rural growth in its own <b>immediate</b> hinterland, <b>evidence</b> for which has been produced by archaeological field survey.
