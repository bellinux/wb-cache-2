50|$|A drift meter, also <b>drift</b> <b>indicator</b> {{and drift}} sight, is an optical device {{used to improve}} dead {{reckoning}} for aircraft navigation. It consists of a small telescope extended vertically through {{the bottom of the}} aircraft with the eyepiece inside the fuselage at the navigator's station. A reticle, normally consisting of spaced parallel lines, is rotated until objects on the ground are seen to be moving parallel to the lines. The angle of the reticle then indicates the aircraft's drift angle due to winds aloft, and can be used to calculate the ground speed.|$|E
5000|$|Russia had {{a chance}} to become the birthplace of the first multi-passenger and multi-engine airliner. The Ilya Muromets was first {{conceived}} and built as a luxurious aircraft. For the first time in aviation history, it had an insulated passenger saloon, comfortable wicker chairs, a bedroom, a lounge and even the first airborne toilet. The aircraft also had heating and electrical lighting. [...] The S-22 cockpit had sufficient space allowing several persons to observe the pilot. Openings {{on both sides of the}} fuselage permitted mechanics to climb out onto the lower wings to service the engines during flight. A hatch on the left side provided an entry to the main cabin, behind the cockpit. The main cabin featured two large windows on each side. Further back was a private cabin which included a berth, small table and a cabinet. Lighting was provided by a wind-driven generator and heating was supplied by two long engine exhaust pipes which passed through the corners of the cabin. Despite many advancements, the flight instruments on the Ilya Muromets were primitive. They included four tachometers, one per engine, a compass, a crude altimeter and airspeed indicator, two glass V-shaped tubes and a ball for bank indication, and a series of horizontal bars situated vertically on the nose of the fuselage for measuring climbs and descents. Later, in the bomber variants, a <b>drift</b> <b>indicator</b> and elementary bombsight was added to aid bombing.|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{served on}} active duty during the First World War. He had the {{foresight}} to realize that aviation was going to expand rapidly in the next few years. [...] Byrd volunteered to become a naval aviator, took flying lessons and earned his pilot wings in August 1917. He developed a passion for flight, and pioneered many techniques for navigating airplanes over the open ocean including <b>drift</b> <b>indicators,</b> the sun compass and bubble sextants.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The littoral-drift regime {{along the}} {{north-eastern}} coast of India was investigated by analyzing coastal <b>drift</b> <b>indicators</b> and shoreline changes based on multi-temporal satellite images. The study of offshore turbidity patterns and quantitative estimation of suspended sediments was undertaken {{to understand the}} magnitude and direction of movement of sediment fluxes. The study revealed that: 1) the character of coastal landforms and sedimentation processes indicate that the sediment transport is bi-directional and monsoon dependant 2) multi-date, multi-temporal analysis of satellite images helps to show the nature of sediment transport along the coast. The dominant net sediment transport is in a NE direction along the eastern coast of India. Finally, this assessment demonstrates the potential of remote sensing technology in understanding the coastal morphometric changes, long term sediment transport, shoreline changes and offshore turbidity distribution pattern and the implications for the transport of sediment associated pollutants...|$|R
40|$|A head-worn display {{combined}} with accurate head-tracking {{allows one to}} show synthetically generated symbols {{in a way that}} they appear as a part of the real world. Depending on the specific research context, different terms have been used for the ability to show display elements as parts of the outside world. These include contact analog, scene linked, augmented reality, and outside conformal. While the famous highway in the sky was one of the first applications in avionics, over the years more and more conformal counterparts have been devised for aircraft-related instruments. Among them are routing information, navigation aids, specialized landing displays, obstacle warnings, <b>drift</b> <b>indicators,</b> and many more. Conformal displays have been developed for more than 40 years. We present a review of some results, as well as an insight in research trends for the next years. We suggest that naturalism is not the best choice for the design of conformal displays. Instead, more abstract representations often yield better pilot acceptance...|$|R
30|$|A {{commonly}} used behavioral proxy for the RHI is proprioceptive drift. But {{several studies have}} raised doubts about the reliability of <b>drift</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of the ownership experience for the rubber hand (Rohde, Luca, & Earnst, 2011; Zopf, Savage, & Williams, 2010; Ehrsson, Spence, & Passingham, 2004; Fiorio et al., 2011; Kammers et al., 2009). A more recent study, however, {{seems to suggest that}} although drift and ownership experience are positively correlated, crucially, it is the conscious experience that seems to be causing drift, not the reverse (Abdulkarim & Ehrsson, 2016). This is one of the factors motivating our focus on the conscious contents of the RHI.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} online {{monitoring}} of electrical machine winding insulation systems based on parametric modeling and identification. The proposed method consists in monitoring the <b>drift</b> of diagnostic <b>indicators</b> built from in-situ estimation of high-frequency electrical model parameters. The involved model structures {{are derived from}} the RLC network modeling of the winding insulation, with more or less lumped parameters. Because they often present an important modeling noise, the authors propose to use the output error method not only to estimate the model parameter values but also to evaluate their uncertainty. This process {{is based on the}} numerical integration of the model sensitivity functions. The so-called global identification scheme is coupled with an optimization algorithm that brings the closer combination of any diagnostic model structure and its excitation protocol usable in operating conditions. Experimental data recorded from an industrial wound machines are used to illustrate the methodology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{constructing}} a system of rating indicators for stimulating the work of the academic staff in higher educational institution. Many areas of teacher activity (for example, educational, scientific, international, etc.) laid the basis of selection the groups of indicators in the system. Social challenge in improving the quality of educational services determines the relevance of research in the field of modeling and prediction of indicators which characterize the work of high school teacher. To predict the dynamics {{of the structure of the}} rating indicators in the system, the authors introduced the concept of drift and variability of each group. Using informational hypercube for the structure of input data allowed authors to take into account the individual characteristics of each parameter included in a mathematical model to describe the rating indicators. To make the prediction of the structure and values of rating system indicators the authors introduced the concept of <b>drift.</b> <b>Drift</b> of <b>indicators</b> takes into account the introduction of new indicators, the removal of existing indicators, and movement of indicators between the groups. In the article, authors introduced a novel quantitative indicator of group variability. The value of this indicator determines the prediction strategy of the teacher work in higher school in the future period. To predict the total amount of stimulating, the complex technique offered and it includes four modules: modeling values within the existing range in the previous period; modeling new index value based on the assumptions introduced using a random number generator; exclusion a range of values of deleted indicators; modeling new values based on the study of the modern trend of indicators. The presence of flexible information structure in the form of a hypercube and complex mathematical model allowed authors to carry out numerical simulation for predicting the values of individual and group indicators. During the experiment, the structural stability of values is detected, and it does not lead to a drastic changing of the quantitative ratio between the groups of indicators...|$|R
40|$|Belt–pulley {{systems are}} widely used in the {{industry}} due to their high efﬁciency and their low cost. However, only few works exist about the monitoring of their degradation. This paper details the impact of belt looseness on electrical measurements under steady and transient state {{in order to identify}} spectral signatures. This analysis enlightens the advantage of the transient state to detect belt looseness because it exacerbates belt slip. An innovative methodology is then proposed based on the application of a square-wave speed reference in order to monitor belt looseness. A statistical-based indicator is deﬁned from the phase currents in order to automatically detect <b>drifting</b> of the <b>indicator.</b> A normalization process is also applied to increase the detection robustness. The proposed indicatoris evaluated on a 30 -kW induction machine and a direct current machine coupled with two trapezoidal belts for three speed and four load conditions. It reaches very good results with almost 90 % correct detections for 1 % false alarms. These results are way better than those obtained with a classic spectral analysis during the steady state. Moreover, results demonstrate that higher load conditions are more accurate for the monitoring of belt looseness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pedometric approach to updating the Dutch 1 : 50, 000 national soil map for the peatlands, and illustrates this approach for a 187, 525 ha {{area in the}} northern peatlands. This {{is the first time}} that digital soil mapping replaces conventional soil mapping in a nationwide, government-funded soil survey program in the Netherlands. Soil classes were updated indirectly through mapping two quantitative diagnostic soil properties: the thickness and starting depth of the peat layer. From these, five major soil groups could be constructed. Because the point data were zero-inflated, a two-step simulation approach was implemented. First, peat presence/absence indicators were simulated from probabilities of peat occurrence that were predicted with a generalized linear model. Second, conditional peat thickness values were simulated from kriging with external <b>drift</b> predictions. The <b>indicator</b> and peat thickness simulations were combined to obtain simulations of the unconditional peat thickness. A similar approach was followed for the starting depth. From the simulated soil properties, probability distributions of soil groups were derived. These groups were refined with information on (static) soil properties derived from the 1 : 50, 000 map to obtain soil classes according to the 1 : 50, 000 legend. The updated raster map was then incorporated in the 1 : 50, 000 polygon map. The prediction models were calibrated with legacy point data, that were updated for peat thickness before being used, in addition to a set of newly acquired point data. The uncertainty associated to the updated peat thickness values in the legacy dataset was quantified and accounted for by the prediction models. The peat thickness map and a map with three soil orders were validated with independent probability sample data. The overall purity of the soil order map was 66 % for both subareas. For subarea 1 this was a 12 % purity improvement compared to the current 1 : 50, 000 map, for subarea 2 this was 3 %. For subarea 1, the mean absolute error of the predicted peat thickness was 23. 5 cm, and the R 2 is 0. 50. For subarea 2 these accuracy measures were 30. 9 cm and 0. 65. We conclude that nationwide updating the 1 : 50, 000 map with pedometric techniques is feasible. In order to increase the value and usability of the legacy point data as well as the large set of newly acquired field observations and the updated 1 : 50, 000 map, we recommend installation of a soil monitoring network in the Dutch peatlands. </p...|$|R
