5|$|The {{concept of}} truthiness {{has emerged as}} a major subject of {{discussion}} surrounding U.S. politics during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> factual reporting and fact-based discussion.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one in five}} Croatian Jews {{survived the}} Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly {{one half of the}} {{surviving}} members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praška Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible.|$|E

5|$|Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, {{designed}} and oversaw {{construction of the}} new chapel. Cram sought to build a crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed on the Princeton campus. The university's president, John Grier Hibben, also had {{a stake in the}} project: student <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> Princeton's brand of mainline Presbyterianism was on the rise. An ordained minister, Hibben hoped the new chapel's majesty would inspire students to attend services of their own volition. Cram, a convert to High Church Episcopalianism from Unitarianism, also lent support to this aim.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta's brother and successor, Balša II, who also desired the city. Nothing {{is known about}} Balša's {{military}} conflict with Tvrtko except that the latter asked Venice, whose trading opportunities were threatened by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša's death in a 1385 battle with the invading Ottoman Turks. Balša's nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta's <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} between Nazi Germany (1933-1945) {{and the leadership}} of the Arab world encompassed contempt, propaganda, collaboration and in some instances emulation. Cooperative political and military relationships were founded on shared <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> common enemies, such as British and French imperialism, colonialism, communism, and Zionism. Hitler made warm statements about Islam as a religion and political ideology. However, official Nazi ideology also considered Arabs to be racially inferior to Germans.|$|R
50|$|Violence in {{the region}} has {{continued}} to rise. According to BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher, <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> AU peacekeepers are becoming more common. It has been noted that aid agencies are refusing to travel with African Union personnel, stating that {{the mere presence of}} the peacekeepers may draw fire. Kofi Annan, at a press conference in Geneva, responded to the rising violence by suggesting aid to the region may be partially suspended.|$|R
5|$|Tyler's {{difficulties}} in domestic policy contrasted with notable accomplishments in foreign policy. He {{had long been}} an advocate of expansionism toward the Pacific and free trade, and was fond of evoking themes of national destiny {{and the spread of}} liberty in support of these policies. His positions were largely in line with Jackson's earlier efforts to promote American commerce across the Pacific. Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets, he sent lawyer Caleb Cushing to China, where he negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Wanghia (1844). The same year, he sent Henry Wheaton as a minister to Berlin, where he negotiated and signed a trade agreement with the Zollverein, a coalition of German states that managed tariffs. This treaty was rejected by the Whigs, mainly as a show of <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> the Tyler administration.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E
5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows all too well about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death fifty years ago. The culprit, he reveals to Harry, was none other than Rubeus Hagrid, now gamekeeper for Hogwarts School; when Hermione is attacked next, alongside a Ravenclaw prefect, the school is put on lockdown, and Dumbledore and Hagrid are forced to leave the premises.|$|E
50|$|In 1894, {{one year}} after the area was reopened to missionaries, Church {{membership}} was 96. A decade later, missionaries encountered <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> the Church during the highly-publicized United States Senate hearings on Church leader and Senator-elect Reed Smoot, and police disallowed missionaries to hold open-air meetings. By 1930, membership was nearly 360, some of whom were recently-returned missionaries studying at Harvard University. Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the headquarters for the New England States Mission. A Church building was dedicated in the area in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Nationalization {{of history}} affects {{all aspects of}} life, from {{relationships}} with other nationalities to architecture. This {{is a result of}} the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature, and the fact that reservations and <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.|$|R

5|$|The 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence {{was issued}} by Charles II {{in an attempt}} to {{introduce}} greater religious freedom, and within Somerset, 82 places applied for licences to meet and worship, 22 of them for Baptists. However, the Declaration was withdrawn at the urging of Parliament the following year. This led to further <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> Dissenters, which were heightened after the failed Monmouth rebellion, in which a large number of Dissenters fought against the King's forces. After the Glorious Revolution removed James II, his successor William III introduced the Act of Toleration 1689, which specifically allowed nonconformist worship.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, {{a number}} of Al Murrah tribespeople, along with several members from the Bani Hajer tribe, renounced their {{allegiance}} to Qatar and departed from the country. The two families were joined by the Ajman tribe, whom were known to harbor <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> Qatar and regularly engage in skirmishes with its inhabitants. While the group was encamped in an area between Qatar and Oman, a regiment of 1,200 partisans composed of branches of Al Murrah and Bani Hajer loyal to the sheikh of Qatar engaged the group. Although the three tribes boasted a combined force of 2,000 men and outnumbered the opposition, they were inflicted with heavy losses.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Mahdi Ahmad of al-Ghirās, who is {{also known}} by the epithet Ṣafī al-Din (purity of religion), succeeded al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, but perpetuated the same <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> his Jewish {{subjects}} as those made by his predecessor. Everything reached its climax between the years 1677 and 1680, when he ordered {{the destruction of the}} synagogues in Sana'a and elsewhere. [...] By early summer of 1679, he gave an ultimatum unto his Jewish subjects, namely, that they had the choice of either converting to Islam, in which they’d be allowed to remain in the country, or of being killed by the sword. He gave to them three months to decide what they would do.|$|R
25|$|After 1914, the Buddhist element {{became much}} more nationalistic, and highly {{resistant}} to Christianity. There was <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> the Christian Karens, and toward Indian immigrants as well.

Increasingly, the native community {{took control of the}} Protestant organizations.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) gave {{explanations}} of the genesis of religion in his various writings.

25|$|Born circa 1915, Bửu Hội was {{a native}} of the former {{imperial}} capital of Huế. He was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Minh Mạng, who ruled Vietnam from 1820 until his death in 1841. Mạng had been a staunch Confucianist, known for his conservative philosophy, in which he shunned the western world and technological and scientific innovations. He resisted Catholic and Buddhist missionaries in Vietnam and was known for his <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> them, as he believed they were undermining the Emperor's Mandate of Heaven.|$|E
40|$|The {{likelihood}} that party loyalties reflect {{the characteristics of}} parties and political competition within specific political environments was generally ignored in critiques of party identification abroad. In this article, I identify substantial frequencies of stable partisan ties among British, Dutch, and German voters in the 1960 s through the 1980 s. Stable party loyalists in turn usually vote for their preferred party in subsequent elections. Long-term partisan ties are most common among supporters of traditional cleavage parties. These long-term party loyalties reflect the effects of both long-standing <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> opposing parties and well-developed party principles. Since partisan responses are internally consistent and subsume ideational as well as affective components, these feelings resemble social psychology's affect-laden schemata...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> Polish people {{reached a}} {{particular}} peak during World War II, when Poles became {{the subject of}} ethnic cleansing on an unprecedented scale, including: Nazi German genocide in General Government, Soviet executions and mass deportations to Siberia from Kresy, as well as massacres of Poles in Volhynia, a campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out in today's western Ukraine by Ukrainian nationalists. Millions of citizens of Poland, both ethnic Poles and Jews, died in German concentration camps such as Auschwitz. Unknown numbers perished in Soviet [...] "gulags" [...] and political prisons.Reprisals against partisan activities were brutal; on one occasion 1,200 Poles were murdered in retaliation for the death of one German officer and two German officials.|$|R
50|$|Father Rale's War was {{the first}} and only time Wabanaki would fight New Englanders and the British on their own terms and for their own reasons and not principally to defend French {{imperial}} interests. In response to Wabanaki <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> territorial expansion, the governor of Nova Scotia, Richard Phillips, built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso in 1720, and Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory around the mouth of the Kennebec River: Fort George at Brunswick (1715); St. George's Fort at Thomaston (1720); and Fort Richmond (1721) at Richmond. The French claimed the same territory by building churches in the Abenaki villages of Norridgewock (on the Kennebec River) and Medoctec (on the St. John River, four miles upriver from present-day Meductic, New Brunswick).|$|R

25|$|This bitter {{religious}} conflict {{contributed to}} <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> foreign Christians and Europeans, which persisted into the 20th century {{and was a}} factor in Ethiopia's isolation until the mid-19th century, when the first British mission, sent in 1805 to conclude an alliance with Ethiopia and obtain a port on the Red Sea in case France conquered Egypt. The success of this mission opened Ethiopia to many more travellers, missionaries and merchants of all countries, and the stream of Europeans continued until well into Tewodros's reign.|$|E
25|$|Pobedonostsev did {{develop a}} social {{program for the}} Church while {{limiting}} its autonomy. He imposed repressive measures against the non-Orthodox. He carried out major Church reforms, but they resulted in a church that by 1900 was enmeshed in bureaucracy, alienated in many ways from society, resentful of secular authorities, and divided internally. Stagnation in church and state policies prevailed until Pobedonostsev retired in 1905. In the long run, argues Polunov, Pobedonostsev's attempts to impose safe conservative barriers to reform and his <b>hostility</b> <b>toward</b> innovation served only to weaken the autocratic state from within.|$|E
50|$|The {{objectives}} conflicted, showing {{evidence of}} poor planning: raising taxes while ignoring {{the effect on}} private investments, reducing wasteful public expenditures while nevertheless raising salaries, raising money from bank stock without creating any regulatory rule for it, and an attempt to obtain external resources even with <b>hostility</b> growing <b>toward</b> the foreign capital.|$|R
5000|$|Father Rale's War {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of an expansion of British settlements along the Kennebec River (in present-day Maine) and of the movement of more New England fishermen into Nova Scotia waters (particularly at Canso, Nova Scotia). The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended Queen Anne's War, had facilitated this expansion. The treaty, however, had been signed in Europe and had not involved any tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy. None had been consulted and they protested through raids on British fishermen and settlements. [...] In response to Wabanaki <b>hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> the expansion, the Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Philipps built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso in 1720 and Massachusetts Governor Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The construction of these fortifications raised tensions which in 1722 spilled into open warfare.|$|R
5000|$|In 1272 the Mamluk Sultan {{invaded the}} Kingdom of Makuria, after its King David I had raided the Egyptian city of Aidhab, {{initiating}} several decades of intervention by the Mamlukes in Nubian affairs. <b>Hostilities</b> <b>toward</b> the dying Christian kingdom were sidelined as Baibars' invasion of Makuria continued {{for four years}} until, by 1276, Baibars had completed his conquest of Nubia, Including the Medieval lower Nubia which ruled by Banu Kanz.

In practice this was reducing Makuria to a vassal kingdom, effectively ending Makuria's status as an independent kingdom ...|$|R
