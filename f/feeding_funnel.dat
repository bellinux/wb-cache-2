40|$|Two recent {{publications}} {{dealing with}} the trace fossil Schaubcylindrichnus (Frey and Howard, 1981) in Cenozoic outcrops have been published independently {{in the same year}} (Löwemark and Hong, 2006; Nara, 2006). The two studies came to similar conclusions regarding morphology, somewhat different conclusions with respect to the behavior of the trace maker, and diametrically opposed conclusions regarding the ichnotaxonomy. The two studies (Löwemark & Hong, 2006; Nara, 2006) were published in parallel without taking the other into consideration. During the 2 nd International Ichnological Congress in Krakow 2008 the authors had the opportunity to compare their results (Löwemark and Nara, 2008). We therefore feel that a clarifying note is timely. Morphologically, S. coronus is shown to typically consist of three distinct parts: a bundle of thickly lined, often crossing tubes that have been constructed after each other, a <b>feeding</b> <b>funnel</b> connected to one end of the burrow system, and a fecal mound connected to the other end (Nara, 2006). Löwemark & Hong (2006) introduced a new ichnospecies, S. formosus, based on the differences in morphology to the original description of S. coronus that outlined a congruent bundle as the typical form. However, subsequent comparison of S. formosus with Nara's (2006) descriptions of S. coronus showed that the former can be accommodated in the latter. S. formosus therefore should be considered as a junior synonym of S. coronus and be abandoned...|$|E

These rollers are a safety feature and are generally reversible for situations where a branch gets caught on clothing.|$|R

As pushers often deal with fragile crystals, the movement of the pusher plate and acceleration in the <b>feed</b> <b>funnel</b> matter, because they can break some of the particles. In addition to the movement plate, G can cause breakage and compaction, and volatile matter in the cake increases. The gentle movement of cake in low G, single stage, long basket designs results in low particle attrition. As more solids pass through, residence time decreases, which increases volatile matter in the discharge cake.|$|R
40|$|Schaubcylindrichnus is an {{important}} trace fossil used in the characterization of offshore and shoreface depositional environments. Our understanding of this trace has followed a winding path including the introduction of several new ichnospecies and the subsequent recent synonymization into one ichnospecies. Likewise, {{our understanding of the}} ethological interpretation of the trace fossil has evolved from gregarious headdown deposit feeders to filter feeders, until it recently was shown that the tracemaker probably was a funnel feeder. Although several ichnospecies were recently synonymized into one ichnospecies, Schaubcylindrichnus coronus, variability in the number of tubes per sheaf and abundance of nested tubes, i. e., tubes that break up older tubes, were observed between different settings. These differences were studied in close detail at Miocene outcrops in Japan and Taiwan where the trace fossil occurs copiously and therefore allows the intraspecific morphological variability to be addressed. Around 2000 specimens from Japan and Taiwan were studied. The results show a distinct tendency for higher tube numbers in the offshore facies where sediments are characterized by higher silt/mud content, suggesting that S. coronus with higher tube numbers were constructed in a calm environment allowing longer dwelling periods. The increased abundance of nested tubes in settings characterized by thin sand layers indicate that the nested tubes are a reparation response to erosional events destroying the <b>feeding</b> <b>funnels</b> at the sediment-water interface. Consequently, tube number per sheaf and abundance of nested tubes may be used to further characterize the depositional environment in shoreface to offshore facies...|$|R

At the trap deployment depth, current speeds were typically low (~ 10 cm s− 1) and primarily tidal-driven (M 2 tidal component). Although advection was weak, the sediment trap may {{have been subject to}} hydrodynamical and biological (swimmer <b>feeding</b> on trap <b>funnel)</b> biases. Particulate organic carbon (POC) flux was generally low (2 km) fluxes measured from similarly productive iron-fertilized blooms. Although undertrapping cannot be excluded in shallow moored sediment trap deployment, we hypothesize that grazing pressure, including mesozooplankton and mesopelagic fishes, may be responsible for the low POC flux beneath the base of the winter mixed layer. The importance of plankton community structure in controlling the temporal variability of export fluxes is addressed in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|Current {{concern about}} {{biodiversity}} change associated with human impacts has raised scientific {{interest in the}} role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. However, studies on this topic face the challenge of evaluating and separating the relative contributions of biodiversity and environment to ecosystem functioning in natural environments. To investigate this problem, we collected sediment cores at different seafloor locations in Saanich Inlet and the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada, and measured benthic fluxes of oxygen and five nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate). We also measured 18 environmental variables at each location, identified macrofauna, and calculated a suite of species and functional diversity indices. Our results indicated that, examined separately, macrobenthic functional richness (FRic) predicted benthic flux better than species richness, explaining ~ 20 % of the benthic flux variation at our sites. Environmental variables and functional diversity indices collectively explained 62. 9 % of benthic flux variation, with similar explanatory contributions from environmental variables (21. 4 %) and functional diversity indices (18. 5 %). The 22. 9 % shared variation between environmental variables and functional diversity indices demonstrate close linkages between species and environment. Finally, we also identified <b>funnel</b> <b>feeding</b> as a key functional group represented by a small number of species and individuals of maldanid and pectinariid polychaetes, which disproportionately affected benthic flux rates relative to their abundance. Our results indicate the primary importance of environment and functional diversity in controlling ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, these results illustrate the consequences of anthropogenic impacts, such as biodiversity loss and environmental changes, for ecosystem functioning...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} are in abundance both {{in nature and}} in industry. They are of considerable interest to both the engineering and physics communities, due to their practical importance and many unsolved scientific challenges. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} “pressure dip” phenomenon underneath a granular pile (commonly known as the “sandpile problem”) which has attracted great attention in the past few decades. Underneath a sandpile that is formed by <b>funnel</b> <b>feeding,</b> a significant minimum (dip) in the vertical base pressure is often found below the apex where a maximum pressure is intuitively expected. Despite a large amount of work undertaken, a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. This thesis presents an extensive study investigating the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and also its implications on pressures in silos. The study started with a laboratory test programme of conical mini iron pellet piles. The results confirmed that the pressure dip is a robust phenomenon. It was shown that, under certain deposition radius with uniform deposition across the deposition area, a dip emerges firstly in a ring shape when the radius of the formed pile is small and comparable to the deposition radius. With the increase of the pile radius upon further deposition, the dip ring gradually evolves to a central dip as the pressure at outer radius eventually overtakes that in the centre. The magnitude of the dip was found to be significantly affected by the deposition rate but almost unaffected by the deposition height. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
