40|$|When the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> <b>law</b> sank, the {{casualties}} included a special 2 ̆ 2 division 2 ̆ 2 of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the allocation of}} power under the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> <b>law</b> between the Attorney General along with the Department of Justice and the independent counsel whose appointment the Attorney General has triggered. Although the law explicitly transfers much of an Attorney General 2 ̆ 7 s lawful power to an independent counsel, it does {{not go far enough}} in reallocating that power. Thus, it leaves a fundamental gap between what the current statute purports independent counsel to be and what it actually empowers independent counsel to accomplish. After an introduction in Part I, Part II of this article reviews the current legal provisions, including the allocations to independent counsel of powers that ordinarily would belong to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice. Part III considers some instances in which the powers that the law or custom reserves to the Attorney General have been exercised to complicate or impede the work of independent counsel. Part IV proposes statutory modifications that would allocate further power to independent counsel. Part V considers some of the challenges that would arise and the political consequences that might flow from these proposed statutory modifications. I conclude in Part VI that an empowered independent counsel might have better working interactions with an Attorney General and the Department of Justice, facilitating quicker and more satisfying outcomes to independent counsel investigations. In the alternative, even if empowering independent counsel vis-a-vis the Attorney General would result in more visible and frequent political showdowns—between Attorneys General and independent counsel or between Presidents and independent counsel—this too could be healthy for our larger governmental processes...|$|E

The expenditures we audited were those made by the Department of Justice (DOJ) between October 1, 2007, and March 31, 2008, from the permanent, indefinite appropriation (fund) for OSC-Fitzgerald. DOJ determined that the appropriation established by Public Law 100 - 202 to fund expenditures by independent counsels appointed pursuant to the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> <b>law</b> or other law is available to fund the expenditures of U.

To satisfy this requirement, we audit each expenditure processed by DOJ to determine whether it was: properly authorized and approved, supported by appropriate documentation, recorded accurately, and made in accordance with selected provisions of laws and regulations. On December 30, 2003, the then-Acting Attorney General appointed U. S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel to investigate whether officials of the current administration illegally disclosed the identity of an undercover Central Intelligence Agency officer. In March 2007, after a jury trial, an administration official was convicted of perjury, lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and obstruction of justice in the investigation. In July 2007, the President of the United States commuted the prison term imposed by the sentencing judge upon the administration official. The administration official dropped his appeal of his convictions in December 2007. Expenditures during this period relate to the official's appeal of his conviction of perjury and obstruction of justice charges, as well as some expenses paid during this period that were reimbursements of travel and lodging incurred during the trial and sentencing.

C. 594 (d) (2), (h) and 596 (c) (1) to report on a semiannual basis the expenditures from a permanent, indefinite appropriation established within the Department of Justice to fund independent counsel activities. Under 28 U. S. C. 596 (c) (2), we are required to audit the statement of expenditures prepared by any active independent counsels. For the 6 months ended March 31, 2007, there were no active independent counsels. However, we audited the statement of expenditures of Special Counsel Fitzgerald, who is authorized by the Department of Justice to fund his operation from the permanent, indefinite appropriation. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 amended title 28 of the United States Code to authorize the judicial appointment of independent counsels when the Attorney General determines that reasonable grounds exist to warrant further investigation of high-ranking government officials for certain alleged crimes. The <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> <b>law,</b> which expired on June 30, 1999, was intended to preserve and promote the accountability and integrity of public officials and of the institutions of the federal government.

As ordered by the Special Division, the Office of Independent Counsel Barrett, the last independent counsel to serve under the law, was terminated on May 3, 2006, and accordingly, no longer prepares a statement of expenditures. However, after that date, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) continued to perform administrative responsibilities and maintain the administrative records for the terminated office.
