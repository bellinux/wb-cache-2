40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to collect new data on the occurrence and levels of priority and emerging organic compounds in freshwater fishes sampled in the Rhone River. The 34 studied contaminants included alkylphenols (AP), bisphenol A (BPA), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE), perfluorinated compounds (PFC), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCD), <b>hexachloro-benzene</b> (HCB) and hexachloro-butadiene (HCBD). About 50 fish samples (individual specimens or pooled fishes) were collected from 3 sites located upstream and downstream of the Lyon metropolitan area in the Rhone River (France). Four species were caught at each site, namely: the barbel (Barbus barbus), the common bream (Abramis brama), the white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) and the chub (Squalius cephalus). Some contaminants were quantified in all the 32 fish samples analysed: 4 -nonylphenol, α...|$|E
40|$|Levels of {{persistent}} organic pollutants including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, <b>hexachloro-benzene,</b> hexachlorohexanes, dieldrin, chlordane, mirex, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were measured in ooligan fish (Thaleichthys pacificus) prepared in the way usually consumed and in ooligan grease collected from five communities (Nass River, Kitimaat, Bella Coola, Kingcome Inlet, and Knights Inlet) in the coastal area of British Columbia, Canada. Levels of chlorinated pesticides and PCB increased from the north to the south, with the lowest from Nass River and highest from Knights Inlet. Average levels {{of persistent}} organic pollutants (110 ng/g lipid of total chlorinated pesticide and 30 ng/g lipid of PCB) were lower than those reported in fish from the Great Lakes and similar to those from the Arctic and were below the regulation limits established by Health Canada. Therefore, consumption of ooligan grease presents minimal health risk from organochlorine exposure. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that most {{persistent}} toxic substances have hardly been primarily emitted for several decades, their concentrations are only slowly decreasing in the global oceans. Surface seawater samples were collected along a 38 ° – 24 ° N/ 28 ° – 67 ° W transect in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. While the concentration levels of <b>hexachloro-benzene</b> (2. 1 – 6. 1 pg L− 1), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT,upto 2. 1 pgL− 1) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB, 10. 8 – 24. 9 pg L − 1) were in the same range as observed earlier in the North Atlantic, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, 90 – 627 pg L− 1) was found elevated, partly also relative to previous measurements in the same sea region. Hereby, the ratio α-HCH/γ-HCH was very low, 0. 09 – 0. 13. Chlordane and endosulfan were found in the range < 3. 0 – 11. 1 and < 5. 8 – 8. 8 pg L− 1 respectively. DDT metabolites, endrin and related pesticides were found below quantification limits. Spatial pollution patterns in surface seawaters seem to be determined by atmospheric and oceanic transport patterns, rather than by mixing and air-sea equilibrium. The comparison with global multicompartment chemistry-transport model predictions of surface seawater levels indicate underestimated degradation of PCBs and overestimated emissions of endosulfan...|$|E

Some contaminants were quantified in all the 32 fish samples analysed: 4 -nonylphenol, Α-HBCD, the 6 PBDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid. And 23 of the 32 samples had concentration of PFOS above the Environmental Quality Standards (up to 6 times higher the EQS); and all the 32 samples had concentrations of PBDE above the EQS (up to 4000 times higher, with the sum of 6 PBDE varying from 4. 5 to 182 ng/g dw). Clearly, the interest to consider PFOS and HBCD as new priority substances is confirmed. In contrast, the pertinence of a priority status for HCBD, which was never quantified in our study, might have to be reconsidered in the future...|$|E
40|$|Overexpression of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway {{disrupts}} cell-cell interactions, an epigenetic event {{leading to}} epithelial cell transformation. Female rats exposed to <b>hexachloro-benzene</b> (HCB) for 5 consecutive days and sampled 45 days later show {{a decrease in}} liver gap junctional intercellular communica-tion. We hypothesized that HCB also alters E-cadherin expression and that this alteration is mediated by the ILK pathway. Hepatic ILK levels were markedly increased in HCB-treated female rats. Cytoplasmic/membrane levels of protein kinase B (Akt), a target of ILK, and its phosphorylated active form were decreased in treated female rats. Flow cytometric analysis showed a concomi-tant increase in nuclear Akt levels. Both ILK and Akt can phos-phorylate glycogen synthetase kinase- 3 b (GSK 3 b), rendering it inactive. Phosphorylated-GSK 3 b levels were higher in treated females and resulted in a twofold decrease in the activity of GSK 3 b. The inactivation of GSK 3 b in HCB-treated female rats resulted in the nuclear translocation of b-catenin, as demon-strated by both immunocytochemistry and flow cytometric ana-lyses. Western blot analysis showed an 84 % decrease in E-cadherin levels in HCB-treated rats as compared to controls, and this decrease was not mediated by Snail activation. Mimicking the activation of ILK with specific GSK 3 b inhibitors resulted in downregulation of E-cadherin levels but {{had no effect on}} Cx 32 expression in the MH 1 C 1 cells. Overall, these results indicate that hepatic E-cadherin is downregulated {{as a result of an}} overexpres-sion of the ILK pathway. The concomitant HCB-induced down-regulation of intercellular communication does not occur as a result of either E-cadherin downregulation or GSK 3 b inactivation.
