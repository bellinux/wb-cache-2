500|$|In the {{run up to}} World Group {{play-off}} against Croatia, Tim Henman {{had announced}} he would retire after this match. Murray said [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> let the team down or let Tim down, I'd feel terrible if I {{was the one that}} was responsible for losing Tim's last tie. This {{means a lot to me}} and it's definitely going to be the biggest Davis Cup match of my career." [...] "Everyone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> win for Tim. I'm hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me." [...] Great Britain beat Croatia 4–1 to qualify for the World Group in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] {{could have been used}} as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of The Lion King coincided {{with that of}} Pocahontas, {{which most of the}} animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job [...] "because the story wasn't very good", and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft [...] "I don't know who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch that one." [...] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] sequence, were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King. Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.|$|E

500|$|On April 20, 1973, {{while waiting}} for his mother, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg, {{to come home from}} a party, Kemper fell asleep and was then awakened by her arrival. While his mother was sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, [...] "I suppose you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sit up all night and talk now." [...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.

2500|$|Chapman {{appeared}} in Captain Britain and MI: 13, as explained by writer Paul Cornell, [...] "One {{of the great}} things about this title is that, because all British superheroes are de facto part of MI-13, we can visit disparate parts of the Marvel UK scene without it being a big deal. Joe (not 'Joey', who's called Joey? Okay, kangaroos in Aussie, but apart from that...) is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> check in with [...] soon.

I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [...] It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all.

[...] The reviewer for Official Xbox Magazine noted that its [...] "combat and controls are quite good, and yet it feels a bit sleepy." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements felt that the game's escort missions were frustrating and hurt {{the pace of the}} game. [...] GameSpot's Brett Todd agreed and also expressed disappointment with the lack of online multiplayer. [...] Tyler Cameron of XBLA Fans also noted frustration with Aquas escort missions but lauded the campaign length. [...] "Most XBLA titles are short and can often be finished in a day [...] Aqua’s campaign feels appropriate for the price, and doesn’t overstay its welcome." [...] Cameron further noted that the game's replay value is extended by hidden items and other features to discover in the campaign. [...] 1UP.com's Eric Neigher appreciated the game's basic gameplay. [...] He called it a [...] "simple game with a lot of simple fun to be had." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed gave high remarks {{in regards to}} Aquas customization and upgrade system which when combined with the game's story gives Aqua [...] "a personality of its own." [...] GameZone's David Sanchez gave the PC version a 4.5 out of 10. He stated [...] "Naval Warfare shouldn’t take you too long to play through. But because the game gets boring so fast, you’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> finish the entire adventure. The game has some redeeming qualities in its Skirmish and multiplayer modes, but these are short-lived." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Lost Hero {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans. Publishers Weekly gave The Lost Hero a favorable review, {{and stated that}} [...] "Riordan's storytelling is as polished as ever, brimming with wit, action, and heart". The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the [...] "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" [...] and that [...] "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." [...] However, she also noted that there are [...] "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" [...] and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that [...] "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping {{that it does not}} end with a third Great Prophecy". The Seattle Times Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix [...] "fascinating" [...] and also said that the [...] "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action". Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating [...] "I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way. You’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> miss this one!" [...] but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that [...] "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail." [...] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said [...] "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." ...|$|E
