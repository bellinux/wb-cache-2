50|$|The {{community}} of Eight Mile, Alabama had a spill {{of the natural}} <b>gas</b> <b>odorant</b> within their community in 2008. Residents continue to experience these symptoms under their long term exposure to mercaptan. The residents say they got {{very little of the}} assistance provided to Porter Ranch residents. Methyl mercaptan is toxic if inhaled according to its MSDS sheet. However, it is considered fairly harmless by government and industry officials. Whether it {{is the source of the}} illnesses in Porter Ranch and Eight Mile has been a subject of debate.|$|E
50|$|A major spur to the {{development}} of <b>gas</b> <b>odorants</b> and odorizers was the March 18, 1937 natural gas leak that blew up a school in New London, Texas, killing 294 children and teachers.|$|R
50|$|Natural gas {{distributors}} {{were required}} to add thiols, originally ethanethiol, to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many gas distributors were odorizing gas prior to this event. Most <b>gas</b> <b>odorants</b> utilized currently contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with t-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and ethanethiol in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid petroleum gas tankers and bulk handling systems, an oxidizing catalyst is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.|$|R

5000|$|... tert-Butylthiol is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} in many <b>gas</b> <b>odorant</b> blends. It is always utilized as a blend of other compounds, typically dimethyl sulfide, methyl ethyl sulfide, tetrahydrothiophene or other mercaptans such as isopropyl mercaptan, sec-butyl mercaptan and/or n-butyl mercaptan, due to its rather high melting point of -0.5 C. These blends are used only with natural gas and not propane, as the boiling points of these blends and propane are quite different. As propane is delivered as a liquid and vaporizes to gas when being delivered to the appliance, the vapor liquid equilibrium would substantially {{reduce the amount of}} odorant blend in the vapor.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Mercaptan spill (natural <b>gas</b> <b>odorant)</b> == Lightning {{struck a}} {{mercaptan}} storage tank in 2008 at a Mobile Gas Service Corp. underground natural gas pipeline at the Whistler Junction gas transfer facility within the Eight Mile community. An estimated 500 gal of Mercaptan, the chemical odorant added to {{natural gas to}} help detect leaks, spilled into the soil and groundwater for 6 months, according to Alabama state environmental officials. It has migrated to ponds and surfaced, polluting the community's air. Beginning in 2011, residents in Eight Mile began complaining of an overwhelming mercaptan odor and health problems. They have concerns about the damage to their health from the chemical, and to property values from its persistent rotten egg smell.|$|E
5000|$|An {{artificial}} volcano {{along the}} Strip that [...] "erupts" [...] nightly at 7PM and 8PM, plus 9PM on Friday and Saturday. After sister property Bellagio opened, the design firm WET Enterprises improved the technology behind the volcano effect {{to make it}} more spectacular in 1996. To avoid the smell of uncombusted natural <b>gas</b> <b>odorant,</b> the mercaptan is stripped from the natural gas and a pina colada fragrance is added to the natural gas stream. The Volcano closed for a second and more elaborate renovation in February 2008 and reopened on December 8, 2008. A new soundtrack, complete with the sounds of actual volcanoes erupting, and featuring the work of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, has been included for an even more enhanced experience.|$|E
50|$|Many thiols {{have strong}} odors {{resembling}} that of garlic. The odors of thiols, {{particularly those of}} low molecular weight, are often strong and repulsive. The spray of skunks consists mainly of low-molecular-weight thiols and derivatives. These compounds are detectable by the human nose at concentrations of only 10 parts per billion. Human sweat contains (R)/(S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (MSH), detectable at 2 parts per billion and having a fruity, onion-like odor. (Methylthio)methanethiol (MeSCH2SH; MTMT) is a strong-smelling volatile thiol, also detectable at parts per billion levels, found in male mouse urine. Lawrence C. Katz and co-workers showed that MTMT functioned as a semiochemical, activating certain mouse olfactory sensory neurons, attracting female mice. Copper {{has been shown to}} be required by a specific mouse olfactory receptor, MOR244-3, which is highly responsive to MTMT as well as to various other thiols and related compounds. A human olfactory receptor, OR2T11, has been identified which, in the presence of copper, is highly responsive to the <b>gas</b> <b>odorants</b> (see below) ethanethiol and t-butyl mercaptan as well as other low molecular weight thiols, including allyl mercaptan found in human garlic breath, and the strong-smelling cyclic sulfide thietane.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a solid trap/thermal desorption-based <b>odorant</b> <b>gas</b> {{condensation}} {{system has}} been designed and implemented for measuring low concentration <b>odorant</b> <b>gas.</b> The technique was successfully applied to a medical electronic nose system. The developed system consists of a flow control unit, a temperature control unit and a sorbent tube. The theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that gas condensation, together with the medical electronic nose system can significantly reduce the detection limit of the nose system and increase the systemâ€™s ability to distinguish low concentration gas samples. In addition, the integrated system can remove the influence of background components and fluctuation of operational environment. Even with strong disturbances such as water vapour and ethanol gas, the developed system can classify the test samples accurately...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis study is to assess the {{feasibility}} of using a fiber sorbent module system to remove t-butyl mercaptan (TBM), a common odorant, from pipeline grade natural <b>gas.</b> <b>Odorants</b> such as mercaptans are added to natural gas for safety reasons, but their combustion products are corrosive and decrease the lifetime of the turbines {{in which they are}} combusted. Therefore, it is desirable to remove the odorants to extend this lifetime. A TBM removal system attached to a 840 MW natural gas-fueled combined cycle power plant unit such as the one at Plant McDonough-Atkinson (Smyrna, GA) must process gas at a flow rate of approximately 180, 000 standard cubic feet per minute. A single 85 MW GE 7 EAQ gas turbine has a flow rate of approximately 15, 000 standard cubic feet per minute, and will {{serve as the basis for}} a system design and process analysis study. The concentration of <b>odorants</b> in natural <b>gas</b> is typically 10 ppm or less. For the purposes of this study, the upper limit of 10 ppm TBM will be used. Zeolite 13 X was selected as the model adsorbent for this study due to its high sorption capacity for mercaptans and its ease of incorporation into both fibers and pellets. Design calculations were performed to optimize and determine the feasibility of fiber modules for TBM removal, as well as assess their advantages over conventional pellet packed beds. An understanding of how critical parameters such as heat and mass transfer resistances, pressure drop, and capital and operating costs are affected by design specifications such as sorbent and bed dimensions, allows an optimal design for the needs of the model turbine to be found. Based on these design equations, a fiber sorbent module configuration that selectively and continuously removes TBM from natural gas is developedM. S...|$|R
40|$|Variability in soil mineralogy, texture, and {{pavement}} cover {{are involved}} in events leading to undetected gas leaks and sebsequent explosions in Bowie, Md and Washington, D. C. These geologic parameters {{are involved in}} selectively removing the <b>gas</b> <b>odorant</b> additive t-butyl merceptan as the gas {{came into contact with}} the soil near the pipeline breaks. This removal resulted in an accumulation of combustable natural gas without detectable odor. Soil samples from drill holes and near surface sites were utilized to map soil type, texture, and mineralogy. Residual methane content of the samples was also measured. The data from two dissimilar sites indicates that fine-grained soil enriched in montmorillonite preferentially removes the odorant. ...|$|E
40|$|T HE LITERATURE {{is replete}} with {{descriptions}} and criticisms of methods of olfactometry (1 - 4). It is generally agreed that measurement of olfactory perception thresholds in man is fraught with difficulties in the subject and in the technique. Variability related to distraction and suggestion can be partly overcome by proper training of the subjects. A variety of physical variables must be understood and controlled {{in order to achieve}} a satisfactory technique of threshold measurement. There is need for high purity of the odorant since even small amounts of impurities impart an odor and such impurities vary in concentration from sample to sample. Mullins (5) has suggested the use of bottled <b>gases</b> as <b>odorants</b> and in par-ticular the use of n-butane with water-pumped nitrogen as the nonodorous diluent stream. Such gases are available in a high state of purity and have the additional advantage of bein...|$|R
5000|$|Hydrogen {{collects}} under {{roofs and}} overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building {{that contains a}} potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away {{from the rest of}} the structure in an explosion. It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations. Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence. Hydrogen sensors allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down. As in natural <b>gas,</b> an <b>odorant</b> can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR flame detectors. Chemo-chromic indicators can be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes. http://www.detectape.com/ ...|$|R
40|$|Confinement {{buildings}} {{are one of}} the most likely sources of odor in a broiler operation. The buildings must be ventilated, either mechanically with fans or relying on natural airflow, to prevent animal mortality and enhance animal health. Consequently, odors generated within the building are carried to the surrounding environment by the ventilation system. This review addresses the management of those factors that affect the production and removal of odorants in a broiler production operation. Published literature does not specifically discuss odor generation within broiler houses. Several studies deal with ammonia (an <b>odorant</b> <b>gas)</b> or particulate matter (a pollutant thought to carry <b>odorant</b> <b>gases)</b> emissions in broiler houses. These studies are discussed and inferences are made about the generation of odors under similar conditions. Conditions that lead to higher moisture in the litter tend to increase ammonia release, and by inference, more odorant release. Higher litter moisture is presumed to encourage greater microbial degradation of uric acid excreted by the birds into the litter and release more ammonia. Evaporative coolers may produce excess water droplets that fall to the litter rather than evaporate to cool the incoming air. Broiler houses that use misting systems generally have higher moisture content in the litter at the inlet end of the house. Either type of evaporative cooling system may also reduc...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} e-nose {{network system}} is {{developed for the}} special purpose of monitoring <b>odorant</b> <b>gases</b> and accurately estimating odor strength in and around livestock farms. This system is to simultaneously acquire accurate odor strength values remotely at various locations, where each node is an e-nose that includes four metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors. A modified Kalman filtering technique is proposed for collecting raw data and de-noising based on the output noise characteristics of those gas sensors. The measurement noise variance is obtained in real time by data analysis using the proposed slip windows average method. The optimal system noise variance of the filter is obtained by using the experiments data. The Kalman filter theory on how to acquire MOS gas sensors data is discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can adjust the Kalman filter parameters and significantly reduce the noise from the gas sensors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{claims have}} been made {{regarding}} the effectiveness of chemical additives and amendments (A&As) to reduce the potential for odors from organic residuals. Various A&As {{have been added to}} biosolids during conditioning and dewatering, or directly to dewatered cake, with limited success. The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) annually produces> 200, 000 wet tons of biosolids via anaerobic digestion, followed by high speed centrifuge dewatering. Nuisance odors were reported during staging / storage of biosolids cake at the Philadelphia Biosolids Recycling Center, and land application sites. This manuscript summarizes results for several A&As that was evaluated relative to their potential to reduce odors in staged and/or stored PDW biosolids. Conventional head space sampling from incubated biosolids samples and GC-MS analysis was coupled with human sensory evaluation. Of the A&As selected for study, none were effective for both staging and storage odor mitigation situations. Lime kiln dust performed best for staging, and high carbon wood ash performed best for storage.

40|$|Odour {{emissions}} from meat chicken sheds can at times cause odour impacts on surrounding communities. Litter {{is seen as}} the primary source of this odour. Formation and emission of odour from meat chicken litter during the grow-out period are influenced by various factors such as litter conditions, the environment, microbial activity, properties of the odorous gases and management practices. Odour emissions vary spatially and temporally. This variability has made it challenging to understand how specific litter conditions contribute to odour {{emissions from}} the litter and production sheds. Existing knowledge on odorants, odour formation mechanisms and emission processes that contribute to odour emissions from litter are reviewed. Litter moisture content and water thermodynamics (i. e. water activity, A) are also examined as factors that contribute to microbial odour formation, physical litter conditions and the exchange of individual <b>odorant</b> <b>gases</b> at the air-water interface. Substantial opportunities exist for future research on litter conditions and litter formation mechanisms and how these contribute to odour emissions. Closing this knowledge gap will improve management strategies that intercept and interfere with odour formation and emission processes leading to an overall reduction in the potential to cause community impacts...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{thresholds}} {{are typically}} obtained by presenting a subject with serial dilutions of an odorant. Many factors, including the solvent used to dilute the odorant, {{can influence the}} measurement of detection thresholds. Differences {{have been reported in}} detection thresholds for phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) when different solvents are used. In this study we used gas chromatography (GC) to investigate further the effect of solvent on odor detection thresholds. We used a single ascending method and serial dilutions of PEA in four different solventsâ€”liquid paraffin (LP), mineral oil (MO), propylene glycol (PG) and dipropylene glycol (DPG) â€”to determine the PEA thresholds for 31 adult subjects. For each solvent, we prepared eight serial log base 10 step dilutions (1 â€“ 8), with corresponding liquid PEA concentrations of 6. 3 Ã— 101 â€“ 6. 3 Ã— 10 â€“ 6 (% v/v). We found that the threshold concentrations for PEA in LP (step 6. 5) and PEA in MO (step 5. 5) were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than for PEA in PG (step 4. 0) and DPG (step 4. 0). We then used GC to measure both the liquid and gas PEA concentrations for the dilution steps prepared with LP and PG. Although there were large threshold differences in the liquid concentrations of PEA in LP and PG, the headspace gas concentrations of PEA were the same. These results demonstrate the importance of determining the <b>gas</b> concentration of <b>odorant</b> stimuli when performing odor threshold measurements, in particular when comparing odor detection thresholds obtained using different solvents.
