500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] in {{his list}} of the album's top four tracks. Although J. Edward Keyes of Newsday {{described}} the track as [...] "exuberant", he was critical of its placement on the album: [...] "The production, courtesy of the reliable Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, feels boilerplate at best. At 17 songs, the record is far too long, {{and by the time}} the exuberant 'Up Out My Face' arrives, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was grafted on from a better record." [...] Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that Carey lacked conviction in her approach to the song, writing that despite its aggressive tone, [...] "restraint stops serving her agenda".|$|E
500|$|... "S" [...] {{was written}} by Ester Dean in {{collaboration}} with the song's producers, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spore was {{originally}} a working title, suggested by Maxis developer Ocean Quigley, {{for the game}} which was first referred to {{by the general public}} as SimEverything. Even though SimEverything was a first choice name for Wright, the title Spore stuck. Wright adding it also freed him from the preconceptions another Sim title would have brought, saying [...] "...Not putting 'Sim' in front of it was very refreshing to me. <b>It</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> wants to be breaking out into a completely different thing than what Sim was." [...] Wright was inspired by the Drake equation and the 1977 film Powers of Ten when developing Spore.|$|E

2500|$|The plot of Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{met with}} a mixed reception. Destructoid {{described}} it as [...] "dull" [...] and observed that it [...] "struggles to find a foothold because it spends far too long without an easily-identifiable conflict." [...] Andy Hartup of GamesRadar felt that the game lacked the nuance of previous installments, writing, [...] "There’s {{a general lack of}} subtlety and finesse to this game’s storytelling, and much of <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> missed the point about what made the original trilogy such a success." [...] IGN remarked that the plot was sometimes derivative of prior games in the series, using the Remnant as an example, which they felt was simply another [...] "long-dead civilization that’s left advanced technology lying around". By contrast, VideoGamer.com listed the game's plot as a positive, likening it to a Hollywood hero story. Reflecting on his experience with the game, Polygons Arthur Gies wrote, [...] "The story in Andromeda is pretty good, with a number of mysteries on the critical path and some really interesting optional content." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey wrote [...] "Luxoflux have turned a slightly above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate {{has a knack for}} chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller accused the game of being [...] "so riddled with problems that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays. He cited [...] "collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. [...] the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was rushed {{to make it to}} store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E

The truth is, even if I were with a heterosexual guy, I'd be a queer dyke." [...] In addition, [...] "she describes herself as 'equal opportunity'. She doesn't like the word 'bisexual' - it's too polarizing." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The Postman’s White Nights” {{is being}} widely celebrated as a quasi-documentary, {{marked by a}} droll sense of humor that {{illuminates}} life in a forgotten corner of the world.

If it presents an accurate picture of this reality, then <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it’s</b> a reality that is unstable, so far {{cut off from the}} mainstream of life that it has begun to fray into the surreal and the magic at the edges." ...|$|R

5000|$|The A.V.

I suspect some of {{that goes back to}} the problem that hung over so much of the third season, as Arrow {{struggled}} to make all the business with Ra's al Ghul compelling.
