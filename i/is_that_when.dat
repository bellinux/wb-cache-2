5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> TREM2 is mutated, white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions {{it has to be}} extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{family was}} from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley. The modern {{historian}} Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald {{may have been a}} distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's family came from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name. His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which {{makes it easy to}} turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

25|$|When {{evaluated}} {{in the following}} order, , this can be computed using only integer arithmetic. The reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> each division occurs, the intermediate result that is produced is itself a binomial coefficient, so no remainders ever occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{down side}} however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> monsoon rains are weak, crop {{production}} is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply. As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department {{to produce more}} drought resistant crops.|$|E
25|$|A {{more general}} {{guideline}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Tachanun (supplication prayer) is omitted, it {{is permitted to}} deliver a brief eulogy emphasizing only the praise of the departed; the extensive eulogy is postponed, and may be said at another time during the year of mourning.|$|E

Wine from the island was denoted, “vin” or “vino” to denote the packages contents; thus, the term “Vinsanto” was born.|$|E

25|$|A curiosity of the J-3 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it is flown solo, {{the lone}} pilot {{normally}} occupies {{the rear seat}} for proper balance, to balance the fuel tank located at the firewall.

25|$|A {{general rule}} in xiangqi endgames for the {{advantageous}} side <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> there's less {{material on the}} board, do not trade pieces easily, as with fewer attacking pieces on the board, defending is easier. Hence, if {{a certain type of}} endgame can transpose, by trading pieces, into another type of endgame which is a book win, then this endgame itself is a book win.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that when prices are {{presented}} to a prospect in descending order (versus ascending order) positive effects result, mainly a willingness to pay a higher price, higher perceptions of value, and higher probability of purchase. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> presented in the former, the higher price serves as a reference point, and the lower prices are perceived favorably as a result.|$|E
25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of this design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> steering is applied {{the engine power}} {{is removed from the}} track. This makes the tank slow down, even if the brake is not applied. If the tank is climbing, or in soft terrain, forward motion may stop entirely. Another disadvantage is that the brakes slowed the vehicle as dissipated heat, which made this concept unsuitable for larger designs which required massive brakes to avoid overheating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main reason}} <b>that</b> halfpennies <b>were</b> issued <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> shillings <b>were</b> decimalised they were worth five new pence, so a sixpence (half of a shilling) yielded {{a value of}} [...] new pence.|$|R
