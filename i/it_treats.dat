5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|The goddess-oriented Shakti {{tradition}} of Hinduism {{is based on}} the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia General Assembly is {{the oldest}} {{continuous}} law-making body in the New World. The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008. It is unique in how <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.|$|E
25|$|Minkowski {{space is}} closely {{associated}} with Einstein's theory of special relativity, and {{is the most common}} mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to length contraction and time dilation, in Minkowski spacetime, all frames of reference will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events. Because <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> time differently than <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Manzoni's The Betrothed (1842) is an {{historical}} novel {{taking place in}} Italy in 1629. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> a couple whose marriage is interrupted by the bubonic plague, and other complications of Thirty Years' War.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest APBI {{may reduce}} the side effects {{associated}} with radiation therapy, because <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> only the tumor cavity and the surrounding tissue. In particular, a device that uses multiple catheters and allows modulation of the radiation dose delivered by each of these catheters {{has been shown to}} reduce harm to nearby, healthy tissue.|$|E
25|$|The legendary {{period of}} Spartan history is {{believed}} {{to fall into the}} Dark Age. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> the mythic heroes such as the Heraclids and the Perseids, offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{members of this}} group of drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, all available over the counter in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only little anti-inflammatory activity. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much {{in the rest of the}} body.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the past}} decade, a new {{approach}} called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has gained popularity. APBI is used to deliver radiation as part of breast conservation therapy. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> only {{the area where the}} tumor was surgically removed, plus adjacent tissue. APBI reduces the length of treatment to just five days, compared to the typical six or seven weeks for whole breast irradiation.|$|E
25|$|The former was {{published}} in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the phenomena, but omits all details. It contains {{a summary of the}} history of astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of French literature, though it is not altogether reliable for the later periods of which <b>it</b> <b>treats.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zillions of Games is a {{commercial}} general game playing system developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler in 1998. The game rules are specified with S-expressions, Zillions rule language. It {{was designed to}} handle mostly abstract strategy board games or puzzles. After parsing {{the rules of the}} game, the system's artificial intelligence can automatically play one or more players. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> puzzles as solitaire games and its AI can be used to solve them.|$|E

50|$|The SSN is {{frequently}} used by {{those involved in}} identity theft, since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for <b>it</b> <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as an authenticator. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up bank accounts, credit cards, and loans—partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.|$|R
25|$|This {{model is}} even more {{approximate}} than the model of hydrogen, because <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> the electrons in each shell as non-interacting. But the repulsions of electrons {{are taken into account}} somewhat by the phenomenon of screening. The electrons in outer orbits do not only orbit the nucleus, but they also move around the inner electrons, so the effective charge Z that they feel is reduced by the number of the electrons in the inner orbit.|$|E
25|$|For a man it’s {{certainly}} hard to {{be truly}} good—perfect in hands, feet, and mind, built without a single flaw; only a god could have that prize; but a mere man, there’s just no way he can help being bad when some overwhelming disaster knocks him down. Any man’s good when life treats him well, and bad when <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> him badly, {{and the best of}} us are the ones the gods love most.|$|E
25|$|Hayes and Kowalski in Edinburgh {{tried to}} {{reconcile}} the logic-based declarative approach to knowledge representation with Planner's procedural approach. Hayes (1973) developed an equational language, Golux, in which different procedures could be obtained by altering {{the behavior of the}} theorem prover. Kowalski, on the other hand, developed SLD resolution, a variant of SL-resolution, and showed how <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> implications as goal-reduction procedures. Kowalski collaborated with Colmerauer in Marseille, who developed these ideas in the design and implementation of the programming language Prolog.|$|E

25|$|The earlier halakha did not confine {{itself to}} the mere literal meaning of single passages, but sought to draw {{conclusions}} from {{the wording of the}} texts in question by logical deductions, by combinations with other passages, etc. Hence its midrash differs from the simple exegesis of the older halakha. <b>It</b> <b>treats</b> the Bible according to certain general principles, which in the course of time became more and more amplified and developed (see Talmud); and its interpretations depart further and further from the simple meaning of the words.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistani Ministry of Water and Power {{reported}} in 2002 that only 1% {{of the domestic}} and industrial wastewater receives treatment. According to the Pakistan Water Situational Analysis, there are three wastewater treatment plants in Islamabad, of which only one is functional. Karachi has two trickling filters, where effluents generally receive screening and sedimentation. Lahore has some screening and grit removal systems, but they are hardly functional. In Faisalabad, there is a wastewater treatment plant, in which wastewater receives primary treatment, but <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> only 7 percent of the collected wastewater in the city. Multan, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala have no wastewater treatment plants at all. In rural areas, wastewater treatment is nonexistent, leading to pollution of surface and groundwater.|$|E
25|$|In Indian law, {{adultery}} {{is defined}} as sex {{between a man and}} a woman without the consent of the woman's husband. The man is prosecutable and can be sentenced for up to five years (even if he himself was unmarried) whereas the married woman cannot be jailed. Men have called the law gender discrimination in that women cannot be prosecuted for adultery and the National Commission of Women has criticized the British era law of being anti-feminist as <b>it</b> <b>treats</b> women as the property of their husbands and has consequently recommended deletion of the law or reducing it to a civil offense. The Government is yet to act. Extramarital sex without the consent of one's partner can be a valid grounds for monetary penalty on government employees, as ruled by the Central Administrative Tribunal.|$|E
