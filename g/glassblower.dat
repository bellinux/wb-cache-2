5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a <b>glassblower</b> and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only be done on the factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|A <b>glassblower</b> is {{attacked}} and hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E

25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison), {{with the aid}} of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a <b>glassblower,</b> glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a <b>glassblower</b> or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.|$|E
25|$|The major tools {{used by a}} <b>glassblower</b> are the {{blowpipe}} (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and {{a variety}} of shears.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} floats, {{including most}} Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a <b>glassblower.</b> Recycled glass, especially old sake bottles, was typically used and air bubbles {{in the glass}} {{are a result of}} the rapid recycling process. After being blown, floats were removed from the blowpipe and sealed with a 'button' of melted glass before being placed in a cooling oven. (This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Glassblowers</b> {{are exposed}} to {{numerous}} physical and chemical noxious factors at their workplace. Mucosal layer of upper aerodigestive tract (nose, oral cavity, pharynx and larynx) is particularly vulnerable {{to the influence of}} these factors. Inhalation of hot gases, dust particles, and oral contact with <b>glassblower’s</b> pipe are the most important factors that can cause chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the prevalence of chronic laryngitis in the group of <b>glassblowers</b> and control group of workers and to examine whether the observed differences depend on the membership in these two groups, on the duration of exposure, or on both factors. The results of the study show significantly higher prevalence of chronic laryngitis among <b>glassblowers</b> than among control group of workers employed in the same plant. On the other hand, the duration of exposure was not statistically significant factor for chronic laryngitis. The exposure to risk factors on the working place represents an independent risk factor for the occurrence of chronic laryngitis among <b>glassblowers,</b> when adjusted for other possible confounders, such as age, years of service, smoking habits and alcohol consumption...|$|R

25|$|In this, {{the seminal}} Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an {{apprentice}} <b>glassblower</b> in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, {{but he believes}} that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower's daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes excellently until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case goes to trial the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes {{in exchange for the}} promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.|$|E

500|$|Wittman {{had sent}} a letter to a number of ceramists in the U.S. {{inviting}} them to participate in the workshop, and asked Norm Schulman, [...] the pottery instructor at the museum school, to facilitate the arrangements. [...] The eight attendees in addition to Littleton and Schulman were: Dominick Labino (then director of research for Johns Manville Corporation), Clayton Bailey, who was Littleton's graduate assistant from the University of Wisconsin, [...] Tom McGlauchlin from the University of Iowa (who had been Littleton’s graduate assistant at Wisconsin the previous year), Karl Martz from Indiana University, John Stephenson from the University of Michigan, William Pitney from Wayne State University, artist Dora Reynolds, and Edith Franklin, one of Schulman's ceramics students. [...] Littleton provided a small pot furnace he had built. [...] In the first couple of days, the participants spent much of the time trying to find a workable glass formula and getting batches of glass melted, leaving very little time to experiment with actual blowing. [...] Labino suggested converting the furnace to a day tank, which would have a larger capacity, and provided some borosilicate marbles to melt instead of mixing a formula. This glass proved easy to work for glass blowing, and the workshop participants experimented with it in shifts {{for the remainder of the}} week. [...] On the final day of the workshop, Harvey Leafgreen, a retired <b>glassblower</b> from the Libbey glass plant in Toledo, happened in to see the public display of the workshop products, and presented an unexpected two-hour demonstration of the craft.|$|E

50|$|The <b>glassblowers</b> went to {{see both}} New Geneva and the Mays Landing site. When notes were finally {{compared}} New Geneva was chosen. After much discussion, a co-partnership was entered into between Gallatin and James A. Nicholson {{on the one hand}} and the German <b>glassblowers</b> on the other. This partnership lasted until 1803, during which time the New Geneva Glass Works produced window glass for the early pioneers as well as bottles, bowls, and other items.|$|R

2500|$|Also {{known as}} the glass {{harmonica}} or glass armonica, Benjamin Franklin invented a musical instrument in 1761, an arrangement of glasses after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval in Cambridge, England. Dr. Franklin, who called his invention the [...] "armonica" [...] after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London <b>glassblower</b> Charles James to build one, and it had its world première in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies. In this version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned {{by means of a}} foot-operated treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note.|$|E
2500|$|A lampworker, usually {{operating}} on a much smaller scale, historically used alcohol lamps and breath or bellows-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as laboratory glassware, beads, and durable scientific [...] "specimens"—miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by Hans Godo Frabel (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practised today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of oxygen and propane or natural gas. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the borosilicate glass (low-expansion) of the scientific <b>glassblower.</b> This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special lathes to help form the glass or fused quartz used for special projects.|$|E
2500|$|The bench is a glassblower's workstation, {{and has a}} {{place for}} the <b>glassblower</b> to sit, {{a place for the}} {{handheld}} tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. Blocks are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation. [...] In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly 6 inches square, one-half to one inch thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece. [...] Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later {{in the creation of a}} piece. Paddles are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.|$|E

5000|$|These early <b>glassblowers</b> were {{successful}} in {{that they were able}} to send a sample of their glassware home to England. However, their operations did not likely survive the [...] "Starving Time", when the colonist population dropped from around 500 to 60. A second attempt was made around 1621, when four Italian <b>glassblowers</b> and two assistants attempted to revive operations. However, this attempt was not productive, due to a combination of factors, including bad weather, the Indian massacre of 1622, illness, and emigration. It is believed that the furnace was abandoned in 1624.|$|R

2500|$|Little {{more was}} done with this {{phenomenon}} until 1856 when German <b>glassblower</b> Heinrich Geissler created a mercury vacuum pump that evacuated a glass tube to an extent not previously possible. [...] Geissler invented the first gas-discharge lamp, the Geissler tube, consisting of a partially evacuated glass tube with a metal electrode at either end. [...] When a high voltage was applied between the electrodes, {{the inside of the}} tube lit up with a glow discharge. [...] By putting different chemicals inside, the tubes could be made to produce a variety of colors, and elaborate Geissler tubes were sold for entertainment. More important, however, was its contribution to scientific research. One of the first scientists to experiment with a Geissler tube was Julius Plücker who systematically described in 1858 the luminescent effects that occurred in a Geissler tube. He also made the important observation that the glow in the tube shifted position when in proximity to an electromagnetic field. Alexandre Edmond Becquerel observed in 1859 that certain substances gave off light when they were placed in a Geissler tube. He went on to apply thin coatings of luminescent materials to the surfaces of these tubes. Fluorescence occurred, but the tubes were very inefficient and had a short operating life.|$|E
