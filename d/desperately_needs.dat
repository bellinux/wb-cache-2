Many critics highlighted Pirkis and his character for praise. At {{the beginning of}} the first season, The Washington Post columnist Tom Shales remarked: [...] "Played both knowingly and innocently by Max Pirkis, he gives the audience something it <b>desperately</b> <b>needs...</b> a character to root for, or at least care about." [...] During the second series, Pirkis was replaced by Simon Woods in order for the show to depict an older version of the character.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will <b>desperately</b> <b>needs</b> to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E

500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who lauded Clarkson for distancing herself from her American Idol persona, but criticized the song's resemblance {{to some of}} the songs on Stripped— particularly [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] (2002). On its release, Brian Hiatt of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "its hard R sound may shock fans who embraced the mellow [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] "Miss Independent" [...] begins with Clarkson singing in a throaty moan over a bangin' hip-hop beat, then bursts into a power-chord-propelled, disco-diva chorus that's not unlike Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger"." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] ""A Moment Like This" [...] was exactly the sort of treacly by-the-numbers ballad critics expected of a TV-contest winner; that's probably why its assertive follow-up, [...] "Miss Independent," [...] was such a surprise." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it [...] "managed to make Kelly Clarkson seem younger and hipper without slutting her up like Christina Aguilera (who, ironically, co-wrote [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the first single from Thankful) while retaining a strong sense of melodic songcraft." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song [...] "gives Clarkson the youthful edge she <b>desperately</b> <b>needs</b> to balance out the Adult Contemporary goo of songs like [...] "Anytime" [...] and [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] Cinquemani also added, [...] ""Miss Independent" [...] is no [...] "Dirrty," [...] but it proves that if anyone can out-sing Aguilera, it's Clarkson." [...] On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the it the number sixteen in its list of [...] "Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time".|$|E

Portraying a narcissistic character that {{would do anything to}} please the audience, Keaton described her role as [...] "the kind of woman you love to hate." [...] Inspired by Neil Simon's 1972 Broadway play The Sunshine Boys, the film became a moderate success at the box office for a worldwide total of almost US$59million. Though some critics found that Keaton was underused in the film, the actress was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli of ReelViews noting that [...] "Diane Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real morning show." ...|$|E

Following that, VDOT began the process to solicit bids from private companies to partner with the state in executing the Elizabeth River Tunnels Project (which now included the rehabilitation of the Downtown Tunnel) through Virginia's Public Private Transportation Act. [...] Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer said that [...] "It <b>desperately</b> <b>needs</b> upgrading." [...] and that [...] "it's a very expensive project and we have no public‐sector resources to pay for it.", which was underscored in the solicitation request, which stated that [...] "user tolls will ultimately pay for the work".

2500|$|The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine {{published}} a paper expressing concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines and the Z-drugs used as hypnotics in humans. The paper cites a systematic {{review of the}} medical literature concerning insomnia medications and states [...] almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, while {{this is not the}} case in general medicine or psychiatry. It cites another study that [...] "found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times as high as in non–industry-sponsored studies". Issues discussed regarding industry-sponsored studies include: comparison of a drug to a placebo, but not to an alternative treatment; unpublished studies with unfavorable outcomes; and trials organized around a placebo baseline followed by drug treatment, but not counterbalanced with parallel-placebo-controlled studies. Quoting a 1979 report that too little research into hypnotics was independent of the drug manufacturers, the authors conclude, [...] "the public <b>desperately</b> <b>needs</b> an equipoised assessment of hypnotic benefits and risks" [...] and [...] the NIH and VA should provide leadership to that end.|$|E
