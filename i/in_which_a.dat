5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic {{mechanics of}} their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|According to Slovak filmmaker Juraj Herz, {{the scene}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> {{group of women}} confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film Zastihla mě noc (Night Caught Up with Me, 1986).

5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E
5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E

Spyhopping, a behaviour <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
