5000|$|Articles {{published}} in Stars & Stripes on 19 March 1943, {{as well as}} Billboard Magazine, and The Christian Science Monitor during World War II credit Clarence Zylman of Muskegon, Michigan, as the original Boogie Woogie Bugler. The lyrics in the song agree with several aspects of Zylman's life. Drafted at age 38, Clarence had been performing for 20 years, beginning with radio station WBBM in Chicago and moving on to several big bands, starting with Paul Specht and Connie Connaughton, and most recently with the Tommy Tucker Orchestra. He brought his playing style to England {{where he was a}} bugler for an engineer company, using his trumpet <b>for</b> <b>Taps</b> and Reveille, eventually being transferred to an army band. Articles in Billboard and The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) support this, including the fact that Clarence was sent to teach other buglers his techniques. However, Clarence Zylman did not enlist in the Army until June 9, 1942, and thus did not play his new style of Reveille until well after the [...] "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" [...] was written and recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Thread limit or pitch {{diameter}} limit {{is a standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the thread {{pitch diameter}} <b>for</b> <b>taps.</b> For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|E
